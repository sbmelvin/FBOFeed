<p><strong>RESPONSE GUIDANCE</strong></p>
<p>Request comment from interested parties to the following questions:</p>
<p>DOGS-S Focus Questions</p>
<p>1. The previous DOGS-S RFI, published thru FedBizOpps.gov in March 2009, identified key performance attributes of the Deployable Oxygen Generation System-Small (DOGS-S) as having a flow rate of 10 LPM and a weight of 15 lbs as threshold requirements. These threshold requirements have now changed to 12 LPM and weight not to exceed 32 lbs. Do you foresee any difficulties with achieving these new threshold requirements? What would be your achievable weight through a development effort? If so, please describe these difficulties in terms of technical challenges and related risks.</p>
<p>2. Additionally, the customer has identified a requirement for the capability to provide oxygen to patients on-demand, utilizing a conserving flow feature. The objective of this requirement is to conserve oxygen and prolong self sustained operations away from AC/DC sources. Please describe any features of your planned system that will address this desire for power and oxygen conservation to include technical approach, whether existing capability exists or development is required, and what challenges and related risks exist relative to the power and oxygen conservation.</p>
<p>3. Have you had experience with developing similar DoD oxygen systems that culminated with prototype units that underwent environmental testing per MIL-STD-810 (i.e., ground &amp; aircraft vibration and shock, acceleration, high &amp; low temperature operation and storage, humidity, rapid decompression, sand and dust, etc.)? If so, please describe the environmental requirements involved in that effort and how many prototype units were used to accomplish a successful test program. What quantity of prototype units would you recommend using to accomplish DOGS-S environmental testing per MIL-STD-810?</p>
<p>4. Can you provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate for developing DOGS-S? Please include your recommended number of EDM units, and three OT&amp;E units in your estimate.</p>
<p>5. Can you identify the major components / subcomponents of the EDM unit and the costs associated with each component / subcomponent?</p>
<p>6. Based on your response to 4, how long would you need to accomplish a successful development effort? How long after that to deliver sufficient EDM units for DT&amp;E and then how long for three additional units for OT&amp;E?</p>
<p>7. The Government intends to award a Fixed-Price-Incentive-Fee (FPIF) contract type. Do you have any questions or concerns regarding use of an FPIF contract type for this effort? Please identify any potential risks/challenges associated with an FPIF type contract for this development.</p>
<p>8. Can production options (units) be accurately priced at the beginning of EMD? What quantity buys would be necessary in the production options to provide the best price? What is the minimum lot size (quantity) necessary for each production option? Please include a ROM cost estimate for your proposed production options based on the quantity ranges you identified.</p>
<p>9. Do you have experience with the FDA certification process? If so, please describe your company's experience with this process. How recent is your FDA certification experience? Did/would you require third party assistance for FDA certification of DOGS-S?</p>
<p>10. If a solicitation is released, would your company plan to propose to the DOGS-S solicitation?</p>
<p>11. Please indicate your business size (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), etc.)</p>
<p>12. The Government may purchase re-procurement data rights. Is your company willing to sell the re-procurement data rights (production drawings) for the DOGS-S? If yes, what is the approximate cost to purchase these data rights? If no, is your company willing to sell limited data rights?</p>
<p>13. DOGS-S requires operation on battery power. Based on a continuous flow rate of 12 liters per minute and weight of 32 lbs, what is the expected self-sustained operation time? What is the maximum projected battery life for a DOGS-S unit given these parameters and technical risks? Is a 40 minute duration on battery power realistic?</p>
<p>14. Do you have a current system comparable to DOGS-S? If so, what is the average operational life of your current system based on 75% usage per year? What is the current phase of development or production of this equipment? (i.e. describe status: conceptual, engineering bread board, in EMD, in DT&amp;E/OT&amp;E, LRIP/Production, FDA certification status)</p>
<p>15. If yes in question 13, what is the Mean Time Between Failure (in hours) of this system? What would the projected operational availability be for this system?</p>

<p>6. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105. Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: https://www.dss.mil/portal/ShowBinary/BEA%20Repository/new_dss_internet//isp/fac_clear/download_nispom.html</p>
<p>7. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, and understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology; (2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's Full Spectrum Cyber Operations Technology, to include testing of prototype capabilities and Information Assurance requirements; (3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; and (4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: For classification guidance see section IV paragraph 5. "Classification Guidance for White Paper Submissions"</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access at the appropriate level at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>John Perretta<br />Telephone: (315) 330-1356<br />Email: John.Perretta@rl.af.mil</p>

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia-Cascade Area Office, Yakima WA will be issuing an RFQ for the following services involoving fish entrainment on or about March 8, 2010. At this time I am requesting firms with the capabilities to perform this job to contact me with a qualification statement and request the RFQ. Contractor Qualifications:To qualify for award, prospective contractors must be able to show that they have experience in maintaining and operating rotary screw traps and have performed similar studies in rivers with rapidly changing flow rates.  Contractors must also have experience in identifying and handling bull trout populations in the Pacific Northwest. 
 Information and interest requests can be sent to:Bureau of Reclamation Connie Morgan, Purchasing Agent1917 Marsh RoadYakima WA 98901or electronically to cmorgan@usbr.gov....no faxes pleaseThe Statement of Work for this service is as follows:Purpose for Cost Estimate Request:The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is proposing to conduct a fish entrainment study at its Keechelus Dam facility which is located near the town of Hyak in central Washington State.  For this study, a single rotary screw trap (RST) will be operated for a 4-month period at the outlet of Keechelus Dam between May 15th, 2010 and September 10th, 2010.  Reclamation is seeking qualified Fisheries Consultants to provide field data collection and technical oversight for field data collection activities for this sampling effort.
A Scope of Work which outlines the required work tasks and project deliverables is provided below.Background:Fish entrainment, defined as fish movement out of Reclamation operated storage reservoirs and into downstream waterbodies, is known to occur at Reclamation storage dams in the Yakima River Basin.  Outlet structures for the five Yakima Project storage dams are not screened to prevent fish entrainment when water releases are made at these facilities.  Past fish entrainment investigations by Reclamation at Tieton Dam (a Yakima Project storage facility on the Tieton River) have shown that the amount of fish entrainment can be substantial during period when high flows are being released.  Furthermore, studies at Tieton Dam have also shown that a variety of highly valued species are being entrained, including bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) which is a listed species under the Endangered Species Act.
Although fish entrainment is likely occurring at other Yakima Project storage dams, the extent or magnitude of fish entrainment is not well known and estimates of total fish entrainment as well as the composition of species being entrained at these facilities has become a matter of speculation.  Current estimates of entrainment at these facilities is based on the rates of entrainment obtained from the study at Tieton Dam.  However, the outlet work configuration and water release patterns at other Yakima Project storage dams are different than those at Tieton Dam.  As a result, entrainment rates for other Yakima Project reservoirs may not be similar to those reported for Tieton Dam which may  lead to inaccurate assumptions about entrainment rates at other reservoirs.  Because listed bull trout populations exist in the upper Yakima River basin, and Reclamation operations may affect this species, Reclamation would like to investigate the amount, timing, and composition of species being entrained at other Reclamation storage dams in the Yakima basin. Reclamation is proposing to investigate the total amount of fish entrainment, including the rate and timing of entrainment, as well as the species composition of fish being entrained at Keechelus Dam on the Upper Yakima River. Timing of the proposed entrainment study would encompass the period when the majority of the summer high flows are being released from Keechelus Dam.  This time period would be approximately 4-months in duration and would occur from May 15th, 2010 to September 10th, 2010.  This time period encompasses the rising limb, peak flow, and rescinding limb of the hydrograph at Keechelus Dam as well as the period with the highest and lowest annual water surface elevations in Keechelus Reservoir.Scope of Work
Reclamation Responsibilities:Reclamation personnel will be responsible for overall project oversight for this study.  Reclamation will also ensure that the rotary screw trap (RST) equipment is acquired and is within satisfactory working order before the start of the sampling period.  Furthermore, Reclamation personnel will oversee delivery of the RST to the work site, and will subsequently install and anchor the RST at the eventual location of trap operation (after consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)).  
Reclamation will also be responsible for obtaining scientific collectors permits from both the FWS and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for the capture and handling of fish, including ESA listed bull trout prior to the initiation of field sampling.  Finally, Reclamation will be responsible for completing initial written drafts of project results, soliciting review and comments of draft documents, and preparation of the final report for the entrainment monitoring study. 
Physical Facilities at Keechelus Dam and Equipment Proposed for Fish Sampling:Keechelus Dam is located near the town of Hyak, in central Washington State (Kittitas County).  It is approximately 55 miles southeast of Seattle, WA. and is 80 miles northwest of the city of Yakima, WA along Interstate-90 near Snoqualmie Pass.
The outlet works of Keechelus Dam emerge from a gated penstock and water released from the dam flows through a straight outlet channel that is concrete-lined for a short distance and then lined with rip-rap bank armoring before flowing into a more natural vegetated stream channel downstream of the dam.  As part of this field sampling work the selected contractor will have access to Reclamation owned facilities at the Keechelus Dam work location.  If the contractor elects to work from a portable job trailer or to temporarily house field technicians at the job site using a recreational vehicle (RV), Reclamation has areas at this facility to accommodate this request.  Specifically, there are poured concrete pads with full RV hook-ups including power, sewer, and water.  In addition, the Keechelus Dam facility has restroom facilities with showers that will be available for contractor use.  Note: because this facility is a secure site, all personnel employed by the selected contractor for use on this project will be required to undergo a Reclamation background security check prior to being allowed on site and before they are issued Reclamation gate keys to this facility.
As discussed above, the rotary screw trap (RST) that will be used for this fish monitoring effort  will  be delivered and installed on site by Reclamation.  The RST that Reclamation has acquired for sampling has an 8-ft diameter drum and has been modified by removing the aluminum center shaft which was replaced with a stainless steel center shaft to reduce wear and to provide for extended life over long periods of use.  Contractor Responsibilities and Tasks:General Sampling SchemeReclamation envisions that the fisheries sampling will occur over a 4-month duration with sampling occurring on a weekly basis between May 15th and September 10th, 2010 (on a Monday through Friday schedule).  The rotary screw trap (RST) will need to be checked for proper operation and processing of fish catches at a minimum frequency of 2-times per day (e.g. 8:00a.m. and again at 8:00p.m.) or possibly 3-times per day (e.g. every 8 hours).  Frequency of RST checks will depend on requirements of permitting agencies, debris load (which should be minimal) and amount of fish being caught (which also is expected to be minimal). 
Provided below are the required tasks expected to be completed by the Fisheries Contractor and the project deliverables for this work.

Task 1:  Project Administration and Field Technician Set-upThe selected contractor will be responsible for the hiring and training of qualified field leaders and field technicians.
For this project Reclamation will require a minimum of 2 field technicians who will be responsible for maintaining, operating, and data recording for the duration of the sampling effort.  The contractor will need to provide qualified technicians that are capable of reliably working under typical field sampling conditions and who can accurately identify and carry out the required fish reporting duties for this effort.  It is critical that the technicians are able to accurately identify fish to species, especially threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus).  Field technicians must be able to take all required measurements of fish captured, take detailed notes, and must be able to release fish alive and unharmed when appropriate.  Field technicians must also be able to collect genetic samples and follow a detailed protocol on fish handling when dealing with any bull trout samples that are collected.
A trained and senior fisheries biologist should be available to provide on site technician training and coordination and to ensure that fish sampling will occur according to schedule and according to specifications for this project.   
Note: As discussed above, all personnel that are selected for work on this project, including field technicians and field leaders, must have a Reclamation background security check prior to being allowed on site at this secure Reclamation facility.  Reclamation will provide the selected contractor with the appropriate paperwork for submission to Reclamation.  Reclamation will also cover the cost of the background checks.


Task 2:  Monitoring of Screw TrapsThe selected contractor will provide 2 field technicians to maintain and operate the RST for an approximately 4-month duration: May 15th - September 10th, 2010 (Monday through Friday for a minimum of 90 total work days).
The sampling schedule will require a minimum of 2 checks of the RST per weekday (Monday through Friday).  A field check of the equipment will consist of checking the RST to ensure that it is operating properly (rotating at proper speeds and fishing according to trap design) and to remove any debris as well as cleaning the drum at each visit.  A field check will also consist of checking the RST livewell for fish.  Any fish captured will be removed from the livewell, processed according to typically used fish measurements including; identification of all fish to species, enumeration of all fish by species, and measurement of fish length and condition of all fish captured.  The contractor will record all information on standardized data forms that will be provided by the contractor.
Any bull trout captured will be sampled using a defined protocol which will involve anesthetizing, measuring, photographing, collecting a genetic sample, and releasing live fish back to Keechelus Reservoir according to specifications of the scientific collectors permit for the project.  Reclamation will provide the contractor with genetic testing kits and will train the contractor provided technicians on the field protocol required for bull trout samples that are collected.  
If the contractor elects to work from a portable job trailer or to temporarily house field technicians at the job site using a recreational vehicle (RV), Reclamation has areas at this facility to accommodate this request.  Specifically, there are poured concrete pads with full RV hook-ups including power, and water.  In addition, the Keechelus Dam facility has restroom facilities with showers that will be available for contractor use.  Acquisition of any job trailers or RVs for use at the job site for contractor use will be coordinated through the contractor.  They will not be provided by Reclamation.   Delivery of any job trailers or RVs used by the contractor must be coordinated with Reclamation personnel prior to delivery to the job site. 
Task 3:  Trap Efficiency TestingThe contractor will be responsible for performing several RST capture efficiency estimates over the duration of the entrainment sampling.
Efficiency estimates are periodically required to determine the proportion of fish that are effectively being sampled by the RST.  Efficiency estimates will be used to extrapolate the total number of fish being entrained at the dam based on the number of fish actually captured by the RST.  Multiple efficiency estimates will need to be made to determine the relationship of capture efficiency with flow rates out of the dam.
For this project, a minimum of 10 efficiency estimates will be required.  These should occur approximately every two weeks of sampling.  This schedule should result in an accurate representation of trap capture efficiency over a wide range of flows at the dam.
The contractor should plan on using equal numbers of both live and dead fish for each capture efficiency test.  These fish will primarily be obtained from the livewell of the RST and should consist of the predominant species being entrained out of the dam which most likely will be kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka).  Live fish should be held in aerated holding tanks that are sufficient to keep the fish healthy until time of release for each efficiency test.  The contractor will provide tanks for holding the fish and will be required to mark the fish by any non-lethal means of the contractor's choosing (e.g. simple identifiable fin clip, dye marks, etc.).  During trap capture efficiency testing, marked fish (both live and dead) should be released at the farthest upstream extent of the outlet works at Keechelus Dam to allow for adequate dispersal in the channel prior to encountering the RST.
The contractor may use hatchery fish for conducting efficiency estimates if and when available.  The WDFW will be stocking hatchery kokanee into Keechelus Reservoir during the months of May and June.  These kokanee may serve as adequate surrogates for fish that are likely to be entrained at the dam.  The contractor can work with both Reclamation and the WDFW to obtain hatchery fish for these efficiency tests if they are available.
Task 4:  DeliverablesThe contractor will be required to produce a brief technical memorandum for delivery to Reclamation which outlines the methods used for RST maintenance, protocols for sampling the RST, and methods used for efficiency testing.  The technical memorandum will also describe any unusual events that occurred during the sample collection period, including periods when the trap was not functioning properly and any unusual or uncertain occurrences concerning fish identification. 
The contractor will also deliver a copy of all data sheets used for recording daily catch data for the RST as well as data sheets for all efficiency estimate tests conducted during the study period.
Finally, the contractor will deliver copies of all data sheets, photographs, and genetic samples collected from any bull trout captured during the sampling period.

Pursuant to Agricultural Acquisition Regulation 470.103(a), commodities and the products of agricultural commodities acquired under this contract must be a product of the United States.  A product shall not be considered to be a product of the United States if it contains any ingredient that is not produced in the United States if that ingredient is (1) produced in the United States; and (2) commercially available in the United States at fair and reasonable prices.  Packaging and container components under this acquisition will be the only portion subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements, as addressed by FAR clause 52.225-5.  Agricultural commodities and their products are exempt from 52.225-5.

For informational purposes, during the period from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY2008, approximately 18,910 metric tons of soy-fortified sorghum grits were purchased. 

The amount and frequency of commodity procured is dependent upon the needs of the program administering agencies, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  

The solicitation will comply with the policies and procedures governing competitive negotiated acquisitions prescribed in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Responsible offerors are required to submit proposals that adequately address all technical and price evaluation factors contained in RFP.  Award will be made to contractors demonstrating the best value to the Government based on the evaluation factors stated in the solicitation.  The Government intends to award multiple indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts.  The contract period will consist of a base period of twelve months, and the potential for four, one-year option periods, if exercised at the Government’s discretion.  

Processed sorghum products fortified/enriched to meet statutory requirements for international food aid programs are classified as noncommercial items.  Detailed commodity and packaging requirements for soy-fortified sorghum grits will be published with the solicitation.

<DESC>Notice of InterestDE-AR52-10NA29853
February 25, 2010
This Notice of Interest concerning the release of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit research and development (R&D) regarding Nuclear Explosion Monitoring Research and Development (NEM R&D) is issued in accordance with 10 CFR Part 600 and 48 CFR Part 35.016.  Offerors should not submit a proposal in response to this Notice of Interest, but may submit a proposal after release of the solicitation.
Description:  The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Department of Energy?s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the Department of State (DOS) will jointly solicit proposals for R&D to improve capabilities to detect, locate, and identify nuclear explosions.  It is anticipated that this planned solicitation will be released on or about March 30, 2010 and close on or about May 18, 2010 seeking proposals with a period of performance of 1-3 years with awards starting in fiscal year (FY) 2011.  Research products developed under this planned solicitation shall support Air Force requirements for improving the nuclear explosion monitoring capabilities and other U.S. verification needs.
The objective of this planned solicitation is to enhance U.S. capabilities in nuclear explosion monitoring primarily with ground-based systems. Proposals that enhance U.S. capabilities that also benefit the international monitoring capabilities in the context of preparations for a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty may be submitted. This will be achieved through advances in the state-of-the-art for nuclear explosion monitoring, basic and applied research that enhances understanding of the underlying phenomena, developing new methods of tackling monitoring problems, or gathering new data for use in nuclear explosion monitoring.
Individual proposals should be directed to only one of the topic sub-areas described below, but the Offeror may submit proposals in more than one topic sub-area.  All topic sub-areas are of importance.  However, depending on the proposals received and programmatic needs, funding may not be distributed evenly among the topic sub-areas.
Research is being sought in the following topic areas: 
TOPIC 1: Source PhysicsTOPIC 2: Signal PropagationTOPIC 3: SensorsTOPIC 4: Signal Processing
Topic 1: Source Physics1a. Advanced Explosion Models. Proposals are sought that complement existing efforts and/or propose new ideas to further understand of seismic energy generation from a range of sources (explosions, earthquakes, mine collapses, and other modes of rock failure), and how seismic energy is partitioned between P, S, and surface waves. Advanced explosions models are sought that include this new understanding as well as coupling of source models with propagation models. New methods of estimating the yield of fully and partially -coupled explosions, and how emplacement conditions influence the observations, are of interest. Proposals for theoretical and observational investigations will be accepted under this topic.If your research would benefit from a field experiment, please list any specific needs to be adhered to in order to get scientifically valid results (e.g., size/magnitude of explosion, depth of explosion, type of rock, and emplacement conditions, relationship to water table, relationship to known faults, initial subsurface stress).  Field experiments may be proposed at the Nevada Test Site or other locations.  Please demonstrate/document in the proposal a genuine partnership to ensure the feasibility of the experiment as well as data sharing.  This is particularly important if the field experiment is outside the United States.1b. Local and Regional Monitoring. Proposals are sought that would produce new understanding of the properties of small seismic events and their seismic waveforms at local (200 km or less) and regional (2,000 km or less) distances. Innovative methods of event detection that are appropriate for local events are of interest. Of particular interest are methods for estimating yield of seismic events recorded at local and near-regional distances with low uncertainty, including methods that are region-specific and allow validation. These methods could for example use Pn, Pg, Sn, Lg and coda. New methods for discriminating explosions from earthquakes that have a firm physical and statistical basis are of interest. Methods that can discriminate chemical from nuclear explosions are also of interest.1c. Xenon Sources and Background. Proposals are sought for the study of source terms for Xe producing natural, medical, industrial, military and nuclear processes, the fate and transport of the Xe released and the regional backgrounds that might be encountered.  Studies and models of Xe and other fission product leakage from historical underground weapons tests are also sought.1d. Infrasound Studies: Seismo-Acoustics. Proposals are sought on the interpretation of signals from co-located infrasound and seismic sensors at local and regional distances. Improved understanding of the fundamental physics of generation of infrasound from underground and near-surface explosions and other sources is desired. The maximum infrasound signal expected from events that do not have a surface component of energy release, such as shallow earthquakes, and the nature of such a signal (impulsive or emergent) are of interest. Experimental, observational and theoretical studies are of interest.1e. Hydroacoustic Studies: Phenomenology. Proposals that quantify the types and variance of events and background noise at new stations are of interest. Proposals that mine existing data for reference explosive events and ground truth for discrimination are sought. Coupling from sources in shallow water and at the air-water interface is of particular interest.
Topic 2: Signal Propagation2a. Velocity Models. Proposals are sought that develop advanced models of the Earth?s velocity structure with predictive capability, especially in aseismic regions and in Eurasia. Of particular interest are: new techniques of determining 3-D, spatially variable velocity models; techniques for building models by fitting multiple datasets, especially of different types of data; techniques to estimate the uncertainty in geophysical models and assess the tradeoffs between different parameters of the models, as well as the uncertainty in predicted observables, such as travel times; studies that compare different methods to show their strengths and weaknesses; and models that can predict seismic amplitudes as well as travel times. Priority will be given to studies of Eurasia. The influence of laterally-varying 2-D, 2.5-D, and 3-D structures, including 3-D scattering, on the stability of propagation of Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases and how these phases propagate to local (less than 200  km) and regional distances (less than 2,000 km) are of interest.2b. Attenuation Models. Proposals are sought to develop local and regional attenuation models, with emphasis on their ability to match observed amplitudes of Pn, Pg, Sn, and Lg phases, their codas, and surface waves. Proposals to develop new methods for measuring attenuation, to estimate uncertainty in attenuation models, and to develop models that fit multiple datasets (e.g. body wave and surface wave amplitudes), are of interest. 2c. Location and Discrimination Ground Truth. Proposal are sought for seismic location calibration, collection of ground truth at a GT5 level (absolute location and depth errors less than 5 kilometers) or better, including dedicated explosions for events of magnitude 2.5 and larger. Research on new methods of acquiring location ground truth will be accepted under this topic. Studies that generate new discrimination ground truth events, along with source geometry and other characterizing information, are sought. Calibration of regional coda magnitude is of interest. Improved techniques for event location using models and/or ground truth at local, regional or near-teleseismic distances, particularly methods that use more than a single type of data jointly are of interest. Robust estimation of uncertainty is an important consideration.2d. Infrasound Studies: Propagation. Propagation of infrasound signals to local and near-regional distances (less than 1,000 km) is of interest, particularly the phenomenology governing reception and characteristics of infrasound signals within the so-called zone of silence. Atmospheric conditions that affect detection, phase association, yield estimation, and event identification are of particular interest. Another topic of interest is the uncertainty in azimuth and range determinations for infrasound signals from seismic events at local and regional distances.
Topic 3: Sensors3a. Xenon Measuring Instrument. Proposals are sought for the development of compact instrumentation for the quantification of stable xenon as part of a radioactive xenon monitoring instrument with the objective of determining the total amount of stable xenon in a mixed gaseous sample (xenon in nitrogen) from independent measures of pressure, temperature and mole fraction of xenon in order to calculate the stable volume (standard cc?s).  This measurement is challenging due to the low pressures (1-100 torr) expected during the quantification, placing constraints on the binary gas analysis technique therefore it is expected that new gas sensing technologies will be developed under this project. The combined relative uncertainty (random and systematic) in the reported volume should be less than 1%. The technology should be robust, field deployable and not require regular calibration (6 months between calibration checks).  The anticipated quantity of xenon available for the measurement is 0.25 cm3 (standard temperature and pressure).  The amount of nitrogen is anticipated to be in the range of 0.25 ? 0.75 cm3 (STP).  A desired outcome from this work would be a compact instrument or technique usable for both laboratory and automated and unattended field measurements.
Topic 4: Signal Processing 4a. Signal Processing. We seek new and innovative signal processing methods for data from local (less than 200 km) and regional (less than 2,000 km) distances that significantly lower the thresholds at which detection, location and identification functions can be performed at an acceptable false alarm rate. Methods that make use of more of the seismic waveforms than simply arrival times and amplitudes are sought. Methods that make use of full seismic waveforms, including waveform matching, are of particular interest. Studies should assess success and failure rates and the effect of less than perfect waveform matching. Estimating improvements in detection, including testing of detection processes using superposition of actual signals in increasing noise, is of interest. Tuning studies, either of specific arrays or of techniques in general, are not sought.4b. Synthetic Seismograms. Innovative methods of computing synthetic seismograms in reasonable frequency bands for local, regional, and near teleseismic distances are of interest. Some topics of particular interest are 3-D computations in large models, efficient methods for 2.5-D calculations, hybrid or approximate methods that have significant advantages over other methods, and methods that calculate realistic spectra or envelopes. New methods that couple near-source conditions to far-field observations are also of interest.
*****END OF TOPICS*****
The BAA will solicit proposals from all responsible organizations (foreign and domestic) including industry, academic institutions, research institutions, and non-profit organizations.  
The United States Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Department of Energy?s National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), and the Department of State (DOS) are strong advocates for the small business community and interested small businesses, small business-lead teams, and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses, are especially encouraged to submit proposals under this BAA.
Federal agencies may submit proposals as prime/lead contractors subject to appropriations language but may not partner with Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).  FFRDCs, including NNSA national laboratories, cannot directly respond to this solicitation as prime/lead participants.  FFRDCs, including NNSA national laboratories, may participate in this solicitation as team members; however, such participation must be consistent with the FFRDCs sponsoring agreement.  The FFRDC effort for any proposal, in aggregate, shall not exceed 50% of the total effort of the project.  Information will be provided in the solicitation on how to include FFRDCs, such as NNSA national laboratories, as a team member(s).
Enhancing programmatic value is encouraged.  Low-cost proposals focused on validation or proof-of-principle issues will enhance programmatic value.  Teaming is, also, an interesting way to add value, for example, teaming to facilitate integration of research products into the Knowledge Base will enhance programmatic value.  Teaming which results in the training of graduate students (in particular university/industry teams working on real world problems with Ph.D. candidates) will enhance programmatic value.  Programmatic value is anticipated to be one of the selection criteria for proposals.  If teaming arrangements are proposed, a clear statement of the intended benefit of teaming must be provided along with the proposed technical approach, deliverables and costs clearly delineated for individual team members.  The Government reserves the right to award to the team or to individual team members.
AFRL, NNSA, and DOS will require a final report of each award and will distribute the final report to each sponsoring agency party to this solicitation, and will actively facilitate a successful transition to national monitoring and verification operations. Awards are eligible to have an NNSA Product Integrator (subject matter expert) assigned at the time of award to help ensure the successful transitioning of research products to operations.  Information about the NNSA Nuclear Explosion Monitoring Research and Development (NEM R&D) program integration of research products into operational form for the Air Force can be found online at https://na22.nnsa.doe.gov/KnowledgeBase.
The funding organization reserves the right to determine which funding instrument shall be used.  The funding instrument shall be appropriate to the scope of work and performing organization.  NNSA will predominantly issue contracts, but financial assistance awards may be used under certain circumstances.  The Department of Defense and the Department of State will choose the appropriate funding vehicle for the award. In the event a contract is issued, acquisition regulations apply per 48 CFR, and a cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated.  In the event a financial assistance instrument is issued, 10 CFR 600 applies, a cooperative agreement is anticipated.
The NNSA, AFRL, and DOS each reserve the right to fund, in whole or in part, any, all or none of the proposals and to award without discussions between the funding organization and the awardee.  Other Federal funding organizations may join this BAA action and award funding instruments based on proposals submitted in response to this BAA action.  This Notice of Interest is being issued in advance of passage of FY 2011 appropriations to provide more time for potential offerors to prepare and to allow awards to be made as early as practicable within FY 2011.  The final number of topics and awards, however, are subject to the availability of funds.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACT - THE NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER (GRC) HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED UNDER THEAMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 TO ISSUE A TASK ORDER FOR ENGINEERINGSUPPORT SERVICES UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY AWARDED, COMPETITIVE 8(a) CONTRACT NNC06BA07B WITHASRC AEROSPACE CORPORATION. THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. BACKGROUND: NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts underthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Recovery act funds for NASAsFundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP) are being utilized to design, develop and testaircraft-engine Ultra High Bypass (UHB) component technology hardware to support theSubsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) Project research into aircraft and propulsion integration.  Thegoals of the SFW Project are to reduce the amount of fuel burned by aircraft today by 33%and reduce the hazardous exhaust gas Nitrogen Oxide, which is responsible for hurting theEarths Ozone Layer, by 70%.  Less fuel burned also means much less Carbon Dioxide, oneof the gases responsible for Global Warming, put into the atmosphere by aircraft engines.NASA has the capability to test scale models that can simulate an aircraft engine byitself or while installed on a model aircraft wing in NASA wind tunnel facilities.  Someof these scale models are concepts of the next generation of todays aircraft engines,called turbofans.  The wind tunnel testing is performed to determine the performance ofnew turbofan engine designs and their effect on the aircraft aerodynamic performance. Aspecial test rig is used to power these model turbofans called a Turbine PoweredSimulator, or TPS.  To enable future propulsion-airframe integration testing of advanced UHB turbofans,design and fabrication of a representative UHB fan and stators for testing on a TPS willbe performed. And, because of the severe operating conditions the TPS unit endures duringtesting, the TPS and support systems require inspection and rebuilding after every testcampaign or before its use in the next test campaign.  This means the TPS unit must betaken apart, the parts looked at with special equipment and techniques, the worn outparts replaced or rebuilt, instrumentation repaired or replaced, and the TPS put backtogether. The lubrication system must have seals, hoses and any broken sensors replaced. The TPS unit control system must also be inspected and defective parts replaced. It alsorequires software upgrades to be able to control the unit correctly for the next testcampaign for any special operating test points to be explored.	This work requiresspecially trained people and special equipment to do all the tasks needed to make the TPSdrive unit operate as it was originally designed NASA/GRC intends to issue a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to procureengineering services to complete the aerodynamic and mechanical design and fabrication ofa new fan and set of stators to fit an existing NASA Turbine Powered Simulator (TPS) airmotor, Model Number 2601 (2601). This fan model will be used to conduct research on thenext generation of Ultra High Bypass Wing Integration Technology in future wind tunneltests.	The engineering contractor will also focus on the refurbishment and upgrade ofthe TPS 2601 and its system components in order to insure the TPS unit can be operatedsafely during testing.	This effort will involve the inspection and rebuilding of theparts of the TPS 2601 itself and the oil Lubrication Cart.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. This announcement will not result in a Request for Proposal; this announcement is forinformational purposes only. All questions and/or concerns must be submitted in writingto points of contact contained herein. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>Langley Research Center has a requirement to increase the maximum value of theexisting cost-plus-fixed-fee, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contractwith the National Institute of Aerospace, Inc. (NIAA) for leading edge research inemerging fields, for education in science and engineering, and for dissemination(including promotion and outreach) of the results of the research and technologydeveloped by NIAA.  The maximum IDIQ value will increase from $36M to $64M.  The increasewill permit NASA to continue to obtain these services from the NIAA within the originalscope and the original period of performance of the existing contract.	The current5-year contract expires March 11, 2013.  Unforeseen changes to the Centers mission and unexpected budget increases resulted inthe shortfall in estimating the maximum value of the current contract.	The statutoryauthority for award of the existing contract was 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3) which providesthat full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award thecontract to a particular source or sources in order to "establish or maintain anessential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by aneducational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and developmentcenter."  NIAA is the only responsible source for increased services that are within thetechnical scope of the current contract and within its original performance period. Therefore, the authority at 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only OneResponsible Source, also applies to this requirement to increase the maximum value of theexisting IDIQ contract with no change in its original scope or period of performance. The NIAA is also the only source that can provide LaRC access to the NIAAs uniqueeducational and research services.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award modifications to Contract N00019-09-C-0007 for non-recurring and recurring efforts required to resolve and implement obsolescence solutions for the Tomahawk Block IV missile, using the appropriate resolution options, including, but not limited to, Life of Type (LOT) Buy or Bridge Buy (procuring sufficient quantities of components to mitigate existing and/or projected obsolescence issues), Substitution, Aftermarket Manufacturers, Emulation, Reclamation, Redesign/Qualify, Reverse Engineering (RE), or Development of a New Source.  As part of the requirements, solutions must be integrated into the Tomahawk Block IV missile and other hardware in order to sustain uninterupted, on-going unit production.  NAVAIR intends to award these efforts to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS).  RMS, as prime development contractor for the Tomhawk Block IV, funded approximately $175M of shared missile development effort.  With this cost share arrangement, RMS retained the technical data package for the Block IV missile and also posses the unique skills required to integrate obsolescence solutions into the missile.  Raytheon is the sole designer, developer and producer of the Tomahawk Block IV, and the only known source that possesses the engineering data, technical skills, tooling and requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, interfaces, performance, operation, maintenance and support characteristics of the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to perform the efforts and integration, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Advancing Clinical Decision Support

The purpose of this project is to accelerate the successful implementation and effective use of computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) interventions to facilitate evidence based clinical practice and meaningful use of health IT.  Funded under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, this project is designed to advance CDS to achieve the following goals:

- Broad CDS Adoption: Facilitate widespread dissemination of best known CDS implementation practices to support effective use of CDS in a variety of clinical settings including specialty clinical practices and other settings that are known to have had difficulties with implementation of effective CDS.

- Improve Care Quality and Patient Safety: Improve the utility of CDS systems to include increased specificity of CDS interventions so as to reduce over-alerting which can lead to poor adoption and reduce the utility of CDS interventions.

- Sharing of CDS Interventions: Improve the capacity to share effective CDS interventions across care settings to encourage reuse and to reduce the implementation and maintenance effort required at each local facility

- Meaningful Use of CDS: Develop CDS interventions that fulfill CDS-related criteria for meaningful use of health IT.

Taken together, achievement of these four goals can reduce major barriers and significantly advance the adoption, implementation, utility, effectiveness of clinical decision support over a wide range of practices, patient groups, technologies, and safety and quality targets. This project will help providers to achieve meaningful use of health information technology through the use and application of CDS capabilities as a foundational step in transforming our health systems to embody 21st century “information-based” clinical practice. CDS provides clinicians, staff, patients and other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care. CDS encompasses, but is not limited to, computerized alerts and reminders to care providers and patients; methods to incorporate best practice clinical guidelines into practice; condition-focused order sets, patient data reports and summaries; documentation templates that help foster best practices of care; processes that facilitate communication and collaboration in care; advice to promote more accurate and timely diagnoses; systems that provide contextually relevant reference information; and other tools that enhance decision making in clinical workflow.

<SUBJECT>Overdose Prevention in Opioid Treatment Program
<SOLNBR>SAM28959
<RESPDATE>030910
<CONTACT>Nora V Tyson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Division of Pharmacologic Therapies, through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to National Council on Patient Information and Education (NCPIE), 4915 Saint Elmo Ave., Suite 505, Bethesda, MD 20814-6082. 

This project is designed to support clinical practice in opioid treatment programs (OTPs).   Specifically, the contractor shall address the issue of opioid overdose.  The contractor shall develop a comprehensive toolkit for OTP staff and patients addressing opioid overdose.  The toolkit will subsequently be distributed to OTPs and state opioid treatment authorities.

The target audience for this educational and training program is OTP staff and OTP patients as well as their caregivers and families.

The purpose of this purchase order is to develop a comprehensive opioid overdose prevention toolkit to increase knowledge about, recognition of, and improve management of opioid overdose among OTPs and their patients.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), House Committee on Appropriations requested in its (FY) 2006 committee report that SAMHSA develop a report on the recruitment, retention and skill development needs of substance abuse treatment professionals.

These groups include African American, Asian, American Indians/Alaskan Natives, Latino, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, older Americans, adolescents and youth, medication-assisted therapy patients and the disabled community.  The specific goal of this purchase order is to develop an overdose prevention toolkit for OTP staff and patients.

<SUBJECT>SAMHSA Tribal Assistance and Consultation Project
<SOLNBR>SAM27071
<RESPDATE>030910
<CONTACT>Nora V Tyson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), 1516 P Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005.  

Consistent with the Federal government’s policy of self-determination, the goal of the consultation sessions is to identify how the federal government can best support Tribal efforts to create safe and healthy communities in the years to come.                                                 

A primary goal of the consultation sessions will be to fulfill the federal government’s consultation obligation under Executive Order 13175.  The sessions will provide an opportunity for Tribal leaders to have meaningful input into the development of Federal policies that will impact Tribal communities.  Historically, consultation by the Federal Government has been done independently by single agencies or Departments.  Although this approach is often the most effective way to consult on discrete or technical policy issues, experience has demonstrated that it has its limitations when dealing with broader, cross-cutting issues such as public health and public safety.  Bringing the key Federal stakeholders together in a single session to meet with Tribal leadership facilitates the development of comprehensive, systemic solutions to some of Indian country’s most intransigent problems.  It also, however, complicates the planning process and can result in an overwhelming array of issues without careful planning and preparation.  In order to achieve maximum utility from each Consultation, NCAI expertise in Tribal policy and operations is needed to help coordinate each consultation session to ensure tracking, reporting and action, if needed, on the items identified.  

Description/Scope of Work:
The contractor shall provide its unique expertise, logistics management, and network with Tribal Leaders and key Tribal Members to improve the Government-to-Government relationship using Consultation to insure that the Government–to-Government relationship is respected and is the standard way that the Federal Government relates/operates with Tribes. It is expected that Tribal Consultation will lead to collaborative efforts and relationships, intergovernmental coordination and support of Tribal self-determination that support local ingenuity and local solutions and results in tangible benefits in Tribal communities that come from the Government-to-Government consultation. In specific, NCAI will provide consultation expertise for up to five meetings; review and conduct an analysis update of the Matrix completed in 2008 and prioritize proposed recommendations and solutions; and host a Consultation session at either the NCAI winter session or Annual NCAI Conference.

Tasks:

Task 1:
The Contractor shall conduct/host a Consultation Session in partnership with the Interagency Work Group for Tribal Affairs to facilitate multiple Consultation opportunities between Tribes and Federal agencies in compliance with Executive Order 13175. This event will be held in conjunction with the mid-winter NCAI Executive Session and/or the Annual NCAI Conference.

Task 2:
The Contractor shall develop a Report from Task 1 that 1) identifies Tribal Consultation successes; 2) Identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the Tribal Consultation process; and 3) develops recommendations for next steps based on the past, present and future options.

Task 3:
The Contractor shall provide consultation expertise for up to five meetings to include an Evaluation Session on the 2010 Tribal, Justice, Safety and Wellness sessions. 

Task 4:
The Contractor shall update the Matrix to reflect the actions taken by Federal Agencies on Tribal issues based on recommendations from Tribes. 

Task 5:
The Contractor shall coordinate with Federal partners to develop materials relevant to the Tasks in this contract to be distributed at Consultation and/or Training and Technical Assistance attendees. NCAI will make recommendations before each meeting in the planning process to facilitate and improve the quality of Tribal input during each subsequent consultation. 

Task 6:
The Contractor shall contact American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) Tribal representatives to inform them of the Consultation sessions and encourage them to participate and assist the Federal partners in contacting Tribal representatives to provide training and technical assistance.

Reporting Responsibilities:
The Contractor will report to the SAMHSA Project Officer and coordinate with the Senior Advisor for Tribal Affairs at SAMHSA and with the Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice

The proposed inter-agency consultation, training and technical assistance sessions are an unprecedented effort to bring together federal policymakers and Tribal leaders around key public health and safety issues.  Because of its close relationship with Indian Tribal governments and experience working with Federal policy-makers, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) is uniquely positioned to execute the above referenced Tasks.  

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Action Code:  P - Presolicitation Notice2.	Date:  February 25, 20103.	Year:  20104.	Contracting Office Zip Code:  217035.	Classification Code:  U008  Trng/Curriculum Dvlp6.	Contracting Office Address:Department of Veterans AffairsCAI-Frederick7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD  217037.	Subject:  Acquisition Workforce Training8.	Proposed Solicitation Number:  VA798-10-RP-00609.	Closing Response Date:  April 12, 201010.	Primary POC:  Lora GrossAlternate POC:  James Poe11.	Description:In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards.  The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.The program mirrors, as closely as possible, the requirements that the Department of Defense established for its contracting workforce under the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act.  The program will be administered by each civilian agency, and FAI will conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the program is being managed consistently.  The certification shall be accepted by, at minimum, all civilian agencies as evidence that an employee meets the core education, training and experience requirements to be a contracting professional (generally the GS-1102 series).The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequently Office of  Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions including mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant regardless of their occupational series are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include Contracting Officer Technical Representatives (COTRs).  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  For the past two years, the VA has been developing classes for the acquisition workforce.  Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide these acquisition training courses for FAC-C Certification, Contracting Electives and COTR, to better establish consistency, and create a more efficient process for procurement.A Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract will be awarded in accordance with FAR 12 and 15 for Commercial and Negotiated acquisition procedures.The anticipated period of performance is for a term of five (5) years.10.  Place of Contract Performance:  Performance will be predominantly at the VA Acquisition Academy (VAAA) in Frederick, MD.  There will be no reimbursement for local travel within the Washington, DC metro area.11.  Set Aside:  This acquisition will be negotiated on a total SDVOSB/VOSB small business set-aside basis.12.  Transmittal:    All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by VA.  This solicitation and any subsequent amendments will be posted to the FBO website:  https://www.fbo.gov/.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be posted to the FBO website on or about March 12, 2010 with proposals due by April 12, 2010.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals prior to offer due date.

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE - The VA National Acquisition Center will issue Request for Proposals for VA-797-10-RP 0006 for Home Telehealth Devices and Services for the department of Veterans Affairs.  The VA has approximately 38,000 patients enrolled in the Home Telemedicine program and are anticipating an additional 32,000 patients by the year 2011.  Award will be made to approximately six-contractors for a contracting period of one base year plus for one year options.  This is a best value procurement, meaning, though pricing is always a major consideration, the VA is willing to pay a higher price for a technically superior product, but will always evaluate price reasonableness.  Below are the specifications for the items being procured.SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIESThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may make up to six separate awards.  VA infrastructure is limited to six vendors to be located behind the firewall and thus VA may not make any more than six vendor awards on the combination of these items.  Depending on the offeror's capability, a single offeror could be awarded multiple line items.  Thus, for any one line item there is no guarantee of how many awards will be made.The home messaging and measurement device, described below as the "Hub" Device is considered one of the required items in this Resolicitation document and includes line items 1 - 1.3 below.  Line item 11 is also required when any of the other line items are offered. Line items 1.4 through 10 are considered modular optional additions to Line items 1 -1.3, the Hub device. These options offer additional Home Telehealth solutions that serve as supplemental features to the Hub device. Not all line items must be offered (except for 1-1.3, and 11 as stated above) to be considered for award. Line item 6 is considered a separate option from the required line items 1 -1.3 and may be offered and awarded (must include required line item 11) independently from other line items or in conjunction with other offered line items. The following Schedule of Supplies defines the eleven distinct items that define this procurement.  The items are (1) the "Hub" Device, (2) the digital image capture solution for the "Hub" device, (3) messaging/measurement/video telemonitoring solution, (4) the digital image capture solution messaging/measurement/video telemonitoring solution, (5) the digital image capture solution software for the "Hub" device, (6) Interactive Voice Response (IVR) software, (7) General Services Fee associated with messaging, video and/or IVR. 8) Optional additional monthly service fee associated with the management of digital images 9) Optional additional monthly service fee associated with data exchange provided via cellular connectivity. 10) Optional additional monthly service fee associated with data exchange provided via satellite connectivity 11) Training.Items (1) and (11) must be offered together if Item 1 is offered; all other items are optional.  Some items have a list of sub-items.  If an item is offered, selected sub-items may also be mandatory; the "Mandatory" column indicates whether the sub-item is mandatory.The device as an all-encompassing solution or separate devices that enable purchase of the required components as separate modular options that vendors may offer in an effort to provide value and benefit in a total comprehensive package will be considered during the evaluation process.A.

Purpose: The purpose of this Performance Work Statement is to obtain Automated Business Services System (ABSS) and Defense Travel System (DTS) Administrator support services for the 6th Comptroller Squadron (CPTS), MacDill Air Force Base (AFB) FL, and to ensure long-term system viability snd uninterrupted daily operations of ABSS and DTS services.</p>
<p>1.2 Scope: The scope of this effort will cover services required to support the MacDill base-level Comptroller organization. ABSS (Automated Business Services System) is a system that electronically processes financial documents and interfaces with Air Force Contracting and other systems. This system directly supports the Financial Services and Financial analysis Flights within the 6 CPTS. The ABSS Administrator at MacDill AFB supports over 2000 users assigned to the 6th Air Mobility Wing (6 AMW) and the following major tenant units: USCENTCOM, USSOCOM, 290th, JCSE, and Homestead ARB. <br />Defense Travel System (DTS) seamlessly automates the three DoD travel processes: authorization, reservation, and voucher filing. By using DTS, travelers are able to generate travel. Authorizations make trip reservations, and route travel requests for approval, all from their desktop workstations. The system is paperless and uses DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates to digitally sign documents all from a desktop workstation. DTS is totally web-based. There is no need to load any software on the workstation other than a web browser plug-in for digital signature authentication and system security. When the trip is complete, the traveler can quickly create a voucher from the data already stored in the DTS system, and then electronically route it for approval and submission to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). An electronic funds transfer from DFAS to the traveler's bank account completes the process.</p>

The family of hand held signals (HHS) is used for both daytime and nighttime signaling and nighttime signaling in the case of the M127A1.  They are used by all military services.  The star clusters consist of five-star illuminant assemblies and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant which fills the propulsion assembly.  The illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between.  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The parachute signals consist of a parachute-suspended illuminant assembly and a rocket motor propulsion assembly contained in a hand-held aluminum launching tube.  The base of the launching tube contains a primer and an initiating charge.  As shipped, the firing pin cap is assembled to the forward end and must be reversed for firing.  Stabilizing fins on the tail assembly of rockets are folded parallel to the axis of the signal.  A bolt, which also transfers the initiating charge flash to the propellant, extends into the center of the solid propellant, which fills the propulsion assembly.  The parachute/illuminant assembly is mounted on top of the propulsion assembly with a delay assembly and an expelling charge between them.  The parachute with suspension chords is packed on top of the illuminant, and the tube end is sealed with a cork disk (rocket barrel seal).  A label specifying firing procedures is secured to the body of the signal.  The propelling charge for both cluster and parachute type signals is Black Powder Propellant.  Black powder is used for the initiating and expelling charge for both cluster and parachute signals.  The No. 209 percussion primer is used in both cluster and parachute signals.<BR><BR>Critical components include magnesium powder, black powder, black powder propellant, the No. 209 percussion primer, and the stabilizing fin assembly.  Critical skills include the ability to handle/store hygroscopic materials, handle/formulate/press pyrotechnic mixtures, and fabrication of metal parts.<BR><BR><BR>Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information:  a brief summary of the companys capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability.

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This announcement is a Sources Sought for planning purposes only.

The intent of this Sources Sought is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a  total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc.  This notice is a Sources Sought for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  


B.  Project Background:
Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest.  While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources are used, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research.  CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings.  For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations. 
As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals.  The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed.  The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient.  
A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes.  Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.  
The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance.  These data are an invaluable resource for CER.  Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector.  As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data; and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical. 
C. Objective:
The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with centers residing outside of the FDA who have state-of –the-art medical,  biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. These centers will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets.  As part of this effort these Centers will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where Center specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse.   Additionally, PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.
The Government intends on using a contract or contract(s) to establish two PACES Centers, each through a separate contract(or set of task orders) awarded to two uniquely different Contractors. Each Contractor will establish a PACES Center to develop and use advanced computational strategies and tools to conduct CER.  Using CER methodologies, these Centers will address potential uses of large FDA datasets as well as or in conjunction with health outcomes data from other sources.  In addition, the Centers will help to develop innovative clinical trial design and data analysis strategies that can be used by the Government to facilitate prospective studies that incorporate CER and personalized medicine approaches.  
The PACES Centers will provide scientific training and collaboration to benefit future FDA-CER efforts and enhance academic capacity and expertise in product related data.  These training efforts will promote collaborative interactions with FDA scientific staff including, support of Postdoctoral Fellows both within the FDA and the PACES Centers; exchanges of scientific personnel between the FDA and the PACES Centers; and the sharing of collaborative studies, including potential joint manuscripts for publication of findings to benefit the medical and scientific community.  Furthermore, the PACES Centers will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops to develop their plans for CER, and to discuss computational strategies developed and the findings from their analyses. This is a new requirement.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR Part 36, we are updating our qualifications data for Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractors interested in doing work in northern Wisconsin and Michigan. This data is used to establish a list of interested and qualified A-E firms primarily for projects that will be awarded utilizing A-E short selection procedures (for projects <$100,000). 

Please Note:  For fiscal year 2010, pursuant to the USDA Annual Set-Aside Policy, AE firms must be an emerging small business to receive consideration for USDA Forest Service contract awards for A-E projects less than $50,000.00. For AE projects between $50,000 and $100,000 only small business AE firms are eligible. Dependent upon the socioeconomic status of respondents to this Sources Sought, individual AE projects may be set-aside for 8(a), Hubzone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned small business firms. Accordingly, large business concerns will not be included on our short selection lists.

Furthermore, there are many Wisconsin and Michigan AE small businesses interested in doing business with the Forest Service. Because “Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project” is an evaluation factor used in the short selection process, selection of out-of-area firms under these procedures is unlikely.

<DESC>1.0	INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUNDThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Space Operations MissionDirectorate (SOMD) anticipates that launch opportunities for a limited number of CubeSatsmay be available on launches currently planned for 2011 and 2012.  These launchopportunities would constitute a pilot project intended to demonstrate viable launchopportunities for CubeSat payloads as auxiliary payloads on planned missions.  The pilotproject is intended to support, and will be limited to, CubeSat development effortsconducted under existing NASA-supported activities.  The pilot project will be open tonot-for-profit and educational organizations (collaborators).  In determining the strength of the CubeSat community, NASA requests additionalinformation with regard to CubeSat projects. If a project is unable to submit a proposaldue to the fact the CubeSat is unable to meet the initiatives launch opportunities. TheCubeSats should provide a notice of intent on when the CubeSat is in a configuration tobe considered for an opportunity. As this is a pilot program, if there is adequateresponse from the CubeSat projects, the initiative could be continued on future flightopportunities.A CubeSat is a type of space research nanosatellite, the base CubeSat dimension is10x10x11 centimeters (one Cube or 1U).  CubeSats typically range from one to threeCubes (10x10x34 centimeters) in volume and typically weigh no more than one kilogram per1U Cube.  NASA anticipates using its authority to enter into Cooperative Research and DevelopmentAgreements (CRADA) under 15 U.S.C.  3710a to support the pilot project and NASA willprovide integration and other services as necessary to complete the launch activity.  Participation in the pilot program will be contingent upon selection by NASA andnegotiation of an appropriate Agreement between NASA and the collaborator.  Collaborators will be required to provide partial reimbursement of the launch andintegration costs associated with their participation in the pilot project.  This partialreimbursement will be due in advance upon execution of the Agreement.  The requiredreimbursement will be $30,000.00 (thirty thousand dollars) per 1U Cube.  The Agreementsimplementing the pilot project will not provide for the transfer of any NASA funding toselected collaborators to support any aspect of the collaborators participation in thepilot project, including CubeSat development.	Investigations supported by CubeSat payloads proposed for the pilot project must addressan aspect of science, exploration, technology development, education, or operationsencompassed by NASAs strategic goals and outcomes as identified in the NASA StrategicPlan and/or Education Strategic Coordination Framework.The NASA Strategic Plan can be found at http://www.nasa.gov/about/budget	   .The Education Strategic Framework can be found athttp://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/performance/strategic_framework.html	     .NASA will not issue paper copies of this announcement.	NASA reserves the right to selectfor negotiations all, some, or none of the proposals submitted in response to thisannouncement.  NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs. Material submitted in response to this Announcement will not be returned.  It is thepolicy of NASA to safeguard all proposals as confidential and privileged information, asprovided by law.  NASA will not, without permission of the proposing collaborator, usethe proposal contents for other than evaluation purposes. It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose proprietary information obtained during thissolicitation.

Proposals deemed in compliance with this Announcement will be assessed against theevaluation criteria outlined in Section 4.2 by the Selection Recommendation Committee, apanel of individuals drawn from the participating NASA Mission Directorates and Offices. Proposed collaborators should be aware that during the evaluation and selection process,NASA may request clarification of a specific point or points in a proposal. Such arequest and the proposed collaborators response shall be in writing. The Selection Recommendation Committee members will conduct independent assessments ofthe proposals according to evaluation criteria outlined in Section 4.2.  After thisindependent review, a final prioritization will be developed by the SelectionRecommendation Committee based on their assessments of the proposals. 4.2	Evaluation Criteria 4.2.1	Overview The evaluation criteria below will be used to assess and prioritize the proposals asdescribed in Section 4.1. The evaluation criteria (which are defined more fully in thesections below) are as follows: 	Relevance to one or more NASA Strategic Goals or Objectives; 	Outcome of Scientific, Educational, or Technical Merit Review(s); and	Outcome of Feasibility Review. Standard evaluation factors for each of these criteria are described below.  The proposalprioritizations discussed in Section 4.1 will be based on these criteria, which arediscussed in more detail below. Relevance to one or more NASA strategic goals orobjectives is weighted 40%, Outcome of Scientific, Educational, or Technical review(s) isweighted 30%, and Outcome of Feasibility Review is weighted 30%.4.2.2	Relevance to one or more NASA Strategic Goals or Objectives Each investigation supported by a proposed CubeSat must demonstrate a benefit to NASA byaddressing goals and objectives of the NASA Strategic Plan and/or the NASA EducationStrategic Coordination Framework.The following factors will be assessed for the benefit to NASA.  Proposals must includesufficient information and supporting details to allow assessment of these factors.  	Does the proposal demonstrate the benefits that the investigation supported bythe proposed CubeSat provides in addressing one or more of the goals and objectives ofthe NASA Strategic Plan and/or the NASA Education Strategic Coordination Framework?	Are these the benefits that were reviewed in the merit review?		Why is an orbital flight opportunity necessary or advantageous for providingthese benefits to NASA?4.2.3	Outcome of Scientific, Educational, or Technical Merit Review(s)Each investigation supported by a proposed CubeSat must have passed an intrinsic meritreview in which the goals and objectives of the proposed investigation were assessed todetermine the scientific, educational or technical quality of the investigation and theoverall alignment of the proposed investigation in addressing one or more of the science,exploration, technology, education, or operations goals or objectives identified in theNASA Strategic Plan and/or the NASA Education Strategic Coordination Framework.The following factors will be assessed.

What were the qualifications of the feasibility review committee members?	What factors did the feasibility review use to assess feasibility?	How were the management team roles, experience, expertise, and the organizationalstructure of the team assessed?	How was the technical development risk associated with the overall CubeSatmission assessed?	If the CubeSat project requires critical technology development for flightreadiness, how were the areas assessed, and how were the plans for completing technologydevelopment assessed?  	Concerning the development of the CubeSat for flight, how was the probability ofsuccess assessed?	What was the outcome of the feasibility review?	How did the proposed collaborator respond to and/or address the findings of thefeasibility review?	Is there sufficient financial support for the development of the CubeSat payloadand for all other costs incurred by the proposing collaborator to support itsparticipation in the pilot project?NASA is not specifying how the feasibility review should have been conducted. NASA is,however, requiring that a determination of the feasibility of the proposed CubeSatproject must have occurred.Any supporting documentation from the feasibility review that is useful in supporting theassessment may be included in the proposal as an Appendix. 	4.3	Selection Factors As described in Section 4.1, the results of the proposal evaluations based on thecriteria above and the subsequent Selection Recommendation Committee deliberations willbe considered in the selection process. The Selection Recommendation Committee may take into account a variety of programmaticfactors in deciding whether or not to select any proposals, including, but not limitedto, available launches and maintaining a programmatic and scientific balance across thesponsoring NASA organizations. The Selection Authority shall be the Associate Administrator for Space Operations.  TheSelection Authority will make the final selection of those approved for this opportunityafter the completion of negotiations, depending on the outcome of the negotiations.  4.4	Selection Notification	The outcome of the Selection Recommendation Committee deliberations will be a prioritizedlist of Proposed CubeSats that then will be negotiated with for the available manifestopportunities.	Selection does not guarantee an availability of a launch opportunity.NASA will notify all proposed collaborators of the results of the evaluation andselection process.  After the completion of the evaluation and selection process, NASAwill begin negotiations with the selected collaborators in priority order from theSelection Recommendation Committee.  The purpose of the negotiations is to define theterms and conditions of the Agreement supporting the participation of the collaboratorsin the pilot project and to align the selected proposals with the anticipated launchmanifest.  5.0	PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONSProposals must comply with the following requirements.Page LimitationsProposal Section	 -	Total PagesProposal Cover Page	 -	1Proposal Title Page	 -	1Points of Contact	 -	1Proposal Abstract	 -	750 words Proposal Detail 	 -	10Appendix	       Resumes 		 -	No Page LimitCompliance Documents	 -	No Page LimitAdditional Documentation -	No Page LimitPages in excess of the page limitations for each section will not be evaluated.

<DESC>The Afghan National Police (ANP) is currently 35% literate in their native languages. This low literacy rate hinders its development as it evolves into a modern police force governed by the rule of law. As with any large organization, effective and concise communication is a basic foundation to the ANP's infrastructure. NTM-A/CSTC-A, in coordination with the Afghan Ministry of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Interior (MoI), provide literacy training for the ANP at 221 locations to the district level. In an effort to increase the pace of raising the ANP literacy rate, we seek expansion of current efforts with inclusion of an intensive literacy program. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements for such a program. Any assumptions made in response to this RFI should be enumerated in responses.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  This is not a solicitation request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this notice.  There will not be a solicitation, specifications or drawings available at this time.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic is seeking Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Businesses, and certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform this proposed project.  
The project will be located at Building W-5, Norfolk Naval Station, Norfolk, Virginia.
 Building W-5 was constructed in the 1920's as a two-story storage facility. Several years later, a third story was added. Subsequently, it became a brig, a Port Operations Administration Building, and then was converted to office spaces for the Second Fleet Command. Currently the facility is utilized as swing space. This facility is now required for permanent office spaces for Carrier Strike Groups 2, 8, 10 & 12. Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) has the mission requirement to provide office space for the Carrier Strike Groups when they are home ported. 
This project will renovate the existing 24,624 square foot, three-story facility and provide three-story additions on the front and rear of the existing building adding 5,728 additional square feet.  Existing fixtures, finishes and walls in the interior of the existing building will be totally demolished. This project will provide a completely renovated space for public toilets, an Admiral's suite (consisting of three offices, a private toilet, and a conference room), vending space, and open office space on each floor. The existing exterior metal stairs will be removed. Existing windows will be removed and new AT/FP compliant windows provided. The existing roofing system will be removed and new provided. The front addition will provide an ADA compliant entry ramp, exterior entry stair, egress stair, entry vestibule, elevator, badge room, and storage on each floor. The rear addition will provide an egress stair, galley, vending space, mechanical room, and electrical room, loading dock, NIPR/SIPR and telephone rooms. A sprinkler and fire alarm system will be added including a mass notification system and a new water line.  Exterior brick walls will be pointed and repaired as needed.
Site work will remove existing pavement and provide sod, new sidewalks, grass drainage swales, a dumpster enclosure, landscaping, bike rack, flag pole, and relocation of existing steam lines.
This project will also have to comply with AT/FP criteria, LID and LEED Silver certification.
The target award range for this project is $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00.
All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, certified HUBZone Small Business, certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether an 8(a), HUBZone Small Business or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-aside is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.   If a full and open competition is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in establishing small business subcontracting goals.  All qualified firms are encouraged to respond. The Government anticipates a contract award for this project in June 2010.  The appropriate NAICS Code is 236220 with a size standard of 33.5 million dollars.

It is requested that interested parties submit a brief capabilities package. This capabilities package shall address, at a minimum the following:
	(1)	Examples of projects worked within the last five years of similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated.

<DESC>The US Navy is seeking qualified distributors, suppliers and/or manufacturing sources of a washable, flame resistant (FR) bedspread/cover for use aboard submarines.   Conceptually, the bedspread/cover could be laid on top of other bedding within the berth, could be layered between a 100% wool blanket and the user (similar to a bed sheet), or could be used in lieu of the wool blanket.
The bedspread/cover must meet the finished size requirement of 56 inches wide by 88 inches long (tolerance  2 inches).  The color is not critical; however, neutral is preferred.  Construction of the bedspread/cover is not limited to a woven fabric.  
The bedspread/cover shall meet the durable FR requirement detailed below through fabric treatments or via inherently FR fibers. The FR characteristics must remain through extended launderings.    
Other desired salient characteristics include a single ply of fabric, durable stain resistance, and good colorfastness properties.
Submissions shall be sent to Mr. Ken Jackson at the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Facility, Building 86, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760.  Submission packages must be received by COB 30 March 2010.
Submission packages shall include two bedspreads/covers, as well as documentation detailing dimensions, fiber type, construction details, and any test results which validate that the proposed candidate has FR characteristics both initially and after extended launderings. Applicable Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) should also be included. Submitted information and the bedspreads/covers will not be returned.
After initial review and evaluation of industry submissions, the most promising items may be down selected and subjected to additional physical property testing at NCTRF.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Treatment, Control and Monitoring of Remediation Technologies, Contaminated Sites and Facilities and Ecosystems (PR-CI-10-10440)
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a "market search" to determine potential Small Business sources in preparation for a future procurement. 
The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD) assistance conducting in-house research into a wide range of subjects related to the environment. This research studies all forms of chemical and biological contamination within ecosystems, facilities, industrial and municipal sites, infrastructure systems or buildings.  The ORD research goals require capabilities for (1)  characterization of  the types and extent of contamination from hazardous waste discharges and oil spills; (2) evaluation of remediation and treatment processes, and drinking and  wastewater systems; (3) analytical method development and quality assurance control; (4) data preparation and presentation.  The research is designed to provide practical multimedia solutions to environmental issues generated by catastrophic or long-term situations. 
This requirement will support on-site bench research and the off-site research resulting from or relating to in-house research within the US EPA or other federal agencies.  The contractor shall provide support on-site within US EPA Cincinnati area facilities, and/or extramurally, e.g., at the contractor?s laboratory or facility; on National Priorities List (NPL), brownfield or field sites; or at a municipal, industrial or federal facility.  On-site support services shall be performed at the Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center (AWBERC) or satellite facilities in the Cincinnati, Ohio area.   Historically, the contract has been utilized primary by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) and secondarily by the National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) Cincinnati offices.
The capability packages shall address the firm?s experience related to : (1) treatment and remedial processes and systems; (2) monitoring and evaluation; (3) media; (4) contamination measurement; (5) Geographic Information System (GIS) and modeling support; (6) research planning and presentation ; and  (7) quality assurance and quality control activities for laboratory and field operations.
 The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A draft PWS can be obtained from the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) starting in late September 2010 with a one year Base Period and four Optional Periods of 12 months each.  Approximately 55,695 base LOE hours are anticipated for each contract period (up to 89,360 hours as quantity options for each contract period) for a total of up to 145,055 LOE hours for each contract period.  The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.  ANY INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS FIRM should submit a capability statement which demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described above.  
Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14).  The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses.  Responses to the above should be submitted to (Renita Tyus, US EPA, 26 West Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, or tyus.renita@epa.gov) no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting.  A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Albuquerque District has been tasked to solicit for and award a project for the UAS FTU Airfield Paving at Holloman Air Force Base, Otero County, New Mexico. The Proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.<BR> <BR>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of the Small Business Community to include Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) to compete and perform a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The type of solicitation to issue will depend upon the responses to this sources sought synopsis. The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsive contractors.<BR><BR>The project is to construct a Parallel Taxiway consisting of 1.25 miles of rigid airfield pavement from Taxiway Delta to Taxiway Alpha.  The airfield pavement is designed for medium load mixed traffic aircraft.  The work requires grading to match existing runway and taxiway elevations.  Drainage structures are designed to carry surface rainwater runoff to water holding areas.  Airfield lighting will be extended along the new taxiway and connect to the light vault located by the control tower. The pavement section consists of 17.5 inches of rigid pavement over 5 inches of aggregate base course over 6 inches of compacted subgrade. 49,100SM (58,723SY) of rigid concrete pavement with 10 foot flexible asphalt pavement shoulders is the total scope. <BR><BR>The project also involves the construction of a Live Ordinance Live Area (LOLA) consisting of 25,000SM (29,900SY) of rigid concrete pavement with 10' flexible asphalt shoulders to park aircraft with live ordnance adjacent to Taxiway Echo.  This pavement also is designed for medium load mixed traffic aircraft.  The pad is designed to park 6 aircraft at one time. The LOLA is designed to drain surface rainwater runoff away from the pad. Airfield lighting is also required around the perimeter of the LOLA.  <BR><BR>The technical requirements of the paving section are:<BR><BR>1.3.1.1   Batching and Mixing Plant<BR>a.  Location:  The batching and mixing plant shall be located on project site.  Water and electrical power are available on the project site.  There shall be operable telephonic or radio communication between the plant and the placing site at all times concreting is taking place.<BR><BR>1.3.1.5   Paver-Finisher<BR>a.  General: The paver-finisher shall be a heavy-duty, self-propelled machine designed specifically for paving and finishing high quality pavement.  The paver-finisher shall weigh at least 2200 lb/foot of lane width, and shall be powered by an engine having at least 6.0 horsepower/foot of lane width.

<DESC><BR>A.	General Information.<BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Arm Slings.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DOD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime Vendor Program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 1 year option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is April 2010.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Arm Sling product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Arm Sling product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR> <BR>B.  Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Arm Sling, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $65,694.25.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Eileen Lentz, Eileen.lentz@amedd.army.mil, address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Eileen Lentz at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D. Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Arm Sling to include at a minimum, Adult size: medium and large.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR><BR>2.	The product has adjustable closure(s).<BR><BR>3.	 Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the shoulder Sling product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>4.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR><BR>5.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.) Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO.<BR><BR>6.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will requestproduct sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for approximately 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Size of product is easy to identify.<BR>2.	Sling positions for proper support of injured arm/shoulder.<BR>3.	Adjustable closure(s) on product are secure.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 March 2010 at 3PM CDT.<BR>

The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Exercise Band product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Exercise Band product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR><BR> <BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Exercise Bands, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $39, 928.04.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their responses with (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of the RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will require vendors to provide electronic responses to technical criteria upon request in the prescribed format of Microsoft Word, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes in the prescribed format of Microsoft Excel.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors need to confirm with the Central Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor must confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Eileen Lentz, eileen.lentz@amedd.army.mil, address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Eileen Lentz at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  The Clinical Product Team (CPT) from the Central Region which is composed of Physicians, Nurses, Medical Technicians, Infection Control Officers and other clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products will develop and approve the technical/company and clinical/performance criteria as well as the evaluation process to be used along with the requirement for product sample sets and literature from the product group.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet and provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the CPT to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of Exercise Bands, to include at a minimum: Medium and Heavy resistance strengths. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.<BR><BR>2.	 Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the shoulder Sling product line. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR><BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.) Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR><BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.) Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO.<BR><BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent for evaluation as directed by the TRBO.  Vendors are required to ship their samples as directed by the TRBO and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive as instructed by, 3 PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  The CPT will evaluate each vendors product sample sets and literature against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for approximately 30 calendar days.  The evaluation responses will be in a Likert like scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (Not Acceptable - worst score), Two (Minimally Acceptable), Three (Acceptable), Four (Acceptable-High Side), Five (Highly Acceptable - best score).  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The CPT has established an overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 for the clinical acceptability of products for standardization.  Vendors scoring below the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be determined to be clinically unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO, and results will be forwarded to the CPT for final review and the clinically preferred product recommendation.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Exercise Band size and strength are easy to identify.<BR>2.	Product accommodates upper and lower body exercises.<BR>3.	Product maintains elasticity during multiple uses.   <BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the overall average target acceptability threshold of 3.0 will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the DAPA price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 March 2010 at 3PM CDT.<BR>

The purpose of the technical paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. Those technical papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitation for proposal submission. The Government reserves the right to enter negotiations on any, all, part, or none of the papers received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offerors proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall merits of the proposal, (2) Importance to Space Control programs, and (3) Affordability. Price, in the context of affordability of proposals versus availability of funds, will be a substantial consideration in selecting proposals for awards, but will be secondary to technical considerations. Price will be evaluated and negotiated on proposals selected for award. No further evaluation criteria will be used. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Principle funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY11. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to a foreign disclosure review. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting focal point, SYSW/PK, Los Angeles AFB, CA: Ms. Aine Nakai, (310) 416-1732, email aine.nakai.ctr@losangeles.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The cost of preparing technical papers or proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The following is required for personnel nominated to attend the Industry Day on 2-3 Jun 2010. Each organization will be limited to four personnel, one of whom must be a security professional. For each person attending, a Personal Access Request (PAR) will be submitted IAW JAFAN 6/0 with required supporting documentation (i.e. JPAS or Scattered Castles printout, SF 86 updated and signed in 2010 and evidence of a local records check). All personnel submitted must meet Tier I standards IAW JAFAN 6/4 with no waivers and must be currently briefed to TS/SCI level. Organizations must have a TS/SCI accredited facility in order to receive, store, or process Industry Day and other related documentation. SYSW/AS will accept the use of a currently accredited SCIF for storage, etc. A CONOPS will be required identifying the SCIF ID number, Rooms to be used and how the information will be segregated/protected. Contact Mr. Gerald Crafton at (310) 416-1591 for additional details regarding submission of PARs, facility CONOPS and accreditation of Information Systems for processing data. All nominations and documentation is due 22 Feb 2010; late submittals will not be processed. Companies who currently have Special Access Programs (SAPs) sponsored by SYSW should contact Mr Jim Austin @ (310) 416-1645. This could eliminate or minimize the documentation required to attend the industry day. BE ADVISED: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracts manager but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition. The Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill, phone number (310) 653-1789. Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered to be "significant concerns" and should be communicated directly to the contracts manager, Ms. Aine Nakai, (310) 416-1732. This BAA will remain open for nine months from time of release. There is no guarantee that awards will be made in each of the identified technical areas. The Government may make multiple awards in a technical area depending, in part, on the cost of individual proposals and the available funding. Proposers are cautioned that only contracting officers are legally authorized to bind the Government.

<DESC>Task Order No. R09E480R06 Contract No. R09PC80029Project Title:  Construction Inspection Weber SiphonsTAS::14 0681::TASBOR Project No. 7.000Award Amount:  $223,446.73Award Date: 2/25/2010Vendor - Colorado Network Staffing DUNS 111480497. 8787 Turnpike Dr Ste 210. Westminster, CO 80031-7028.  Task Order Description:  Construction inspection services for the Weber Branch Siphon and Weber Coulee Siphon construction projects located in central Washington near Ephrata.
The above task order was issued as a non competitive, labor hour task order. In accordance with Department of the Interior Guidance Release ARRA-2010-01 contracting officers should consider placement of a task or delivery order against a bureau's or a DOl-wide Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. This task order is against the Bureau of Reclamation Denver Acquisition Operations Group single award ID/IQ for technical support services R09PC80029 with Colorado Network Staffing an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. The base ID/IQ was issued as a direct award under the Small Business Administration Section 8(a) contracting program. Pursuant to FAR 19.805-1(a)(2) the anticipated dollar value of the base IDIQ contract did not exceed the competitive threshold to warrant a competitive 8(a) acquisition therefore a sole source 8(a) award was made.
A labor hour task order was determined to be appropriate for this requirement and no other contract type is suitable. The elements of consideration, prescribed by FAR 12.207 to be used as guidelines to assess whether or not a labor hour contract is appropriate for this acquisition and that no other contract type is suitable, and the facts related to this acquisition are presented below.
a. Market research had revealed the required services are a commercial service, available under the Technical/Temporary Support Services ID/IQ contract with Colorado Network Services (CNS) an SBA Certified 8(a), Woman Owned business. "CNS" has shown satisfactory past performance in providing similar services in the past.    b. In this particular situation, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence because the inspection services are required as long as construction is underway. The exact completion date of construction is unknown due to the high possibility of delays inherent in construction projects of this nature (i.e. weather, unforeseen site conditions, etc.). The anticipated construction completion date is May 15, 2011
c. In order to maximize the use of firm fixed prices this task order utilizes pre-priced firm fixed price hourly labor rates and includes a ceiling price based on the best estimate of the number of hours that the contractor exceeds at its own risk. The contractor is required to notify the government immediately when the total amount invoiced is expected to exceed 75% of the total amount of the order. Estimated travel-related costs and any other direct costs not covered in the labor hour rates will be reimbursed based on allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulation.
d. There will be adequate Government surveillance of contractor performance conducted by Reclamation's Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).   The COR will communicate daily with the construction inspector via e-mail and cell phone.  Each day the construction inspector will transmit a daily inspector report which will describe the work performed by the contractor, and identify any observed problems, etc.  The daily report will document the inspector's arrival and departure from the work site.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announces its intent to negotiate a contract with Shoes for Crews, Inc, 1400 Centrepark Blvd., West Palm Beach, FL.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Safety Research in Morgantown, WV, has a need for the most effective slip-resistant shoes which are also moderately priced. Previous tests have shown that Shoes for Crews slip-resistant shoes are ranked as the most slip-resistant shoe brand when tested under wet and greasy conditions on a smooth surface. NIOSH intends to use these shoes to evaluate the effectiveness of slip, trip, and fall (STF) prevention practices in food services. NIOSH's research will also try to determine if specific interventions can reduce the risk of STF injuries to food service workers.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that are small businesses and believe they can provide shoes which meet the criteria identified above are invited to submit to the Contracting Officer, within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, a written item description and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. The item description must include references to independent testing or certification of the slip-resistant properties of any shoes listed. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Florence Black at fpblack@cdc.gov or fax information to 412-386-6429. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified small business sources exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement with small businesses.</p>
<p>This project is supported by a justification for other than full and open competition to Shoes for Crews, a small business, under the authority of 41 U.S.C.253(c) (1).</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days after the posting of this notice, negotiations will be conducted, in accordance with FAR parts 12 and 15, with Shoes for Crews as the only source and a contract will be awarded without additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement - Research Corporation of the University of Hawaii/Hawai'i Conservation Alliance (HCA).
The U. S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The HCA shall organize and facilitate  the annual Hawai'i Conservation Conference; organize and facilitate conservation training sessions, as determined by the HCA members - sixteen Federal and State agencies, and nonprofit non-governmental organizations; facilitate and oversee the development of information papers on critical conservation issues, as determined by the HCA members; develop and oversee the collection and distribution of information and data for the effective conservation assessment of lands in Hawai'i; oversee the implementation and coordination of the Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative (and FWS LCC initiative); and organize and facilitate meeting among stakeholders to promote natural resource management and conservation. 
The Hawai'i Conservation Alliance (HCA) is a consortium of Federal and State agencies, and nonprofit non-governmental organizations that work to promote conservation of native species and habitats, including federally listed species and critical habitats. The groups pool funds to achieve a common objective, and oversee the expenditure of those funds through the administrative structure of the HCA.  Over the course of the year, the HCA administrative structure carries out a number of essential functions on behalf of the member organizations. This includes the Conservation Forum, the Hawai'i Conservation Conference, conservation training, development of information papers on critical conservation issues, oversee the implementation and coordination of the Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative (and FWS LCC initiative), and support and organization of meeting among stakeholders that promote natural resource management and conservation. There is no other group in Hawai`i or on the mainland United States that carries out a similar function as the HCA. 
HCA is the only known source because of its uniqueness in supporting conservation of native species and habitats and coordination of such a large span of agencies. Therefore, the USFWS has decided to award this purchase order as a sole source acquisition. No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement. Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the USFWS requirements described herein may submit a response no later than 03/01/2010 by COB to be considered. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only. A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the USFWS. Any questions or comments should be directed to Cindy Salazar, Contracting Specialist via e-mail address cindy_salazar@fws.gov.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<DESC>Electronic lenses (e-Lens) are being constructed at Brookhaven National Laboratory to be installed in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).&nbsp; Two identical units will be created - one for the blue ring in RHIC and the other for the yellow ring.&nbsp; The e-Lens uses an electron beam that acts like a lens when interacting with the RHIC particle beam.&nbsp; Its purpose is to compensate for head-on beam-beam interaction effects by reducing the beam-beam tune spread and keeping the particles away from main betatron and spin resonances.<br /><br />For additional information, see attached documents.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an “Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979.”  (Note:  DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer’s decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).  Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-38.     

This announcement constitutes the only total small business set-aside solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 333298, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. Any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.  

Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government.  The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote.  

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for a Chlorine Dioxide Generator.

Background:

Chlorine dioxide is a gaseous decontaminant, capable of destroying all bacteria, viruses, and fungi, including bacterial spores.  As a true gas, it is capable of penetrating hard-to-reach areas, and can decontaminate spilled liquids.  

The BSL-3 (BioSafety Level-3) laboratory at the National Center for Food Safety and Technology is designed for use by multiple Principle Investigators, and a wide array of pathogenic microorganisms.  While spills are unlikely, it is necessary to fully decontaminate the laboratory at least annually for preventative maintenance.  The pilot plant, however, is designed for research involving large quantities of water, and splashes, spills and sprays are expected to be commonplace.  It will be necessary to decontaminate this room regularly, both to fully clean the equipment, and to prevent one researcher’s test organisms from contaminating another researcher’s work.

Technical Product Description:

1.  A gas generator.  The generator shall deliver a controlled amount of chlorine dioxide gas, monitor the concentration of gas, and time the delivery for optimal decontamination for a room of up to 1100 square ft in area.  The generator shall monitor the concentration of gas in the chamber being decontaminated. The generator shall produce gas to the programmed concentration, and then monitor the concentration for the programmed contact time, adding small amounts if necessary.  Contact time will vary based on the size of the chamber being contaminated. Contact times shall be recommended by the manufacturer, and shall be confirmed using spore strips. The exact decontamination times for individual equipment and rooms are anticipated to be 2-4 hours for equipment and 8-12 hours for large rooms.
Qty: 1

2.   A set of chlorine dioxide canisters as a gas source.  Qty: 2

3.  A room-under-door plate that allows easy placement of all required hoses under doors.  Qty: 1.

4.  Other devices to detect, control, and generate the correct amount of humidity in the room.  
Qty: 1 each.  


Period of Performance

30 days after receipt of award (ARO)

Evaluation Criteria

1.	Technical Specification:  The technical capability of the vendor’s equipment meets all of the requirements in the Technical Product Description.    
2.	Relevant Experience:  The vendor can demonstrate it has provided similar products in the past.
3.	Price.

Technical Specification and Relevant Experience are significantly more important than price.

CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun & Bradstreet number and banking information. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: All questions are to be submitted via email to Ariana.Nijaradze@fda.hhs.gov  no later than March 8, 2010 at 3:00 PM EST.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

QUOTATIONS DUE: All quotations are due, via email to: Ariana.Nijaradze@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 3:00 PM EST on March 10, 2010.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 - STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333314 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested quoter's may submit a quote.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Optical Technology Division, is developing measurement methods, standards, and services for spectrally resolved reflectometry of optical materials and requires a broadband source with high spectral power density and laser-like single-mode output, operating over the wavelength range from 450 nm to 2500 nm.</p>
<p>The optical materials to be measured are used as diffuse and specular reflectance standards in government and industry applications. In particular, diffuse reflectors are used in climate monitoring satellites to aid in calibration of on-board spectroradiometers that measure the reflected radiation of earth scenes. These instruments operate over a broad wavelength range from the ultraviolet and visible to the short-wavelength infrared (UV-VIS-SWIR), necessitating calibrations over this wide wavelength range.</p>
<p>As part of an effort to extend current NIST measurement capabilities in the UV-VIS into SWIR wavelengths, light sources which can provide high spectral power densities over these wavelengths are needed. Additionally, highly directional, Gaussian output is required to enable low-loss coupling of light from the source through a monochromator for wavelength selection, and then on to a sample and receiving optics. Recent developments in supercontinuum fiber sources enable these sources to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>The required light source shall, at a minimum, provide power over a continuous spectral range from 450 nm to 2500 nm with the power densities specified within the minimum required specifications of Line Item 0001 below. The output shall be from an optical fiber with single-mode output over the full wavelength range. <br />All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s). Used and/or remanufactured equipment shall not be considered for award.:</p>
<p>Item 0001 : Quantity One (1) Supercontinuum Fiber Laser Source which shall meet or exceed the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>1. The light source shall provide output over a continuous wavelength range spanning 450 nm to 2500 nm;</p>
<p>2. The spectral power density shall be 0.5 mW/nm or greater over a wavelength range from 450 nm to 2400 nm;</p>
<p>3. The light source shall provide power in the wavelength range from 2400 nm to 2500 nm. Sources providing power densities 0.1 mW/nm in this range are preferred;</p>
<p>4. The light source shall provide total integrated power &gt; 2 W;</p>
<p>5. If pulsed, the light source shall operate at a repetition rate of &gt; 10 MHz;</p>
<p>6. If pulsed, the light source shall operate with pulse durations of &gt; 1 ps and pulse-to-pulse power stability of 1.5% or better;</p>
<p>7. The source output shall be from an optical fiber of length &gt; 0.5 m;</p>
<p>8. The output shall be a single-mode from the fiber end. For protection of the output fiber facet, a thin flat window, having transmittance optimized over this spectral range, and to be provided by the user, shall be installed on the output fiber;</p>
<p>9. The output shall be from a single-mode fiber. The effective mode field diameter from the fiber end shall be no larger than 10 micrometers at all operating wavelengths;</p>
<p>10. The numerical aperture (NA) of the diverging beam shall be &lt; 0.4 at all operating wavelengths. The numerical aperture is defined by NA = sin(tan-1(R/z)), where R is the radius of an aperture that passes 99% of the beam power at a distance z from the fiber end;</p>
<p>11. The light source shall be capable of remote operation via at least one of the following: USB, Ethernet or GPIB interface. The remote operator shall be able to control at the minimum the light output on/off function..</p>
<p>12. The source shall be air-cooled and not require any liquids for cooling;<br /><br />13. The power supply shall operate on 110 VAC, 60 Hz.</p>
<p>14. Tolerances: Optical power specifications shall be met to within &plusmn; 5%. Wavelength specifications shall be &plusmn; 10 nm. Beam divergence specifications shall be met to &plusmn; 1&deg;;</p>

<DESC><br />In accordance with FAR Part 13.5, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to procure professional services on a sole source basis from the University of Florida, Department of Behavioral Science and Community Health, College of Public Health and Health Professions. The period of performance shall be from date of award to September 30, 2010.
<p><br />Brief Purpose/ Background:<br />In 2004, the Advanced Training Institute on Health Behavior Theory (ATI) grew out of recognition by National Cancer Institute (NCI) senior staff and leading cancer behavioral science researchers that supplementary training in theory would enhance the quality and effectiveness of the field's research. Training institutes were held in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008; to date over 100 junior investigators have attended. The overall goals of the 2010 ATI are to: (1) increase the number of junior investigators who have had in-depth exposure to training in health behavior theory; and, (2) to increase the quality of cancer behavioral science research. These goals are compatible with the stated goal of the Behavioral Research Program of NCI: "Our goal is to increase the breadth, depth, and quality of cancer prevention and control behavioral science" (<a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/about/index.html">http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/about/index.html</a>) and the mission of the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, which "is to stimulate behavioral and social sciences research throughout NIH and to integrate these areas of research more fully into others of the NIH health research enterprise, thereby improving our understanding, treatment, and prevention of disease" (http://obssr.od.nih.gov/about_obssr/about.aspx). Key to increasing the breadth, depth, and quality of cancer prevention and control, is having a cadre of well-trained junior behavioral scientists to move the field forward.</p>

Telephone and e-mail conversation as well as in person meetings between NCI investigators and (Vendor) are expected to identify unanticipated issues that will be documented and resolved.</p>
<p>Inspection and Acceptance Requirements:<br />The NCI Project Officer will review all documents produced during the performance period, provide feedback to the contractor, and determine acceptability of progress updates and final reports. The NCI Project Officer will pay the contractor upon completion and approval of the deliverable(s) and invoice(s). This is not a follow-on contract. There are no plans to procure any additional data on this topic.</p>
<p>Sole Source Justification:<br />The University of Florida and Dr. Barbara Curbow are uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because of these key factors: (1) Dr. Curbow has been a central member of the core ATI faculty for all of the previous ATI training events (2004, 2005, 2006) and the 2009 ATI planning meeting and, thus, has a high level of familiarity with the tasks that need to be accomplished; (2) Dr. Curbow, due to her previous leadership experience with ATI, is ready to begin work immediately and does not require additional start-up time; (3) Dr. Curbow has close professional working relationships with other core ATI instructors and is able to draw upon their expertise and cooperation to make the 2010 Institute successful; (4) Dr. Curbow has been engaged in cancer-related behavioral science research with a strong theoretical model for over 25 years and more than other researchers in the field is well-versed with the theoretical and methodological issues that occur in conducting NIH-funded biomedical research; (5) Dr. Curbow is a major contributor to a larger NCI-led effort, "The Theories Project," which is designed to broadly inform the research community about behavioral and social science theories applicable to cancer research; (6) Dr. Curbow has experience in conducting cross-cultural, theory-driven health research, which is rare in the general research community; and, (7) Dr. Curbow has 25 years of college teaching experience including 23 years at the graduate level, most of which has focused on health behavior theories, methods, and research. From these factors, it is clear that: a) Dr. Curbow is the most qualified project lead available for the 2010 ATI, and b) that her employment at the University of Florida makes it the only institution qualified to fulfill the contract.</p>
<p>The University of Florida and Dr. Curbow have unique experience and expertise that are not readily available within the research community. Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through other sources would pose additional undo costs to the government. Therefore, in the best interest of the government this contract should be awarded to the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria:<br />Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the task order; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Criteria:<br />In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:</p>
<p>1. Understanding the Requirements/Technical Approach (30 Points)</p>
<p>Quality, timeliness and clarity of the approaches to the recruitment and training of quality applicants and all delineated tasks in the proposed task order. Timeliness of approach is necessary to get the information necessary to develop and implement the project. Understanding of the Government's intent for this procurement requires an understanding of health behavior theory, health behavior research, cultural differences in health, NIH funding mechanisms, and potential barriers to incorporating health behavior theory into biomedical research. Evidence of health behavior theory knowledge, as well as the skills necessary to training beginning to mid-career scientists in the application of health behavior theory in funded biomedical research is required. Experience with the ATI model and the NCI Theories Project is essential. Soundness of approach to incorporate Government input on the project. Evidence of ability to accomplish the tasks within the specified timeframe is mandatory.</p>
<p>2. Personnel/Staff Qualifications (40 Points)</p>
<p>Qualifications, experience and availability of all proposed personnel, including the ATI coordinator, faculty, and support staff of the relevant literature (specifically, health behavior theory, NIH funding, biomedical research, and culture). Experience with the ATI model and the NCI Theories Project is essential. Evidence that proposed team can accomplish tasks in specified timeframe.</p>
<p>3. Organizational Capabilities, Experience and Commitment; Facilities and Resources (30 Points)</p>
<p>Evidence of corporate capability to organize and manage resources and personnel effectively. Evidence of corporate experience and success in hosting scientific training conferences. Adequacy of mechanisms in place to attract technically qualified faculty on a quick turnaround basis, as needed, and to ensure that personnel assigned to the program are retained during the entire project. Adequacy of mechanisms in place to attract highly-qualified participants. Adequacy of the information technology resources and infrastructure proposed for this project. Assurances that the staff needed for the project are currently available or that they shall be available at the time of Contract award. Corporate commitment to quality of product and deployment of necessary resources to meet the project requirements.</p>

                        MARBLE CONSERVATION PROJECTHAMPTON NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE
Towson, Maryland
SCOPE OF WORK
I.	GENERAL INFORMATION 
Hampton National Historic Site is seeking stabilization and conservation treatment of a group of historic marble garden urns and cemetery headstones and monuments. The garden urns were originally placed around the grounds of Hampton NHS and in the formal parterre gardens in the mid-19th century. Most have been outside in the gardens since first acquired by Eliza and John Ridgely in c. 1851, thus they have been exposed to the elements for over 150 years. Thirty-nine original white marble, campana-shaped urns on low square bases have survived in varying conditions. Many have become unstable on their bases and need immediate attention so they will not fall. The headstones and other monuments are from the Ridgely family cemetery on the southeast corner of Hampton NHS. This cemetery was originally established around the time the mansion was completed (1790) and has had family burials from that time until c. 1990. Of the thirty-five marble monuments and head stones, ten are unstable or removed because of instability and need to be reattached.
Description and present conditionThe attached reports by Hampton Resource staff ("2009 Urn Inventory and Condition Assessment;" "2009 Cemetery Stone Inventory and Condition Assessment") give the location, condition description, and preliminary conservation needs of each of the thirty-six garden urns and thirty-five cemetery monuments. The individual objects are in priority order for treatment and are color-coded according to the urgency of the need for stabilization and other repairs.
II.	 STATEMENT OF WORK The project will be guided throughout by the technical consultation and participation of a qualified Conservator (as defined by American Institute for Conservation [AIC] guidelines) with assistance from experienced Preservation Technicians. Conservation actions will address problems identified in the attached reports compiled by Hampton Resource staff. Conservation treatment will follow a systematic approach, as outlined in these reports. All work will be accomplished in compliance with AIC and National Park Service (NPS) guidelines, to promote long long-term stewardship of primary park resources.
1.	Conservation Treatment 
  The treatment of the objects will include the following as needed according to the attached reports: "	Removal of existing corroded iron pins in marble urns and gravestones."	Replacement of iron pins with fiberglass rods."	Urns and gravestones that are in unstable condition and that lack pins will have fiberglass rods installed.o	Methodology for stabilization of urns with corroded or missing iron pins: The contractor shall transport the drill rig to the vicinity of the urns. The drill is to be positioned directly above the center of the urn or directly over the center iron pin.  Depending upon the individual urn, the appropriately sized drill bit shall be used to drill down through the center to the bottom; water is used as a coolant.  The core of the urn and base shall be drilled out to completely remove the iron pin(s). A fiberglass rod shall be inserted into the core and used to secure the urn to the base.  If considered necessary for stability, the hole surrounding the rod shall be packed with lead wool to ensure a tight friction fit.  "	The contractor shall return from storage repaired and stabilized urns back to their original positions on the site."	Repair cracks with mortar or other materials as recommended by Conservator. A number of the urns display fissures in the marble; several are associated with rusted iron pins.  To lessen the amount of rain water running into these fissures, a slurry of lime putty will be wicked into the fissure. When hardened and cured, the lime putty will serve to fill the fissure."	Reattachment of large broken elements and loose pieces will be done with appropriate materials as recommended by Conservator. Small chips in the urns will not be repaired.  Larger chips--those that are aesthetically disfiguring--will be fit with a cementitious or synthetic fill material; the exact material to be determined on site."	Urns that are set directly into a concrete foundation will remain in their positions; the iron pins securing them in place will be removed and the new pins set into a hole that extends down through the concrete foundation."	Broken urns will be repaired using pins and an adhesive; the adhesive will be determined on site by Conservator.  Losses along break edges will be filled with a cementitious patching compound."	 Move and reset specified urns in new locations on stable foundation of gravel. Urns that are set directly on the ground will be reset on a bed of sharp gravel.  The soil will be excavated to a depth of about one foot and of a width that is slightly larger than the width of the marble base.  Gravel will be placed in the hole and tamped to form a rigid mass.  The urn will be re-set into position on top of the gravel.
"	Die-and-base gravestones that are not stable and lack pins shall have two holes drilled in the base and the die, in locations determined by the NPS, and of lengths similar to that described above.  The gravestones shall then be fit with fiberglass rods, as described above, and then set back into their original locations in the cemetery, as described above. 
o	Methodology for stabilization of die-and-base gravestones with corroded or missing iron pins: Stabilization of the die-and-base gravestones shall follow a similar process as that of the urns.  Dies and bases of unstable gravestones shall be separated.  Each element shall be placed in the drill rig, and the existing pins removed in the manner described above.  The holes in the die shall be drilled to a depth of one-third of the height of the die.  Fiberglass rods (of a length to extend from the base all the way up to the top of the die holes) shall be set into the holes in the base and secured with lead wool, packed in place.  The die shall then be set onto the base with lead spacers in between.  Gravestones shall be set onto a gravel bed in their original positions in the cemetery.  The gravel shall be covered with sod.
"	Repair cracks with mortar or other materials as recommended by Conservator. "	Reattachment of large broken elements and loose pieces will be done with appropriate materials as recommended by Conservator. 
2.	Conservation Treatment
 Preservation Technicians under the direction of the Conservator shall complete the treatment as specified. Unforeseen conditions of urns or gravestones shall be brought to the attention of the NPS immediately.All work will be accomplished in compliance with AIC ethics and standards of practice and NPS guidelines.

This final Treatment Report shall include photographic documentation of the statue before, during, and after treatment using digital images to be supplied in WORD compatible and PDF formats.  All images used to be provided   on a separate CD or DVD in JPEG Format.

NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR
The following will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government:
1.  The basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier's past performance history for the Federal Supply Class of the supplies being purchased.  This procurement will use the following in the evaluation of past performance:
CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT RATING SYSTEM (CPARS)/PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM (PPIRS)
(a) Pursuant to FAR 42.1502, this contract is subject to DoD's Contractor Performance Assessment System (CPARS). CPARS is an automated centralized information system accessible via the Internet that maintains reports of contractor performance for each contract. CPARS is located at: http://cpars.navy.mil. Further information on CPARS is available at that web-site.
(b) Under CPARS, the Government will conduct annual evaluations of the contractor's performance. The contractor has thirty (30) days after the Government's evaluation is completed to comment on the evaluation. The opportunity to review and comment is limited to this time period and may be extended on a case by case basis. Failure to review the report at this time will not prevent the Government from using the report. 
(c) The CPARS system requires the Government to assign the contractor a UserID and password in order to view and comment on the evaluation. Provide the name(s) of at least one individual (but not more than three) that will be assigned as your Defense Contractor Representative for CPARS.
(d) Additionally the Government in conducting source selection may access Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). This system provides timely and pertinent contractor past performance information for use in making source selection decisions. PPIRS assist Federal acquisition officials make source selections by serving as the single source for contractor past performance data. Past performance information includes, for example, the contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customer. Confidence in a prospective contractor's ability to satisfactorily perform contract requirements is an important factor in making best value decisions in the acquisition of goods and services. Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror's ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance shall be considered.
(e) Contractors may view only their own data at www.ppirs.gov. Contractor access to PPIRS is gained through the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) process. A contractor must be registered in CCR and must have created a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) in the CCR profile to access their PPIRS information.
2.  Award will be made at the Lowest Price, Technically Acceptable offer, acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth herein, and the determination of responsibility pursuant to FAR 9.1.  Technical acceptability will be based on the offeror providing all items required without exceptions and an acceptable delivery schedule.  An acceptance delivery schedule is within receipt of all items within seven (7) days ARO or less.
Central Contractor Registration (CCR) - Offeror must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award.  Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/.   Failure to obtain certification will deem the contractor unacceptable, and no longer considered for award.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>"Construction Language and Terms"<br /><br />Many members of GSA's acquisition workforce hold positions that are non-architect/engineer in nature. These non-technical employees, such as: contracting officers, property managers, realty specialist, project specialists, etc., routinely participate in the spec-writing process, pre-proposal conferences, and pre-construction meetings where construction language and terminology are often used. However, very few of these non-technical employees have enough exposure to construction language/expressions to effectively follow-on during these phases of the acquisition process.</p>
<p>GSA (PBS/Region 5) is seeking a 1 or 2-day course on the basics of construction language and terminology. The purpose of this course is to introduce basic construction jargon to non-technical professionals. The goal is to introduce non-technical employees to prevalent construction lingo so that they will be better able to follow along in a construction meeting. This course can be provided as a class or a seminar.</p>
<p>This course is required to be available for the dates: March 31 if a 1-day course (March 30-31, 2010 if a 2-day course)</p>
<p>Offerors should provide a course curriculum or proposal detailing how the class will be presented.</p>
<p>Offerors should submit the number of CLPs that will be earned</p>
<p>Offerors should submit the names of potential course instructors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008)<br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JULY 2009)</p>
<p>Alternate I (Apr 2002) Offerors shall include a copy of this provision with their offer.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Technical Capability<br />2. Price<br />3. Delivery<br />4. Past Performance <br />Award will be made to the offer or proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery, and past performance in the above order of precedence. <br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br /><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-851)<br />2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-267-2285<br />Fax: 202-267-4011</p>

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Solicitation: This document includes all contract clauses and should be downloaded for future reference. It also includes Supplemental Instructions for preparing a proposal. (Note that various choices exist due to the variety of products addressed by this schedule, notably FOB terms. Please disregard clauses which do not reflect your commercial practices.) Do not submit with your proposal.
Vendor Response Document: A "subset" of the Solicitation Document, the Vendor Response Document addresses those clauses which require information from the offeror. The first page provides instructions on how to submit an electronic offer, http://eoffer.gsa.gov, as well as the directions to submit a paper proposal. The Vendor Response Document must be submitted with any proposal and the last page includes a list of other required items. REQUIRED.
SF 1449: This Standard Form will serve as the first page of any contract which may be awarded. Due to the nature of schedules, not all blocks apply, so please complete blocks 12, 17 and 30 only.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION AND EXTENDS THE RESPONSE TIME TO 6pm MTN TIME, MONDAY MARCH 1, 2010. <br />Mil Spec-C-5541 Class 3 does allow for using processes that do not violate EPA standards, so equivalent corrosion control film standards are fine. However, the vendor (in accordance with the mil standard) must provide a signed certification document that states their corrosion control film/immersion method meets or exceeds Mil Spec-C-5541 Class 3. NOAA will look out for this during the first article acceptance.
<p>The preferred method for item reference identification markings is either etching or stamping per MIL-STD-130. Most companies now have a forced black ink print system that acts to permanently etch an image on to the metal before the corrosion control is applied. However, some companies hand stamp with a permanent black ink afterwards. Either is fine. What ever they do they should ensure it is neatly and clearly applied and that it will be permanent! The scheme of course (per the drawing) would be OWY55ASSY-2310031-301</p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;">&nbsp;Vendors: Please Note that the following inquiries have been received and addressed by this office as of this date 2/5/2010- 2/25/2010.</p>
</strong></span>
<p>How do I calculate my quote?<br /><br />Response:<br /><br />I cannot tell you what to quote. A quote is the contractor's responsibility. If you are independent contractor, then you would use the same standard as applied to your current customers. <br /><br />How Do I provide an annual quote as reflected on Page 7 when there are no p<br />per page or the hours? <br /><br />Response:</p>
<p>-On Page 7, is not asking for an annual price-but a per hearing price which would be effective for the entire ordering period of performance at that particular site.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />The solicitation indicates reporters will not be paid per page or per hours. It also indicates there will be no appearance fee. How can I calculate my quote without knowing the number of hours for a hearing and preparation time?<br /><br />Response:<br /><br />This is not a traditional court reporter&nbsp;opportunity.&nbsp;The reference to no per page quote or per hour refers to the fact that no transcripts are required as a deliverable. Therefore, you cannot provide a quote on a per page basis. You are to quote per hearing as the directions indicate on Page 7.</p>
<p>The estimate length of the hearing as indicated in the Blanket Purchase Agreement is 1 1/2 hours. This is an approximate time.</p>
<p>Preparation time is not excessive and can be considered as part of the 1 1/2 hour estimate.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Clarification Information. This appears in the foreword of the RFQ package.<br /><br /></strong>Response:<br /><br />This is not a traditional court reporter opportunity therefore no appearance fee is acceptable. The only fee that you will receive is the quoted price per hearing. If it is a remote site, then you will be able to choose either to include mileage or list it as a separate line item. Your choice. Mileage is outside of the 75 miles commuting area and will be paid at the current Government per diem rate for the ordering period of performance.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Additional Clarification</strong>. This appears in the foreword of the RFQ package.<br /><br />Response:<br /><br />The product will be uploaded to a server upon completion of the hearing. That is all of the deliverable you will provide. <br /><br /><br />Why does the invoice ask for page total?<br /><br />Response:<br /><br />&nbsp;The invoice reflects the possibility of multiple hearings in a month. If this occurs, you will need to list each of the hearings you attended and then tally the total amount due to you at the bottom of the page. The example provided sets out the method by which you would show the hearings you have attended and the product you delivered.<br /><br />It is essential that you read the package in its entirety because it gives you an approximate hearing length and sets forth the process.</p>
<p><br />There are over 120 vendors located throughout the Mid-Atlantic region and their pricing is confidential. If you are to respond to this RFQ, you must develop your own pricing plan(s).<br />Please note that this is a Verbatim Hearing Reporter Contractor opportunity and that it is not the traditional court reporting process with a transcript as a deliverable end product.</p>
<p><br />1) Please identify the parameters surrounding the scheduling of SSA hearings. In the information it states that the VHR is to be available from 8:00 to 5:00 five days a week. Are hearings conducted every day all day and is the chosen vendor required to be onsite during the entire timeframe?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br /><br />The BPA does not indicate that you are to be available from 8 AM to 5 PM. It reads that hearings are conducted between this timeframe. Further, there is no guarantee that you will be working 5 days a week.<br /><br />Yes, if you are scheduled for 5 hearings, you are expected to remain on site. If there is a break in the hearing schedule between the morning and afternoon sessions, then as a contractor it would not be necessary for you to remain on site.<br />Please remember that this is a contractor opportunity and not employee.&nbsp; Unless you&nbsp;are recording a hearing, you will only have access to public&nbsp;areas only.&nbsp; You will only be able to use public restrooms whether you are&nbsp;recording a hearing or not.&nbsp; No&nbsp;SSA or ODAR employee including the Hearing Office Director, Schedulers or Administrative Law Judge has the ability to amend this requirement. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />2) What type of training will be provided for the equipment? Where does the training take place and for how long and at what location?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />The VHR is generally provided training at the Hearing Office or a site in close proximity to the performance site. Training should not be longer than 1 session and is not&nbsp;chargeable.<br /><br />3) It is clearly stated that the chosen vendor only gets paid for the delivery of the final product. In that regard, please confirm the chosen vendor could attend multiple hearings and in the event a final product is not requested for said hearing(s) no compensation will be paid?<br /><br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />The vendor shall only be paid for the delivery of a final product. A final product consists of a full hearing. In the event of a dismissal, cancellation or no show, the vendor receives $5.00. <br /><br />In the event of a continuance, the vendor receives full compensation because there will be a final product in the form of a CD and the recorded hearing notes. This is the final product.<br /><br />We do not request final products; they either are produced or not produced in accordance with the above.<br /><br />Further, if the vendor does not produce a usable product due their failure to turn on the equipment or format the CD, then they do not receive compensation. This may be a situation where the vendor is assessed damages for failing to record a hearing.<br /><br /><br />4) Who has the option to request/order the final product from the chosen vendor? What is the frequency of requests for the final product relative to the hearings attended (on average)?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />There is no option to request or order a hearing final product. This is not a traditional court reporter situation. A final product is the CD and only when a final product is delivered will full payment be made to the VHR.</p>
<p>5) What locations(s) is the chosen vendor required to deliver the final product to? Is there ever an occasion where delivery is required outside of the performance site?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />The vendor is required to record and upload the CD to a server when a hearing is conducted in the Hearing Office.&nbsp; For remote sites,&nbsp;the CD is either given to the Administrative Law Judge or sent by mail to the Hearing Office upon completion of the hearing. You may not include invoices in this submission.</p>
<p>6) On Page 11-F of the RFQ it addresses the failure to deliver a complete final product. What does a hearing cost and/or how can the chosen vendor assess an estimate as to potential "actual damages" in the event he or she cannot deliver the final product due to unanticipated circumstances?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />This is not something which I cannot accurately address. The cost may range from several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. The best course of action is for the vendor to ensure that the final product is delivered as required.<br /><br />If you completed a hearing, then it is your responsibility as a contractor to get the final product to SSA. Please understand that the VHR's are recording Disability Hearings. These hearings determine whether an individual seeking Disability under the Social Security Laws will receive benefits which will enable him or her to secure life's essentials such as food, housing and medical care. I cannot stress the importance of these hearings and the importance of the VHR following through by providing the final product.<br /><br />7) What is a FD-258 and is there a cost for this?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />This is a fingerprint chart and yes there is a charge for this. However, fingerprints and forms are only issued to individuals who have been awarded a BPA. <br /><br /><br />8) The RFQ states that the chosen vendor is to conclude his or her rationale for the pricing submitted. If this is a requirement where specifically this information should be provided?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />The information should be included with the pricing pages.<br /><br /><br />9) After Year 1 of the Agreement are the successive one year periods effective upon the mutual agreement of the parties or is this Agreement a 5 year legal/contractual obligation where the chosen vendor is not afforded a right of termination for convenience (without cause) and/or a similar contractual right to decide whether or not to continue providing this service at the conclusion of Year 1?<br /><br />RESPONSE:<br />Either party may opt to continue to accept or provide service. If you are awarded a BPA and chose to resign, then a letter of resignation to this office is required. No punitive action will be taken provided that you have no outstanding final products. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Additional Inquiries:</strong></p>
<p>Equipment and CD's will be provided by the Agency. The VHR is required to one of the following: <br />1. In Hearing Office Sites- upload the CD to the server <br />2. In Remote Office Sites- either gives CD to Administrative Law Judge or Mail (at the VHR's expense) to the Hearing Office of record within the specified timeframe established by the Hearing Office.</p>
<p>This is not a highly technical contractor opportunity, but it does require knowledge of a computer. The ability to operate the equipment and upload the CD.</p>
<p>This is not a traditional court reporter requiring RealTime, transcripts or videoconferencing skills. The individual will need to have the basic computer skills to operate the provided equipment <span><strong><br /><br /></strong><br /></span></p>

<DESC>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100.
This notice is a sources sought synopsis with specific interest in small business capability. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract. The work is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice is prepared in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This synopsis is published with the intent of determining whether sufficient interest exists to solicit the requirement as a small business set aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)/Aircraft Parts, and Auxiliary Equipment, and Aircraft Engine Parts," size standard of 1,500 employees. 
The Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Material Command, intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity A&AS contract(s) for the work characterized in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contract period of performance is anticipated to be five (5) years, with no option periods, and the ceiling is anticipated to be three billion ($3,000,000,000.00) dollars. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."
Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:
1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.
2. State your company's business size and status (including but not limited to: small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically under-utilized business zone (HUBZone) small business) in conjunction with NAICS code 541712, size standard of 1,500 employees.
3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address. 
Strategy - One or more ID/IQ contracts would be awarded, comprising a consolidated scope, constituting all studies, projects, deliverables, and Professional and Management Assistance (PMA) for all labor categories contained in the attached draft PWS (the prime contractor and team on each awarded contract would be responsible for performing in all labor categories). Note that this award strategy requires prime contractors to propose on all labor categories. If interested in this award strategy, please respond as stated above and state your industry perspective as to the pros and cons of this approach. 
Do not mark your information "company proprietary" or with any other type of restriction. Any information submitted will become the property of the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with courtesy copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil. All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov, and The Preaward Information Exchange System (PIXS), https://pixs.wpafb.af.mil/. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review these sites frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx! , will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by 17 March 2010. Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.

<p dir="ltr">Amended solicitation as follows:<br /><br />1.The due date for offers is extended to 12:00 Noon Pacific time on Monday March 1, 2010. This is in response to various requests and issues that have arisen. Any offeror who has submitted proposal documents need not resubmit, but all offerors may revise their offerors and/or submit additional material. We strongly suggest that offerors who have already submitted review their proposals for completeness against the solicitation requirements. We do not anticipate further extensions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We will consider offers for systems that meet the performance criteria specified but which might technically deviate in minor ways. Such systems must be functionally equivalent to what is specified. Such alternative offers must clearly itemize all points of deviation from the specifications. GSA reserves the right to decide what deviates excessively and to not consider such an alternative offer. We will not consider changes in terms of contractual terms and conditions, or alternative business methods (e.g., mandatory maintenance agreements, lease agreements, etc.). Offerors may submit both conforming and alternative offers, so long as all documents clearly indicate to which offer they apply.</p>

<DESC>On 29 April 2009, the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Wing posted Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8807-09-R-0003 for the GPS Advanced Control Segment (OCX) on FedBizOps. The GPS Advanced Control Segment (OCX) will provide command, control, and mission support for the Block II and Block III family of satellites, support existing and new interfaces, and support the evolution of the system to a net-centric paradigm. OCX will ensure protection of GPS data critical to determining warfighter position, velocity, and time; monitor and control new M-code encrypted GPS signal and civil signals (L1C, L2C, and L5); and connect GPS data to the Global Information Grid so that warfighters around the globe have immediate access to GPS data and constellation status. The subject OCX contract acquires OCX Blocks 1 and 2, two GPS System Simulators, and two Crew Training Systems. It also includes options for a capability maturation effort to evolve capabilities for OCX Blocks 3 and 4 and sustainment for Blocks 1 and 2. As a result, two proposals were submitted.
<p>GPSW awarded contract number FA8807-10-C-0001 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) on 25 February 2010 to Raytheon Company, 16800 E CentreTech Pky, Aurora, CO 80011-9046. The face value of this action is $886,440,679. The contract will be funded with FY 10 research and development funds.</p>

ARRA funds for NASAs Fundamental Aero Program are being utilized to help design andfabricate combustor rig improvements to enable testing of advanced low nitrogen oxide(NOx) injector designs. The Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig located at the NASA Glenn Research Center is ahigh-pressure, high-temperature combustion rig that simulates combustor inlet testconditions.  The Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig is equipped to measure both gasemissions and perform nonintrusive laser diagnostic emission testing in a high pressurehigh temperature environment that mimics the conditions of high pressure ratio jet enginecombustor section.  This unique combustion test rig allows researchers and enginecompanies to test sector combustors that will be used in future aircraft engines.NASA/GRC has issued a task order under existing contract NNC06BA07B to procureengineering services to support the design and fabrication of the upgrade of the existingNASA GRC Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig test section plenum hardware and its supportingwater-cooling subsystems.  These upgrades will increase the Advanced Subsonic CombustionRigs testing capabilities which will allow the development of prediction and analysistools for reduced uncertainty in the combustor test article design process.THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. A CPAF order is appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.

The production of greenhouse gasemissions generated by aircraft exhaust, emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogenoxide (NOX) and water vapor will increase in proportion within the air transportationindustry.  As a result, NASAs Fundamental Aero Program has established goals to reducefuel burn in future aircraft, reduced fuel burn correlates to reduced CO2 and NOXemissions.  This task will help design combustor rig improvementsthat will enable jet engine manufacturers to test  low emission jet engine combustors. Methods to test alternative fuel technologies (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch) need to bedeveloped for aircraft applications to reduce emissions, improve performance, anddecrease the nation's dependence on oil.  The Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig located atthe NASA Glenn Research Center is a high-pressure, high-temperature combustion rig thatsimulates combustor inlet test conditions.  The Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rig isequipped to measure both gas emissions and perform nonintrusive laser diagnostic emissiontesting in a high pressure high temperature environment that mimics the conditions ofhigh pressure ratio jet engine combustor section.

Upgrades will increase the Advanced Subsonic Combustion Rigstesting capabilities to enable testing of jet engine combustors using both jet enginefuels and alternate fuels, separately or together.

A CPAF order is appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertain nature of theresearch/testing support activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.

Specific work tasks involve saw cutting and replacing portions of the concrete curb nearest the control tower, installing new bridge deck drains, placing elastomeric sealant in expansion joints, and painting of the bridge. Painting work involves commercial blast cleaning of approximately 10% of the steel surfaces of the bridge (areas showing deterioration and corrosion), brush-off blast cleaning of the remaining 90% of the steel surfaces, priming of areas that received commercial blast cleaning, and finish coating of all steel surfaces. The new finish paint shall be aluminum paint. The bridge is currently coated with an aluminum top coat and primer. The Contractor shall assume that lead paint remains on the bridge from previous paintings, primarily in the primer coat. Serious fall hazards exist on this project and the Contractor shall take all necessary precautions and employ fall hazard protections.
