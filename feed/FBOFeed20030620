<DESC>The US Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, other Department of Defense organizations, and other Government organizations, invites proposals for research in the area of human and information system interaction infrastructure. With a vision of ANYTIME-ANYWHERE information system resource accessibility, this invitation includes research in the areas of language dependent and independent communications between humans and information systems; processing by information systems of human originated inputs and queries; agent-based or other intelligent information query formation and processing; intelligent and rapid, domain dependent and independent information detection, extraction, and retrieval; and intelligent and dynamic information summarization and presentation. Also included in this request is research in the areas of information system infrastructure including networking technologies and architectures that support interaction between humans and information systems as well as collaboration applications. This research includes secure networking, network attack recognition and identification, and the ability to continue operations in the presence of a successful attack. Research proposals are also invited in the areas of human-information system interaction in distributed computing environments, including command system applications; innovative technology and component integration and corresponding conceptual design and documentation, including multimedia representations; technology transition; and reference prototype implementations. Research proposals in the areas of perception and visualization are also encouraged. Offerors are invited to submit white papers that will be reviewed to identify valuable research for further consideration.  If a proposed area of research and the accompanying research approach is considered potentially valuable, and within funding limits, a full proposal will then be requested. Instructions for the preparation and submission of full proposals will be provided with that request.   A web site has been established which contains the text of this BAA, and instructions for submission of a white paper.  All answers to questions and any additional information pertaining to this BAA will be posted on this web site as available. It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor this web site for any additional information.   The web site address is <a href=http://www.nbc.gov/hisii.cfm>http://www.nbc.gov/hisii.cfm</a>. White papers are limited to three pages, including all figures, tables, attachments and the estimated annual schedule and cost (rough order of magnitude). Reviewers will not e-mail software or simulations in the conduct of white paper reviews. However, web sites containing concise simulations or other information not readily represented in the static format of a document may be hyperlinked from the white paper. Innovative approaches to information presentation are encouraged. White papers shall include the name, address, voice phone number, facsimile number, and email address of the proposing organization and the principal point of contact. The white paper shall also include the names of other organizations participating as part of the research team.  For readability, most text based information should be in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial, though other fonts and sizes may be utilized as necessary in tables, headings, drawings, other art, and etc. White papers shall be produced using Microsoft Word, Excel and/or Power Point; or may be submitted as Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) files. NBC Southwest Branch will acknowledge receipt of white papers. Offerors will subsequently be notified only if a full proposal is desired. No detailed review or debriefing of white papers will be provided. All white papers and proposals shall be UNCLASSIFIED.  The government?s preference is to obtain unlimited rights (as defined by FAR 52.227-14 ?Rights in Data ? General?) to the results and products of this research. Any proposed research that will restrict the government?s rights, and the degree to which those rights will be restricted, shall be clearly delineated in the white paper.  Evaluation of white papers and full proposals will be performed utilizing the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 1) Overall scientific and technical merit;  2) Potential contribution to the various Defense Department and other Government human and information system interaction research efforts as delineated above; 3) Capabilities and related experience of the offeror;  4) Plans and capabilities for technology transformation and transition; and 5) Cost realism. Full proposals will be considered to be either selectable or non-selectable based on their evaluation in accordance with the criteria herein.  Offerors will be promptly notified of the evaluation results. Only selectable proposals will be considered for funding.  Not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability, overall scientific and technical merit, and potential contribution to the Defense Department mission.  Proposals may be considered for funding for a period of up to one year from notification of selectability.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors. Prior to submittal of white papers, technical inquiries can be made to: Roy L. Peters NBC/DOI P.O. Box 12924 Fort Huachuca, AZ 85670-2924 telephone: (520)538-0409 Email:  <A href=mailto:Roy_L_Peters@nbc.gov>Roy_L_Peters@nbc.gov</A> Responses to inquiries will be by email or telephone. This BAA will remain open for submission of white papers until 30 June 2005. It is anticipated that any awards will be for from one to three years and for less than $5,000,000 overall. White papers should be structured accordingly. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the government?s needs may submit a white paper proposal that shall be considered.  Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside to HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among these entities.  Questions of a contractual nature should be directed to the Contract Specialist: Veronica Romero (subject to change) P.O.

The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American  Industry Classification System Code is 334510 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The MRI probes are required to replace and act as a back up coil for the existing Bruker Biospin instrument currently located within the NIH Mouse Imaging Facility.  There are a number of on going projects that are time sensitive and if one or more old probes breaks, they will impact past, present, and future research.  The probes are needed because  the current Bruker instrument is specialized and is uniquely designed to perform MRI scans of rat and mouse body and also individual organs of interest.  The Bruker probes are also identical to the old Bruker probes that exist and therefore, give identical results for all ongoing studies.  Specifications: 35mm i.d. 59 mm long mouse body coil (300MHz). 72 mm i.d. 112mm long rat body coil (300MHz). 20 mm surface coil for mouse / rat brain and other selective organs (300 MHz).

The supplies and services herein are bing procured with the simplified acquisition procedures as defined in FAR Part 13.  The North American Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  NINDS requires the purchase of an MRI safe ventilator for two (2) purposes.  First concern is for safety.  The NINDS NMRF requires a ventilator that can be used in a magnetic environment.  The NMRF currently has an anesthesia machine, which was not designed to be used in a room with a strong magnetic field.  It could potentially harm personnel or research animals if not used properly.  NINDS wishes to replace this piece of equipment with a ventilator that will eliminate the possibility of injury.  The second benefit of this ventilator is the increased image quality, which shall benefit our research experiments.  Datex-Ohmeda Inc., is the only source known to NINDS that is the sole manufacturer that can produce a unique MRI compatible ventilation system that can be used in any of the five (5) MRI units located in the In Vivo NMR Research Facility.  In addition, it does not require installation of separate poser kits for each magnet area thru making it a portable unit.  The portable system does not require any additional installation fees or downtime, and can meet the needs of NINDS NMRF.  The portability of the Datex-Ohmeda system shall provide the researcher unlimited flexibility with anesthesia ventilation concerns.  This is not a notice for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement of any other  furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.

The contractor(s) must be able to provide a wide array of legal services.  Although it is not possible to predict all areas in which services will be needed, the PBGC anticipates that it may seek assistance of outside counsel in the following areas: complex civil litigation; bankruptcy and reorganization claims litigation (including the priority and valuation of PBGC claims in bankruptcy); complex business transactions and transactional matters relating to reorganization; real estate matters and litigation; security arrangements; Uniform Commercial Code matters; employment law; administrative law; and complex trial. The litigation and negotiations may be lengthy and complex in nature.  Contractors must be available to commence work on very short notice.  Therefore, at a minimum, prospective contractors must have a Martindale-Hubbell "AV rating" for their law firm sufficient to meet the PBGC's needs on short notice.

The resultant contract will be entitled “FAUNA: Wildlife Information Gathering” for the USDA Forest Service, Region One. 

BACKGROUND: The Fauna Module of the USDA Forest Service Natural Resource Information System (NRIS) for Terrestrial Wildlife Management is one of six NRIS components designed to implement a corporate approach to the management of natural resource information for the National Forest system. Additional information on the Fauna Module is available from www.fs.fed.us/emc/nris/fauna.  The Fauna module is comprised of a distributed database structure with ORACLE (tabular) and geographic information system (GIS) (spatial) components; Worldwide Web-based tools for accessing data from other sources and providing access to Fauna module data; and a set of applications designed for resource managers and specialists at district, forest, and regional levels.  Targeted users are wildlife biologists, ecologists, and other resource specialists involved in district and forest planning, inventory, monitoring, effects analysis, and implementation; species conservation and recovery strategies, and large scale ecosystem assessments.  Fauna operates agency-wide on the IBM Windows PC platforms with both tabular and graphical displays and manipulation of information.  

PURPOSE: The purpose of this acquisition is to gather, at the USDA Forest Service, Forest and District level, all non-electronic information on the species of concern.  During two meetings, the Forest and Planning Wildlife Biologists identified approximately 45 species of concern for inclusion in this contract and they are further identified in the RFQ.   

STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor shall provide all services, supplies, materials, equipment, and items necessary to (a) gather observation information from notes, on cards, or in other forms, some observations dating from the1950s, (b) review the gathered observation for validity, (c) enter these observations into a windows based database like ACCESS, (d) ensure that all Fauna Module fields are considered for inclusion, and (e) prepare a summary final report for improvement of the process.  To perform this contract, the winning Contractor shall perform the following major Tasks.  TASK I. The Contractor shall visit, in person, each Forest/District to gather observation information for the designated species of concern as listed in the Species of Concern Technical Exhibit in the Request for proposals.

The Contractor shall prepare and submit a summary final report to provide insights into this process for improvement. 

DELIVERABLE REQUIREMENTS (DR):  DRI. The Contractor shall submit the deliverables to meet national standards as further identified in the solicitation. DR II. The Contractor shall ensure the deliverables are compatible in format with the NRIS FAUNA Module to any database structure differences with the Montana Natural Heritage Program and Idaho Conservation Data Center for Rare Species so data can be shared with ease.  DR III.  The Contractor shall prepare and submit a summary final report and ten copies (on compact disk) such that the Regional Office and each Forest will receive a copy.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, plans to procure on a sole source basis with Ms. Felicia Mann. Germantown, MD 20876, to process 60 fresh lung cancer tumor tissue samples isolate total RNA and prepare target probes for GeneChip hybridization.  DCEG has a large case-control study of lung cancer underway in Milan, Italy, which may eventually have over 2000 participants.  To date 800 lung cancer cases have enrolled and the available cases have provided as many as 10 tissue specimens (each) from over 150 surgically treated individuals.  This study is unique in that at the time of surgical operation fresh frozen tumor tissue was collected.  Ms. Mann has successfully completed work with precisely this type of tissue, trained under the direction of Dr. Jin Jen (a leader in the investigation of the molecular genetics of lung cancer, who has produced pioneering work using this approach in lung cancer). She has experience in production level laboratory research, equipment manipulation and computer based data management systems and essential additional training in immunohistochemistry staining, human tissue processing and in related molecular biology projects.  Due to the unique nature of these one-of-a-kind specimens and the technically demanding nature of this study only Ms. Mann can satisfy programs requirement.  This procurement is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, showing they have completed similar work involving isolation of total RNA and preparation of target probes on fresh frozen lung cancer it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI staff to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 2:00 p.m. EDT, on June 26, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NAICS 541990

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Mary E. Coleman Contract Specialist 7037871353     Mary.Coleman@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks is seeking potential contractors to provide a solution which will allow the processing of invoices electronically, hereinafter referred to as "e-invoicing".  The e-invoicing shall be posted and processed through GovWorks' Business Information System (BIS), and ABACIS, our financial accounting system.  GovWorks currently processes some 2,200 invoices per month for approximately 500 vendors.  This is a labor and paper intensive environment.  GovWorks' invoice approval process involves the attention and participation of several different entities.  These entities include the vendor, procurement assistants, the COTR, the CO and the Finance department for disbursement of payments.  In order to implement a successful e-invoicing solution, the system must provide 24 hour x 7 day accessibility to all entities involved.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties are responsible for obtaining their own copy of the solicitation package via http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  This competitive process will be simplified in order to facilitate the acquisition process and prevent undue administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government.  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement which is due no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, Tuesday, July 8,  2003.  The Government will review the experience and capability of your organization and proposed project team as demonstrated by the information supplied in this submittal.  All Offerors must submit an electronic copy in Microsoft Word plus one (1) original hard copy to the Contracting Officer at the address specified in this notice.  Please note:  It is your responsibility to ensure that your submission (electronic and/or hard copy) is received by the person specified herein, by the required due date.  Each Capabilities Statement received will be evaluated according to the criteria shown below.  The evaluation criteria shown below (1 though 4) are roughly equal to each other.  (1) your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) with their qualifications and specific experience within the electronic invoicing environment; (2) your organizational experience within the electronic invoicing environment; and (3) specific references (including contract number &  project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number, size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence, adherence to schedules and budgets) for previous  related work within the electronic invoicing environment that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years.  (4) , effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and service rendered.)  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be invited to continue in this acquisition process and requested to submit a proposal and will be provided any additional instructions. Please note in accordance with FAR Part 12.208, "Agencies shall use firm-fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment for the acquisition of commercial items".  Therefore the Government anticipates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this acquisition.

The main organization currently  housed in this facility is the military personnel office.   Since this office will remain in operation during  construction, minimizing the impact to this mission will be  a critical concern.  The extremely high level of visibility  of this project will result in an unusually high level of  scrutiny by all levels of WPAFB leadership.  The building  currently occupied by the civilian personnel office is  scheduled for demolition.  This major renovation will  involve the complex management of numerous disciplines  (inlcuding the installation of sytems furniture), working  simultaneously, and critical phasing and scheduling  requirements.  The contractor must have extensive  experience in the management of large multi-disciplined  projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   Failure to supervise and coordinate the different trades  required to provide a quality and timely product will not  be acceptable as it would result in the disruption of the  long range plans for the using organization.

The item number was pulled from Office Depot's website as a reference, but it is apparently not the actual Global number, however the chair can be viewed there.  2) Will installation be required? No, the FOB point is destination and includes shipping only. Base personell will take care of the installation. 3) Do the chairs need to be delivered in one shipment? Preferably yes, however, multiple shipments can be accepted as long as 1000 chairs reach the destination within 30 days.

<CONTACT>Kelly Rima, Purchasing Agent, Phone 303-497-3779, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov
<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a benchtop (EDXRF) Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence System.  The following technical specifications are necessary to meet out program needs:
1)	DETECTOR:  Si PIN or better(energy resolution of at least 260eV) with a collection area of at least 10 mm squared.  The detector must be electrically cooled (no liquid nitrogen cooling).  The window on the detector must provide for analysis of elements at least as light as sodium.
2)	X-RAY SOURCE:  Adjustable excitation voltage of at least 10-35KV, Rh or W anode, at least 10 W tube power.  The excitation area must be smaller than 1 cm squared.
3)	SAMPLE HANDLIN:  Ability to easily handle standard 75 mm and 100 mm wafers.  Additionally it would be useful if samples as thick as 8 mm could be loaded for analysis.  The ability to evacuate the sample area is optional but considered a plus.
4)	PULSE PROCESSING, COMPUTER AND SOFTWARE:  The system must include pulse processing electronics and a data acquisition computer.  The computer must at a minimum control the data acquisition, collect spectra of fluorescent x-rays and perform standard compositional analyses.  In addition to determining composition of mixed samples, it would be very useful if the software could perform thin-film thickness analyses.
5)	PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:  It is preferable that the system fit on a desktop (less than 1 m wide by .75 m deep by .75 m high) although a floor standing unit (1 m wide by .75 m deep by 1.5 m high) is acceptable.  The system must operate using a standard 115V 20A circuit.
6)	PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS:  Because the performance of these systems depends greatly on the particular elements being studied, two example cases are specified.  The system must be able to reproducibly determine the thickness of both layers of a Mo/Cu bilayer on a Si wafer (Mo on the bottom nominal 60 nm thickness, Cu nominal 200 nm thickness) with an uncertainty of less than plus or minus 1 nm after appropriate calibration.  Additionally the system must be able to measure the Fe content in a 100 nm thick W film to better than 2 ppm with appropriate calibration.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  The proposed procurement is non-restrictive, but small businesses will receive preference.  Written quotes should address all of the technical specifications and will be received up to the close of business on July 10, 2003.  Selection will be based upon technical merit and price.  Any questions should be sent in writing to Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov.  FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.  Agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/CONOPS/#REFERENCE. Hard copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date July 14, 2003.
