Demonstrate production capability by providing a minimum of 120 production representative devices and present manufacturing data to verify production yields and confirm manufacturing capacity and maturity; 6.) Provide test data that demonstrates physical compatibility with the aircrew population for spectacle frame compatibility (form/fit/function) with the JHMCS ensemble; The device shall meet requirements contained in the ALEP Performance Specification which includes laser protection, optical qualities, visual performance, durability, and environmental specifications.<br />Current qualified source is: Teledyne Scientific &amp; Imaging.
<p>Proposed delivery is a minimum of 40 units per month and is to commence five months after receipt of modification. Proposed period of performance is 17 months after receipt of modification.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), DHHS/CDC/NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to ARC Weld, Inc. for Development and fabrication of a Collapsible Drill Steel Enclosure (CDSE).
<p>SCOPE OF WORK<br />The contractor shall provide a revised design for a CDSE. Interim deliverables for the contract shall be the following.<br />1. A conference call or presentation (at NIOSH preference) to NIOSH for discussion of the initial prototype design. This shall document progress to date. Engineering drawings and a parts list are required. A mock up of a prototype is preferable. NIOSH shall provide comments and further guidance to the vendor.<br />2. At each revision of the CDSE, three prototypes shall be provided to NIOSH for laboratory and field evaluation.<br />3. A final design shall be submitted to NIOSH via samples of the CDSE ready for field use, engineering drawings, and parts lists, including vendors.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements<br />Specific technical requirements include the following.<br />The current design includes a spring to hold the CDSE upright. This must be replaced with another system (e.g., pneumatic, hydraulic) that will allow the operator to raise the CDSE to full height as needed. This will facilitate easy insertion of the drill steel and eliminate the need for the hinge. The bellows material NIOSH currently uses as an acoustic barrier is not sufficiently rugged for long-term use underground. The vendor shall manufacture or procure a barrier material of adequate toughness to provide a reasonable life underground. Because this is the most likely source of mechanical failure of the CDSE, ensuring that the barrier material is simple and easy to replace is strongly suggested. In addition, a clear acoustic barrier material is preferred. The CDSE shall collapse to maximum of 12 inches in height. This facilitates easy installation of the drill steel or the roof bolt wrench. Because of the wide range of roof heights the CDSE may function in, extended heights of the CDSE may range from 12 to 48 inches.</p>
<p>Reporting Schedule<br />The initial conference call or presentation shall occur no more than 30 calendar days after the awarding of the contract.<br />The initial prototypes are to be provided to NIOSH no more than 45 calendar days after the awarding of the contract.<br />The final engineering drawings, field ready CDSEs and parts lists shall be delivered to NIOSH no more than 90 calendar days after the awarding of the contract.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property<br />1. An example of the current NIOSH design of a CDSE or engineering drawings.<br />2. A parts list.<br />3. A video illustrating its use.</p>
<p>Deliverables<br />A final design shall be submitted to NIOSH via samples of the CDSE ready for field use, engineering drawings, and parts lists, including vendors.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to GLORIA GRUBER, Purchasing Agent, Phone Number 412-386-4967, Fax 412-386-6843, E-Mail ggruber@cdc.gov, 00HCCMBD-2009-68848, Department of Health and Human Services, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch (Pittsburgh), Post Office Box 18070, Pittsburgh, PA, 15236-0070</p>

<DESC>In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009, Pub. L 111-5, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  IAW FAR 5.704, Publicizing - Preaward, the Government posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to existing Department of State task order SAQMMA07F2149 under Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract SAQMPD07D0095 with Worldwide Information Network Systems (WINS), 7404 Executive Place, Suite 400, Seabrook, MD  20706-6228.

The Project Description is as follows: The project shall provide O&M support and maintain the Department of State standard IT platform/infrastructure in support of both domestic and internationally based Department of State offices.  The Contractor will receive Thin Client, Citrix, and FilesX training at GITM facilities in Springfield, Virginia, and will provide Tier 2 O&M support.

The original order was awarded as a competitive task order in the 8(a) set-aside pool between the ten Department of State Hybrid Information Technology Services for State (HITSS) 8(a) contractors.   The rationale for using other than a fixed-price approach is that the level of effort for the required IT services depends on variables that were not known prior to task issuance and neither the Government nor the Contractor were able to estimate the extent or duration of work with any reasonable degree of confidence.  Because of the uncertainty of the work, a fixed price task order could not be reasonably negotiated and only a labor-hour contract could be reasonably awarded.

Total value of this labor-hour modification is $1,188,119.

<DESC>Recovery Option Exercise on Existing Contract
THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER THE REPLACEMENT LAMP MONITORING SYSTEM.    This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

To date only New Bedford Panoramics has successfully built a LMS which works on the ALS power lines.
Award:
The FAA will exercise an option under contract DTFAWA-05-C-00078 with NBP in the amount of $2,848,064 for the procurement and installation of the Replacement Lamp Monitoring System (RLMS) at ten (10) airport facilities across the nation, in order to monitor the ALSF-2 lighting systems consistently, reliably and continually.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking a contractor for the following: Charge for Redesign/Optimization of Ruminant Assay.

DESCRIPTION:  Contractor shall redesign and re-optimize the ruminant probes in an optimized multiplex 5-nuclease (Taqman style) probe format for use on the Cepheid SmartCycler, attempting to locate primers and probes within the existing primer/probe regions if practical.  What we require for the Contractor is as follows:

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
1) Contractor shall redesign and re-optimize the cattle probe in an optimized multiplex 5-nuclease (Taqman style) probe format for use on the Cepheid SmartCycler, attempting to locate primers and probes within the existing primer/probe regions if practical. 

2) Contractor shall incorporate an Internal Amplification Control (IAC) into the assay in an additional detection channel to control for the reporting of false NEGATIVE results. In its present form, the assay does not account for sample inhibitors that can cause a false negative result. An IAC always reports in samples that are truly negative. If the IAC does not report it indicates PCR inhibitors are present from the sample matrix, and thus helps preclude the reporting of a false negative result.

3) Contractor shall optimize the assay for production in a lyophilized bead format in Cepheid Dispensers, for use with Cepheid beaded mastermix reagents. Such a format will provide the greatest convenience, reproducibility, and ease of use for the end user.

4) FDA will provide Contractor with all necessary control DNA materials and DNA sequence information required for development of the assays. FDA will provide Contractor with all primers and probes to be utilized for the assay development and bead manufacturing service, including up 2 separate batches of probes for each assay target, 2 batches of probe for the IAC target (most likely only 1 will be required), and 2 primer sets for each probe tested. Total = up to 8 Taqman probes and 32 primers.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-33.  The associated NAICS code is 541711 and small business size standard is $500.0 Million.  

Period of Performance: Six months for the time of the award

<DESC>The U.S.D.A. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have worked cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) since 1998 to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA), including eight butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morands checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  These were identified as priority in the CA based on a limited number of locations where the butterflies are currently known to occur.  Autecology studies are imperative to determine why the ranges of these four species are restricted and help provide detailed information necessary to restore and improve butterfly habitat and range.  Given the demand to provide recreation and other uses on the Spring Mountains NRA, there is an urgent need to understand the basic biology and develop a management strategy for these four butterfly species to appropriately inform decision making.  

The Solicitation will be posted at this website on or about 10/25/2008.  If there is a "Pre-Proposal" conference/site walk offered, the details will be in the solicitation, once published.  The technical point of contact is Amy Meketi, (702) 515-5421.  All questions should be submitted in writing via FAX to Contracting Officer at (702) 839-5599 or E-mail at sroehr@fs.fed.us so that we have a record of the question, and can make a determination if the answer needs to be published in the form of a solicitation amendment.

<SUBJECT>Gene-environment interactions and risk factors for rare lymphoma subtypes and pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph)
<SOLNBR>NCI-90093-AV
<RESPDATE>051809
<CONTACT>Ashley L. Virts, Email virtsa@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Gene-environment interactions and risk factors for rare lymphoma subtypes and pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph)
with Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Department of Health Science Research, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905-0002.

The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541711 the business size standard is 500 employees.

Period of Performance is twelve months from the date of award.

The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) within the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently conducting studies to understand the relationship between environmental and genetic factors and risk of NHL and its subtypes. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is composed of many closely-related, yet heterogeneous, diseases characterized by the malignant transformation of lymphoid cells but with distinctive morphologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. The strongest and most consistently observed risk factor for NHL is severe immunodeficiency, but the etiologies of most lymphomas remain unknown. InterLymph was formed in 2001 to undertake collaborative epidemiologic research to help discover the causes of NHL.

Recent results from individual studies participating in the InterLymph Consortium have    further suggested intriguing gene-environment interactions (e.g., autoimmune conditions, obesity, sun exposure, hepatitis C and atopy with TNF/IL 10 genotypes, and cigarette smoking with NAT1/2 phenotypes). However, none of the individually reported gene- environment interactions have sufficient power to robustly demonstrate such interactions statistically. In addition, data are lacking regarding potential specificity of the reported gene-environment interactions by NHL subtype. A unique opportunity therefore exists to examine pooled analyses within the International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium (InterLymph).

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain the services of a contractor experienced in collaborating with InterLymph, as well as the conduct of pooled epidemiologic studies. Specifically, the contractor shall: (i) coordinate the request and receipt of key variables (e g., environmental and genetic factors, and lymphoma subtype definitions) from all participating InterLymph studies; (ii) harmonize key variables across all studies with detailed documentation regarding data cleaning and translation; and (iii) create pooled datasets for specific InterLymph analyses. In addition, because of the complexity of the consortial collaboration, the Data Coordinating Center at the Mayo Clinic has a history of effective, ethical and responsible collaborations with multiple institutions as well as high-quality computing, statistical and informatics resources including dedicated time of experienced data manager and analysts to standardize data and perform basic data analyses. Most importantly, the Mayo Clinic houses computing resources, server space, IT support and an encrypted contributor web-site for a data dictionary, documentation for variable creation, description of database software, specific statistical approaches and other key information needed to analyze the allotted information in the InterLymph study.  Because the Mayo Clinic is the only Data Coordinating Center for InterLymph, it is essential that they perform the requested services.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on May 18, 2009. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Ashley Virts: virtsa@mail.nih.gov. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-90093-AV on all correspondence.

The earthen ditch plugs consist of plugging existing drainage ditches that are 4 to 5 feet deep and about 18 feet wide. These drainage ditches are typically dry during the summer months.  The borrow material shall be hauled from the designated borrow area, which is approximately 1000 feet from the farthest ditch plug.  

The one sheet pile ditch plug consists of installing approximately 48 lineal feet of steel
sheet pile with a 28 weir notch. This plug is located in a larger existing drainage ditch
that typically has standing water in it.  A sheet pile cap is required.  Rock riprap shall be
placed on the downstream side of the structure.

Performance time is estimated to be 21 days.

The intent of this project is to replace the existing HVAC system at building 900.  Work includes but is not limited to the following; Remove the chiller system and two air-handling units and their associated equipment, split systems, and the roof top units (RTU) for comfort air and their associated equipment.  Provide new chiller system with variable air volume (VAV) and Direct Digital Control (DDC) for all comfort air areas, except computer test bed and SCIF areas.
The building has three (3) different HVAC areas; the personnel areas; the computer test bed areas; and the SCIF area(s).  The HVAC in computer test bed and SCIF areas are still relatively new and sufficient.  The 100-ton water chiller provides chilled water for the HVAC in the personnel areas was installed in 1979. It's very old and insufficient. The Government has attempted to resolve the problem by installing many roof top units and split systems.  The systems, however, are prone to HVAC failures.

<DESC>FEDBIZOPS Synopsis
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is seeking a contractor to provide Technical, Analytical and Regulatory Support for the Office of Water, (OW), Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Water Security Division (WSD).  With the nation under continuing threat from those who seek to harm it, EPA has the important responsibility of protecting the environment from terrorist acts.   In addition, the Water Security Division has responsibilities of an ?all hazards? approach to protecting the nation?s water supply in the instance of natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, climate changes, chemical security issues, and pandemic illnesses.  Guidance concerning responsibilities and programmatic requirements of the WSD is available via the web at www.epa.gov/watersecurity. The contract resulting from this solicitation will provide mission critical support for homeland security issues with a water sector emphasis.
The successful contractor shall provide all necessary labor, materials, services, equipment and facilities to support the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Services to be performed are intended to support the protection of critical infrastructure for the water sector, and also include tasks related to research, development, testing, training, and communication and/or implementation of enhanced methods for detection, treatment, and containment of biological and chemical contaminants of concern and the delivery of a safe water supply to the nation.  Water sector security areas to be addressed by the contract include requirements related to 1) critical infrastructure protection; 2) national preparedness, response, and recovery; and 3) Agency communication, information, and program management efforts.   
Services to be performed under this contract include technical, engineering, and scientific efforts; support for contamination warning system initiatives; emergency response and threat identification planning and response methods; method and guidance development; preparedness initiatives related to laboratory capability and capacity; data compilation, review, and management; regulation development; communication and coordination efforts with sector strategic partners; strategic planning and management support, including cost/benefit analysis, and risk assessment.  
Services to be performed also include program evaluation, and economic impact; consequence analysis initiatives; information technology initiatives, including information protection efforts; vulnerability assessment compilation and maintenance efforts; tool development and support; meeting and facilitation support; and training, outreach, peer review, and logistical efforts; support for emerging ?all hazards? concerns, including chemical security, pandemic illness, and climate change impacts.  The successful contractor shall also have experience designing and conducting training, and demonstrate the ability to support application of those skills to the water and emergency response sectors. 
The successful contractor is responsible for having in place the appropriate facility clearance (as indicated on the applicable DD Form 254 ? Dept. of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification) at the time of proposal submission.   Clearances for individual personnel in disciplines required to perform the effort shall be in place within 30 days of contract award.  The successful contractor shall have an established plan in place to coordinate appropriate laboratory services when necessary, accessing facilities, equipment, and scientific expertise needed, but no in-house laboratory facility is required.
This is a follow on requirement to support the mission of the Water Security Division, but does include new task areas in the Performance Work Statement.  The current contractor supporting this requirement is CSC Corp. under Contract EP-C-05-045.  The new contract is anticipated to be a CPFF, Level of Effort, term contract and will have a base period with (4) twelve month option periods.  The base period and each option period will consist of approximately 50,000 direct labor hours for a base quantity, and another 150,000 of optional quantity available in each period, to provide flexibility should national events require it. Total maximum Level of Effort, if all quantity options are exercised, for the five years of anticipated performance is estimated at 1,000,000 direct labor hours.  Anticipated award date for this contract is July 1, 2010.					Due to the size of the requirement, the RFP shall be conducted using FULL and OPEN competition procedures.  Significant evaluation will be given to the use of socio-economic diversity by the offeror in its proposal.  The NAICS code for the effort is 541620.  Interested small, small disadvantaged, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, 8(a), and Woman Owned Small Businesses who would like to have their areas of expertise included on a source list attached to the Cincinnati website concerning this RFP should immediately submit the following information to the Contract Specialist: Name and address of company; specific contact within company including name, telephone, and e-mail address; company website address; short summary of expertise area within the projected scope of work (3 line maximum); socio-economic classification; and NAICS codes.  This information will be updated until two weeks before the proposals are due, to allow interested Primes the opportunity to review potential  team members.
Significant potential exists for an organizational conflict of interest under this procurement.  Therefore, it is anticipated to be in the best interest of the Government to exclude all of the following groups: (1) firms that sell commercial security systems; (2) firms that own or operate community water systems; (3) firms that own or operate contaminated waste disposal or chemical security technology firms, or (4) firms that have vested commercial interest in emerging decontamination technology.  This exclusion may change when the RFP is released.  
Also, the solicitation will include the clause entitled LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (LOFC) which states in part: "The contractor, during the life of this contract, will be ineligible to enter into business or financial relationships which would support or affect any efforts to contest, oppose, or influence the contents of regulations, policies, limitations, standards or criteria relating to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Water Act,  for which it has provided, is providing, or has work assignments to provide technical and administrative support under this contract, without prior written authorization from the EPA cognizant contracting officer."  Be advised, however, that the afore-mentioned limitations may change when the RFP is released.
Solicitation PR-CI-09-10342 will appear on the internet and it may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Net (www.epa.gov).  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to frequently check the FEDBizOpps or the EPA website address for updates or changes.  See Cincinnati website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd for posted draft Performance Work Statement, draft security related requirements, and the interested party source list for this requirement.  Be advised, Performance Work Statement changes are possible when final RFP is released.   The direct link URL for the RFP when issued is http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around May 27, 2009. No hard copies will be available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey has a requirement for technical Consulting Services for a three year study on the quantification of natural and anthropogenic impacts on ground-water and lake levels in East Central Florida and to develop empirical models using data mining techniques that include ANN models based on site specific data to be delivered to U.S. Geological Survey,  Orlando Florida.
Advanced Data Mining International, LLC is the only known source for this requirement.
Technical Background: An alternative to applying physics-based, mechanistic, models to riverine/estuarine systems to develop empirical models using data mining techniques, which include ANN models, based on site-specific data.  The emerging field of data mining addresses the issue of extracting information from large databases.  It is comprised of several technologies that include signal processing, advanced statistics, multi-dimensional visualization, machine learning and Chaos Theory.  Data mining can solve complex problems that are unsolvable by any other means.  A neutral work model is a flexible mathematical structure capable of describing complex non-linear relationships between the input variables that are typically found in natural systems.  
I. Historical data analysis
   1)  Exploratory data analysis via an expanded Microsoft Excel data-viewer application.   2)  Cluster analysis to identify relevant groupings of data that exhibit similar behavior.   3)   Local ANN models of select short-term and long-term time series.II. Regional data mining model    1)  Spatial interpolation of multiple ANN models for short-term time series (likely 1995-2007) to quantify regional         ground-water system behavior.   2)  Develop a Decision Support system (DSS) of the historical databases, ANN models, model controls, model          output, and streaming graphics.III. Comparison with physics-based, ground-water flow models    1)  Development and application of three-dimensional response surfaces for comparing physics-based,     ground-water flow models with system behavior inferred from historical data.
There are two option periods

Written justification must be provided if the minimum small business goals cannot be met. The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFAR 19.7, Appendix DD. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.

<DESC><p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background: The CDC's Coordinating Center for Environmental Health and Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Injury Response is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from all parties and qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541720. <br />Numerous research studies have shown a relationship between violence and alcohol consumption. For example, Greenfeld and Henneberg (2001) used the NCVS to show that 35% of victims of violent crime reported that they believed that their assailant had been using alcohol at the time of the event. These rates were much higher for intimate partner (63%) and family violence (51%). In addition, surveys of prison inmates and probationers showed a higher rate of self-reported alcohol use for violent offenders than for non-violent offenders.</p>
<p><br />While there is a strong documented association between alcohol use and violence, there is not strong evidence of a causal link between alcohol consumption and violence. According to Miczek, et al (1993) "whether or not alcohol... causes a certain individual to act aggressively ...depends on a host of interacting pharmacological, endocrinological, neurobiological, genetic, situational, environmental, social and cultural determinants." In other words, both violence and alcohol consumption may be correlated with other individual characteristics that increase the likelihood of both behaviors.</p>
<p><br />In order to avoid the confounding factors that influence both violence and alcohol consumption, some recent studies have instead estimated the relationship between violence and alcohol taxes. Since alcohol taxes in a locality are presumably unrelated to an individual's underlying propensity for violence, but will influence consumption by raising prices, a demonstrated negative effect of taxes on violence gives support to the notion that restricting consumption of alcohol will reduce violence rates. Markowitz (2005) shows a significant effect of beer taxes on reduced rates of assault, Markowitz (2000) shows a significant reduction of IPV directed against women, and Markowitz and Grossman (2000) show that increases in the beer tax may decrease the incidence of physical child abuse by mothers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;While these studies have shown a relationship between existing alcohol taxes and violence, the usefulness of these results in analyzing changes in alcohol policy is limited by two factors. First, alcohol taxes in the U.S. are very low and have been declining in real terms over time. Wagenaar (2000) shows that the tax on beer per 12 ounce "drink" ranged from 0.18 cents in Wyoming to 9.87 cents in Alabama. Since current taxes constitute such a small amount of the price of alcohol, substantial increases in alcohol taxes may lead to a different response in violent behavior than that observed in current studies. For that reason, it is important to measure the total cost of alcohol, and not just the taxes. The total price of alcohol for a given type of distilled liquor, wine and beer is available quarterly for over 200 metropolitan areas. Using this measure of price, which should still be unrelated to a persons underlying propensity to violence, should give a more accurate measure of the true effect of the cost of alcohol on violence.<br />The second factor limiting the analysis of alcohol policy and violence is that previous studies often do not address non-tax regulation of alcohol. In addition to alcohol taxes, many other state policies potentially effect alcohol consumption. For example, some states set lower blood alcohol levels for DUI arrests, and having varying penalties for convictions. Some states require "keg registration" so that if underage drinkers are found drinking from a keg, it can be traced to the purchaser. States also vary in the penalties for providing alcohol to minors. To date, we found no study that examines the impact of these policies on violence rates. While considerable information on violence and alcohol policy has already been collected and is publicly available, no published researched has examined the relationship between the two in the way that this study proposes.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: To assess the relationship between alcohol policies and violence. This will be done by conducting statistical analysis of previously collected national survey data and publicly available data on alcohol policy at the state level. Although the Government anticipates the NAICS code is 541720, it is subject to change pending the review of the responses from prospective offerors. The contractor would be responsible for furnishing all required personnel, consultants, materials, equipment and supplies to provide various work and services as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The contractor will assist CDC in exploring the relationship between alcohol policy and violence, including: developing a plan that outlines the information necessary to estimate the association between alcohol policy and violence; purchasing the alcohol price data <br />previously collected by the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) appropriate for the years to be studied; acquiring all survey data for the project; conducting all data analyses estimating the association between alcohol policy and various types of violence; and delivering to CDC final drafts of research papers suitable for submission to peer review journals.

Definition of Yoshon  winter crop reads as follow: 

In order to determine if a grain is yoshon or chodosh, it is necessary to know when the plants have taken root. If it took root before the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan, it is from the old crop and it is yoshon. If it took root on or after the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan, it is from the new crop and it is chodosh. Other crops are planted in the fall, lie dormant during the winter, finish growing in the spring and summer, and are harvested in the summer. These are known as winter crops. Since they are planted in the fall, they take root well before the 16th of Nissan and all winter crop is always yoshon by the time it is harvested. In the United States, spring crops are usually planted so late that the development of the plant roots does not take place until after the 16th of the Hebrew month of Nissan. Therefore, spring crops are almost always chodosh at the time of the summer harvest and are not permissible for consumption until after the following Passover (15th of the month of Nissan). Therefore, the only way to provide for strict adherence to the Biblical precept of yoshon, it is necessary to either use winter wheat or store spring wheat until after the following Passover.

<DESC>Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is composed of over 7000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes.  The most effective means to achieve this goal is for the AVS organization to sustain their fulfillment of the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 9001:2000 requirements.  Having completed one (1) three-year cycle of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete a recertification audit.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract for one base year, with two one year options.
This is a full and open competition.  All interested sources are referred to the attached SIR/RFO.  All responses to this SIR/RFO must reference the solicitation number:  DTFAWA-09-R-01489 and be submitted to the following address:

In 2000, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) initiated activities to evaluate the merits of creating an innovation information network and a subsequent investment funding mechanism to encourage and support the implementation of innovative technologies, products, and services within the public transit marketplace. As part of this previous effort, an FTA contractor analyzed the potential interest of the venture capital community in becoming a partner with FTA to provide funding for promising public transportation innovation.  Due to various circumstances, these activities where never fully developed.  Recently, however, there has been renewed interest in utilizing innovative solutions to meet current funding and technological challenges in the transit industry, provoking a need to revisit the feasibility of establishing a public-private venture capital fund.  This renewed interest is, in part, as a result of the experiences of other venture capital instruments that exist within the federal context coupled with the general acknowledgement of the role public transportation plays in livability and regional economic development. 

Objective

The goal of this assignment is to develop a final report which will adequately evaluate and describe the interest and requirements of establishing a public-private venture capital fund to promote the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to meet challenges the public transportation industry is currently facing.  This project will describe current levels of interests, evaluate and document past and current similar experiences, and recommend best practices for moving forward with the establishment of an investment communication network linking entrepreneurs, venture capital and the transit industry, and ultimately, a venture capital fund.

Results of this study will assist FTA in developing legislative language for Congress for the establishment of a public-private venture capital fund to support innovation within the transit industry for the ensuing authorization of the next transportation bill.

A total of five (5) tasks have been identified as important to effectively completing the work approved by FTA: 

Assess and identify the benefits and requirements for instituting a venture capital fund for the public transportation industry.  Analysis will include the value, need for, and advantages of such an undertaking to insure its alignment to the needs of the transit industry and the mission of FTA. Analyze and describe the legal and foundational issues and obstacles to creating a public-private venture capital fund for public transportation. Make recommendations for the best possible organizational structure for a public, transportation-related venture fund considering critical issues such as risk, capitalization, management expertise, commercial centricity, legal formation, and intellectual property.

1. Identify the impediments venture capital investments currently experience when evaluating public transportation for investment and the extent to which such investment may or may not be already occurring.  Evaluate and document the critical success factors needed to facilitate investment in commercial projects as related to the transit industry and public transportation technologies and services.

2. Analyze and document the recent and current experiences and lessons learned in other private and federally-funded venture capital funds related to innovation but not limited to the transportation sector.  Evaluate the development, management, and best practices of venture funds that have been implemented through federal and state mechanisms.  The following experiences, at a minimum and as appropriate, should be evaluated against the recommended best approach, provided through this study:

	Technological venture capital firms, including corporate venture capital firms,
	Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA),
	Advance Concept Technology Demonstrations (ACTD),
	Federally Funded R&D Centers (FDFRDC),
	In-Q-Tel,
	International venture capital funds
	Other pertinent federal and state venture capital examples.

3. Identify, define, and document key program requirements involved in developing a federal/private sector venture capital innovation fund.

4. Prepare an outline of the steps needed to design, develop and implement a public transportation innovation venture capital fund which would include the creation of a communication network that would connect the public transportation industry, venture capital community, and entrepreneurial interests and provide information to all parties to guide investment.

5. Deliver both a draft and final report on the analysis listed above with suggestions on implementation goals, future activities and potential best practices for moving forward.  Present this report and findings at a presentation to FTA Staff.

Note: The following skillset are required as a result of the sources sought: Financial Consulting, Analytical Skills, Management experience within a venture capital environment, commercialization of new technology, and preparing financial/analysis reports.  

Once again, this notice is being issued for market research purposes only. The Govt. will not be obligated in any way to the information received. It is soley within the discretion of the Govt. to request official quotes based on the responses received.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 

THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE.  THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  

The purpose of this SS is to IDENTIFY QUALIFIED SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Women-owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HuBZone) Small Business, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business (SDVOSB) that are interested in and capable of  performing the work described herein.  The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. 

The Behavioral Research Program (BRP), Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences,  National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking capability statements from all eligible Small Businesses as state above, under NAICS Code #541910 (Marketing Research and Public Opinion Polling) with a size standard $7,000,000 per annum. 

The NCI, BRP/HCIRB is seeking support in planning, conducting, and analyzing the administration of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 4).  To perform the requirements, the contractor must possess sufficient technical, scientific, and operational capabilities for engaging in national surveillance efforts.  

Summary of Project: The purpose of the ongoing survey is to assess trends in the publics use of health information in an environment of rapidly changing communication and informatics options, and to allow the NCI extramural community access to the data for conducting hypothesis-generating research into the relationship between health information, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.  

	Survey Design: The Contractor shall, in consultation with the NCI Project Officer, develop a Survey Design Plan for a national sampling frame for the American public that will result in approximately 14,000 interviews of adults aged 18 years or older.  

	Instrument Design: Using previous iterations of the HINTS questionnaire as a base, while anticipating some changes in content, the Contractor shall develop, revise, format, and finalize an instrument that is designed to elicit valid responses, based on discussions with the Project Officer.  The instrument will be designed as a series of topical modules that can be organized into a series of survey instruments that the majority of respondents can complete in 30 minutes or less, and that is appropriate for the selected mode(s) of administration.  The Contractor will be responsible for developing both a Spanish and an English language version of the instruments.  

	Preparation of Materials for OMB Clearance: The Contractor, in consultation with the Project Officer, shall develop and then produce the required paper copies, as well as electronic copies, of all necessary documentation to be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for administrative clearance of HINTS 4 data collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

	Interviewer Hiring and Training: If the proposed survey design involves the use of telephone interviewers, the Contractor shall provide the services of a sufficient number of trained interviewers and other necessary personnel to complete the required number of interviews, and other data collection efforts, within the specified time frame.  

	Data Collection Procedures: The Contractor shall make use of procedures that are agreed upon by the Contractor Project Director and the NCI Project Officer to constitute best practices in the conduct of sample surveys. NCI recognizes that response rates to surveys are declining, so the Contractor is encouraged to consider any and all mechanisms, including notification letters, monetary reimbursement or other incentives, or alternative modes of data collection (e.g., mixed mode interviews involving the combination of telephone interviews with mail or Internet surveys) to obtain an acceptable response rate.  

	Data Management: The Contractor shall develop and implement a system to be used to code, edit, clean, and verify and store data as they are collected.  Monthly progress reports shall include updates and evaluations of the survey operation, development of the analytical plan, and complete tabular summaries of the interview data as appropriate. At the end of data collection, the Contractor shall provide the NCI a clean file containing data from the interviews and the necessary weighting vectors to enable analyses of data from complex sample surveys. With the final data file, the Contractor shall also supply a data kit containing hardcopy and electronic documentation that includes: a list of variables, codes, coding rules, edit specifications, edit flags, notes describing any problems with data, and a data dictionary.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice<br />RFP Number: HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-09-008
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: Longevity combined with good health and functioning at the end of life is the goal of most individuals. Finding ways of promoting this condition is an important goal of National Institute on Aging (NIA). Although research has been done on the correlates of long life and functional decline, we still know relatively little about why certain individuals live in excellent health into their 80's while others fail much sooner. In other words, how factors related to physiology and pathology affect longevity and healthy aging is not clear. It may be hypothesized that in older persons who escape diseases and disability, homeostatic mechanisms (integrity of anti-oxidant mechanisms, low level of oxidative damage to macromolecules, low inflammation, unimpaired autonomic reflexes, normal hormone levels etc.) should be relatively intact, with little accumulated damage. Understanding these mechanisms may open new opportunities of disability prevention.</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, NIA intends to include in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA), its longest study on aging, 500 new participants older than 80 years and in very good health and functional status. This new extension of the BLSA has been named the "Insight into the Determination of Exceptional Aging and Longevity" or IDEAL study. Including these new individuals, the BLSA will be able to utilize fully the extensive set of measures that have been recently introduced in the study for pursuing the original "mission" of the BLSA which is the study of healthy aging, independent of the effect of disease.</p>
<p>The NIA plans to enroll in the BLSA individuals who have already reached the goal of healthy longevity (IDEAL cohort) and to compare them with current BLSA participants who were no longer healthy or fully functional when they reached the age of 80 years old. As it is customary in the BLSA, we plan to follow this IDEAL cohort for life with yearly visits. The principal aim of this study is to identify factors and characteristics that distinguish individuals eligible for the IDEAL cohort from those who are not. In the current BLSA, an extraordinarily wide range of information is collected on biomarkers, physiological measures, behavioral and environmental risk factors and functional and disease-related outcomes. The NIA plans to collect the same information in the newly enrolled IDEAL cohort and to compare the two groups (IDEAL cohort and the BLSA) to identify factors that discriminate between those individuals who age successfully and those who do not. The second aim is to identify physiological, environmental and behavioral characteristics that are risk factors for "losing the healthy aging condition" over several years or longer. The NIA suggests that the mechanisms of extreme longevity are probably different from those associated with delay or escape from disease and disability.</p>
<p>It can be conservatively estimated that approximately 1% of individuals 80 years or older in the population are eligible for the IDEAL study. The catchment area identified for the BLSA IDEAL project is 150 miles around Baltimore. This is a highly populated area, with more than 8 million people living in the Baltimore-Washington area and approximately another 7 million people living in the rest of the large catchments area. Since the percentage of those 80+ in the population is approximately 4.0%, there are approximately 600,000 80+ individuals, and it can be estimated that 6,000 of them would be eligible for the IDEAL Study.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: This contract provides for the recruitment and screening of individuals for eligibility for the IDEAL Study from the Baltimore-Washington area (in a catchment area of 150 miles around Baltimore, Maryland). Eligible individuals will be considered those 80 years or older who meet the current BLSA inclusion criteria for healthy aging. The contract provides advertising and recruitment strategies aimed at reaching the most individuals possible in order to meet enrollment goals. In addition, the contract shall provide two stages of screening of potential participants. The first stage shall be a telephone interview and the second stage shall consist of in person visits with all individuals who meet the screening criteria in Stage One. The Contractor shall develop, maintain and release to the NIA, a database of information collected from screened individuals.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall design and implement a recruitment plan that includes multiple, parallel strategies on order to successfully reach potential participants for the IDEAL Study, with particular attention to the recruitment of minorities.

C with a resolution of 0.05C<br />-on-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings and release date <br />-light level measured as irradiance at a wavelength of 550nm, measurable from 5 x 10-12W.cm2 to 5 x 10-2W.cm2 in logarithmic units; longitude accuracy up to 0.5 degrees<br />-fully controllable and upgradeable onboard software; all parameters are user-programmable<br />-corrodible link to tether that releases the tag when either the user-programmed release date is reached or the -pre-mature release criteria are met.<br />-pre-mature release features: <br />-(1) RD-1500 to sever tether at depth of approximately 1500 m<br />-(2) user-programmable software to release tag from tether (via corrodible link) when tag has been at a nearly constant depth over a period of time (programmable threshold duration) and with a variance set by the user<br />-transmission at pop-up to ARGOS satellite with repetition rates of 44-64 (user programmable) seconds of frequency tables of depth distribution and temperature distribution, depth-temperature profiles, light level and locational data, and tag status data for each sampling interval specified by the user<br />-transmisson to include checksum error testing<br />-priority transmission of detailed data corresponding to the 15 days prior to release of tag, if pre-mature release criteria met<br />-user-controllable start up of tag without computer link, once the tag has been programmed by the user<br />-user programmable depth to trigger initialization of the software for the pre-release criteria.</p>
<p>These specifications are essential to ensure the compatibility of results with earlier results of the same study; the government has since deployed 47 such tags in a post-hooking mortality study for ESA-protected loggerhead sea turtles. Wildlife Computers is the only U.S. supplier that has popup satellite archival tags with operational protocols that ensure that even if the turtle are put on dies, that scientists will get back the data transmitted through the ARGOS satellite system. These protocols include a mechanical failsafe system that releases the tag prior to the popup date if the turtle sinks past 1,500 m. Software that allows researchers to program the tag to release prior to its programmed date if the animal maintains a specified depth range for a particular time period. They also can be programmed to transmit intermittently while still attached to the turtle to provide data critical to using known-fate mark-recapture analysis methods.</p>
<p>To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy or exceed the Government's needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this supply previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this supply.

<p>Description:<br />This is a Source Sought Synopsis only. The purpose of this synopsis is to obtain capabilities information from all size and types of firms to determine the degree of competition. Information received will be used to make a determination regarding the use of full and open competition or to set aside the procurement. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Requirements:<br />Government has a need to implement the recovery of white abalone, a species listed by the National Marine Fisheries Service as federally endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2001. Contract funds must go to an ESA permitted entity that can maintain white abalone brood stock and captive raised animals in a healthy and safe environment. Crucial elements for recovering endangered white abalone are: (1) developing the best methods for achieving reproduction in a captive setting; (2) ensuring the animals remain disease free in the laboratory and in nature once out-planted; (3) examining the growth and survival of young life stages in a laboratory and natural setting; (4) and initiating restoration of natural populations.</p>
<p>As required by the ESA, a recovery plan, which outlines the actions that must be taken in order to recover the species, was developed and finalized in the fall of 2008. One of the required actions is to establish methods for captively propagating white abalone so that laboratory generated animals may be used to enhance and restore natural populations until they have met particular criteria (e.g., achieving certain densities, size ranges, etc.). This recovery action must be carried out at an ESA permitted facility where staff with expertise in marine invertebrate reproductive biology, pathology and ecology exists.</p>
<p>Description of Work and Services</p>
<p>Task 1. White abalone will be maintained in a healthy and safe environment where their reproductive health and readiness will be monitored and spawning of wild-caught and laboratory-reared white abalone will be conducted.</p>
<p>Task 2. The basic reproductive and endocrinology of white abalone will be studied in order to develop the best methods for spawning them in a captive setting. Techniques for cryopreserving sperm, eggs, and embryos will also be investigated.</p>
<p>Task 3. Methods for producing disease-free animals in a captive setting will be developed and the best methods for reducing susceptibility of captive-reared white abalone to disease will be investigated.</p>
<p>Task 4. The best methods for maximizing larval survival once larvae are out-planted will be developed by investigating: 1) larval survival and behavior in relation to water temperature, salinity and CO2 concentrations within the water column, and 2) larval and juvenile growth and morphological progression in relation to their diet. Travel to Southern California will be required for this task.</p>
<p>Work will be performed under task orders issued from a IDIQ (Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity) contract. There will be a base year and two option years.</p>
<p>Interested parties should submit: 1) a brief description of their capability to provide the required items; 2) evidence of experience and past performance (including a contact name and telephone number); 3) intention to submit a proposal as a prime contractor, and; 4) business company size, point of contact and DUNS number. The business size shall include any applicable preference program (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned, Small Business, etc.)</p>
<p>For the purposes of this requirement, the NAICS size standard for small business is $7,000,000.00. Said dollar amount is an average of three years of revenue.</p>
<p>Questions concerning this notice shall be emailed to john.d.cooley@noaa.gov Responses shall be submitted via email or facsimile at 206-527-7148 by COB May 22, 2009, Pacific Daylight Time. This notice is for informational and market research purposes only. Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.</p>

This request is to find innovative ways of lining a potable water line with minimal or no resource damage.    Approximately 4,000 linear feet of this main distribution line is buried in fragile alpine backcountry.    The existing potable water line is 6-inch cement-lined cast steel, installed in 1984. The numerous cracks or breaks in the pipe are a serious health concern because of possible infiltration by bacteria. The cement causes the pH to rise and, therefore, makes the chlorine used to treat the water less effective. The potable water system for the Sunrise area is supplied from a dammed lake at elevation 6700 feet. The lake is fed by melted snow.This request is to find innovative ways of lining the potable water line with minimal resource damage.   Please provide information of how the company would line the potable water line that would stop the leaks, with minimal or no resource damage,  increase the effectiveness of chlorine, providing a better, more reliable water supply to the visitor and employees. The Government will use responses to this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<SOLNBR>SECHQ1-09-0002
<RESPDATE>060509
<CONTACT>Wanda J. Armwood, Contracting Officer, Phone 2025518561, Email armwoodw@sec.gov
<DESC>This is not a solicitation. This sources sought notice is for informational and planning purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Respondents shall be responsible for all costs associated with the information submitted in response to this notice. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is in the process of determining its acquisition strategy to obtain maintenance services for the series of data dictionaries, or taxonomies, based on the eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) which is used in various SEC programs. A listing of the currently supported XBRL data dictionaries can be found at http://sec.gov/info/edgar/edgartaxonomies.shtml.

The SEC wants these data dictionaries to remain current and accurate as their use is required under Commission releases 33-9002 Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting and 33-9006 Interactive Data for Mutual Fund Risk/Return Summary. The data dictionaries will need to be updated to reflect changes in accounting standards, SEC rules, the core XBRL technologies and best practices, and to reflect improvements based on feedback from their initial implementation. 

In order to successfully meet the SECs needs, respondents will need to demonstrate expertise in XBRL technology. In particular, a detailed understanding of and experience with the XBRL specification, recommendations and candidate recommendations, taxonomy development architectures and best practices, and taxonomy development and maintenance software are critical. Respondents will also need to demonstrate a comprehensive, detailed understanding of the subject matter being represented in the data dictionaries. The SEC requires that the data dictionaries be developed and maintained in a manner that facilitates widespread market involvement and feedback that includes, but is not limited to: investors, analysts, public companies, mutual funds, technology and software providers, accounting firms, industry trade groups and academia.

The SEC also requires that the taxonomies developed and maintained meet the following criteria:

 - The taxonomies shall qualify to use the registered trademarks and service marks of XBRL International

 - The taxonomies shall qualify to be recognized by XBRL International as "Acknowledged" and "Approved" taxonomies

 - The taxonomies shall be made available for free use

 - The taxonomies shall follow the established taxonomy architecture in place for the taxonomies available at http://sec.gov/info/edgar/edgartaxonomies.shtml.

The SEC anticipates that any acquisition for the maintenance services discussed in this notice will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) after review of the responses to this announcement. 

The SEC is requesting that all interested parties respond to this notice with the following information:

1. Name and address

2. Phone number and email address

3. Description of the respondents client base, including all Federal customers

4. Capability Statement including how the respondent is able to meet the SEC needs. The
capability statement must include:

a) A description of the respondents solution in terms of processes, change management and
governance, public review procedures, testing and quality assurance, and high level
development plans;

b) A description of the software products and platforms necessary for taxonomy 
development, testing and quality assurance, public comment and review, and hosting, and
whether those products and platforms are commercial items currently available or could be
modified from commercial items currently available;

c) A description of the resources, technical expertise and subject matter expertise necessary
to successfully complete this type of project including the respondents ability to provide
these resources;

d) Past experiences on projects of similar nature; and

e) To the extent possible, any information on pricing or rough-order-of-magnitude estimates
that would assist the SEC in their planning for this acquisition

5. Respondents are also encouraged to provide feedback on the following questions:

a) As the number of taxonomies increases, both for SEC reporting uses and also for other 
purposes in the US and internationally, describe your experience coordinating data in this
manner and the capabilities and processes necessary to ensure consistency between
taxonomies and to the extent possible preventing overlapping content.

b) The SEC has already implemented a taxonomy for US GAAP, and under Release 33-9002
also has a requirement for a taxonomy for IFRS. Describe how the taxonomies could be
developed to provide an integrated taxonomy that could represent two standards
independently but also represent the ongoing state of convergence between the
standards. Describe how your capabilities and experience are suitable for this type of 
project. 

All questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing and addressed to Wanda J. Armwood, Contracting Officer at ArmwoodW@sec.gov on or before May 18, 2009.

Interested parties shall submit a capability package electronically to ArmwoodW@sec.gov. Capability packages are limited to 15 pages. The email shall be clearly marked SECHQ1-09-0001 in the subject line and must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on or before June 5, 2009. Please confirm receipt of the capability package.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare SystemsCommand (SPAWAR) in support of theNext Generation Enterprise Network(NGEN) program is seeking industrycomments in the area of InformationAssurance (IA).THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION(RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solelyfor information and planningpurposes  it does not constitute aRequest for Proposal (RFP) or apromise to issue an RFP in the future.This request for information does notcommit the Government to contract forany supply or service whatsoever.Further, the Navy is not at this timeseeking proposals and will not acceptunsolicited proposals.  Respondentsare advised that the U.S. Governmentwill not pay for any information oradministrative costs incurred inresponse to this RFI; all costsassociated with responding to this RFIwill be solely at the interested partysexpense.  Not responding to this RFIdoes not preclude participation in anyfuture RFP, if any is issued.  If asolicitation is released, it will besynopsized on the Federal BusinessOpportunities (FedBizOpps) websiteand the SPAWAR E-Commerce Centralwebsite at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  It is theresponsibility of the potential offerorsto monitor these sites for additionalinformation pertaining to thisrequirement.1.0    BackgroundGeneral background information on theNext Generation Enterprise Network(NGEN) can be located at the publiclyaccessible website:https://portal.peoeis.navy.mil/main/by clicking on the NGEN ReferenceLibrary link.Independent Security OperationsOversight and Assessment (SOO&A) isa reliable technique used to increasethe efficiency and effectiveness of aprojects IT components.  IndependentSOO&A can be used to assess theprobability that a proposed ITcomponent will address all factorsrequired for successful projectmanagement, development, andimplementation. These factors include:a. Meeting the stated projectrequirements,b. Being cost effective,c. Providing an industry acceptedapproach to information security,d. Providing an industry acceptedapproach to technical and ITimplementation,e. Accounting for maintenancef. Providing for adequate training andstaffing within the proposed projectenvironment.g. Mapping test and evaluations to thedeveloped requirements and testobjectives, andh. Allowing for the achievement of DoDGIG IA Campaign end states.Independent SOO&A provides for theearly detection and identification of riskelements within a program whichenables a Project Manager to takeaction to mitigate risks early in theproject life cycle.The DoN anticipates using IndependentSOO&A within the NGEN environment tomeet the following objectives:a. Deliver secure core enterpriseapplications to the war fighter andthose who support them.b. Ensure planning, development,management and support processesare in place and working properly.c. Ensure project managementdisciplines are incorporated into DoNskey IT-related projects throughoutNGENs project lifecycle.d. Provide leadership overarchingvisibility into enforcement levels,effectiveness and viability of theinformation technology securityprocesses as implemented in the NGENenvironment.e. Determine the technical feasibilityand soundness (i.e. from a securityperspective) of proposed projects. (i.e.virtualization, cloud computing, andother leading-edge technologies thatmay be applicable to an IndependentSOO&A effort).To accomplish these objectives, theDoN is developing a requirement toconduct Independent SOO&A.  Thesegoals will be applicable to the COSC,to any follow on NGEN contract actions,and to any other applicable Navalnetwork.  The DoN anticipates thisrequirement will include the followingtypes of testing and/or services:Red Team Testing: Unannounced,security posture assessment of theenterprise (hardware, software,processes, procedures, and people)and its response to unauthorizedactivities. Testing will identify gaps inthe system design, promote userawareness, and provide opportunitiesto evolve and enhance securityprocedures. Testing will facilitateperiodic system re-accreditation.Blue Team Testing: Continuoussecurity posture assessment of theenterprise.  Testing will includecooperative vulnerability scanning andfull spectrum Operational Security(OPSEC) assessments to routinelyexamine and analyze the efficacy ofthe implemented defenses.Green Team Testing: Scheduledsecurity posture assessment of theenterprise. Testing will determine theeffectiveness of contract fulfillment byvendors against a pre-determined andagreed upon range of SLAs. Testing willverify configuration management andaid in maintaining the security integrityof the network.Vendor Support: Support relationshipswith NGEN software or service providersto provide problem resolution in areaslike virus infection and InformationAssurance Vulnerability Management(IAVM) implementation.Technical Consultant Services:  SubjectMatter Experts (SMEs) who can provideoversight in thecreation/implementation of enterprisesecurity controls, templates andpolicies.2.0    Requested InformationBased upon the backgroundinformation located in the NGENreference library and in paragraph 2above, the DoN requests industryprovide comments and offer technicalsolutions and/or alternatives to theIndependent SOO&A approach andscope of the anticipated requirement.The DoN is interested in currentindustry standards and cutting edgetechnologies in the areas ofInformation Assurance.Responses to this RFI should take intoaccount regulations, policies, directivesand instructions associated with theDoD IT environment.Specific areas of interest include:a. Estimated skill sets and manninglevels needed to support the scope ofthe defined requirement to support anetwork of over 370,000 seats,700,000 users.b. How a potential IA service providermight support and implementIndependent SOO&A across the DONenterprise.c. Solutions on how Red, Blue, andGreen team methodologies could beincluded and used in the IndependentSOO&A framework to harden andensure the confidentiality, integrity,availability, and accountability of allspecified DON enterprise wide networks.d.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<BR><BR>JOINT CONTAMINATED SURFACE DETECTOR (JCSD)<BR><BR>Market Research<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  The Joint Project Manager for Nuclear Biological Chemical Contamination Avoidance (JPM NBCCA) is conducting a market survey regarding concepts and technologies to enhance standoff chemical detection in support of the Joint Contaminated Surface Detector (JCSD) program.  The JCSD program goal is to replace the Dual Wheel Sampling System (DWSS) with a standoff, on-the-move, near real-time capability to detect contamination on surfaces. <BR><BR>Key capabilities desired:<BR><BR>1.	Standoff.  The currently fielded surface detection system relies on two (2) silicon wheels making contact with the ground, capturing the chemical, and transporting it to a Mass Spectrometer.  This process is limited due to inherent physical reliability issues with a contact transport mechanism.  Having a system that does not contact the ground removes this limitation and will remove these reliability issues.<BR><BR>2.	On-the-Move.  The currently fielded surface detection system limits the speed at which the vehicle can move.  The vehicle cannot drive at a speed that causes the silicon wheels from losing contact with the ground.  A sensor that can detect at maneuver speeds is highly desired.<BR><BR>3.	Near Real-Time.  The current detection system can take few minutes from the time the chemical is collected on the silicon wheel to the time detection occurs.  A sensor that makes detections in a matter of seconds is highly desired.<BR><BR>The Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Unmanned Ground Reconnaissance (CUGR) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) integrated a downward looking Raman spectrometer into a HMMWV chassis.  The CUGR ACTD results showed the technology for a standoff, on-the-move, near real-time surface detector is mature.  However, the CUGR ACTD developed system requires additional maturation before field use.  In addition, the CUGR ACTD system integration required a hole to be cut into the floor of the vehicle which is cause for concern with vehicle platform managers.<BR><BR>To this end, the JPM NBCCA is requesting white paper submissions and comments on the JCSD draft performance specification, attached, to support potential technology development.  After review of industrys submissions, the Government may request promising candidates to demonstrate their system in the June-July 2009 timeframe at the candidates location.<BR><BR>This notice constitutes a Request for Information/Comment only.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION:  NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED UNDER THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR><BR>WHITE PAPER PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION:  All firms, corporations, organizations, including those within the U.S. Government, private industry, academic institutions, research institutions, non-profit organizations, etc., are encouraged to respond to this RFI by submitting a white paper.  There will be no opportunity for questions and answers associated with this RFI.<BR><BR>At a minimum, the white paper shall provide:<BR><BR>1.	Brief Description of System and Capabilities.  Describe the overall system and its capabilities.  Describe the key components of the system to include size, weight and power expected.  Describe key interfaces.  Comment on the draft JCSD performance specification with emphasis on areas that may be edited to provide a more concise and obtainable product.    Provide a requirements traceability matrix or cross reference to the system capabilities and the draft JCSD performance specification.<BR><BR>2.	System Maturity.  Identify the maturity of the system (e.g. breadboard, brass board, prototype, or production), estimated Technology Readiness Level (TRL), and the basis for which these assessments have been made.  Provide information on the test environment that the systems were demonstrated in to obtain the TRL assessment.  Provide information (if applicable) summarizing previous component or system level, testing performed independently or by US Government agencies or other test agencies.  Describe a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of effort and timeline required for maturing the system to a TRL of 7.  Please assign a TRL number in accordance with (IAW) definitions provided in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook Chapter 10.5.2.<BR><BR>3.	Potential Integration.  Describe how the system could be integrated onto an armored reconnaissance platform IAW the draft JCSD Performance Specification.  Please include a ROM of effort and timeline required for integration.<BR><BR>The white paper shall be limited to Twenty (20) pages (8.5 x 11), of English text.  It shall be single-spaced, 12 pitch, Arial font with 1 inch left, right, top and bottom margin.<BR><BR>All proprietary data that respondent intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes must be identified and appropriately marked.  See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104,4:52.215-1(e).  The respondent must also identify all technical data contained in the white paper that is to be treated by the Government as subject to restrictive markings.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data in the white paper.<BR><BR>The white paper shall be submitted in Microsoft Word format and include an electronic copy on CD-ROM compatible with Windows XP.  Respondents are responsible to ensure electronic copies on CD-ROM are virus free.  Submissions are to be submitted, not later than 5:00 PM <BR>22 May 2009, to the following address:  <BR><BR>	U.S. RDECOM Contracting Center<BR>	Edgewood Contracting Division<BR>	ATTN:  CCRD-ED/Brenda Aleman<BR>	E4455 Leitzan Road<BR>	Edgewood, MD 21010-5401<BR><BR>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the US Government, and does not imply an intention or the opportunity to acquire funding to support current or future development efforts.<BR>

If you would like the TDP CD to be sent to you via FEDEX please provide your companies FEDEX number.  The M10 Universal Destructor is used primarily to initiate the high explosive main charge in unfuzed bombs and artillery projectiles in place.  The destructor is designed to accommodate any ammunition with 1.5 inch 1.7 inch or 2 inch fuze wells.  The M10 is an adapter booster assembly consisting of a metal ammunition bushing a metal booster assembly a metal activator bushing and a metal blasting cap bushing.  The ammunition bushing is threaded externally to fit 1.7 inch or 2 inch diameter fuze wells.  Internally it is threaded to mate with the metal booster cups filled with Comp A3 pellets.  The booster cups threaded together to form an assembly are attached at the forward end to an activator bushing.  The Comp A3 pellets in the forward cup have center holes designed to accommodate a blasting cap or activator.  The 1.5 inch external thread which accepts the activator can be threaded into a 1.5 inch fuze cavity.  The activator bushing threaded to accept an M1 activator is assembled at the forward end to a blasting cap bushing which will accept any standard firing device.  Upon activation by blasting cap or M1 activator the Comp A 3 pellets in the booster explode.  The resulting detonating wave initiates the explosive filled target.  During shipment and storage the blasting cap bushing is sealed with a closing plug and cork gasket.<BR>Critical skills required in manufacturing the M10 include the ability to machine metal parts and press Comp A 3 pellets.

<DESC><p>The 42d Contracting Squadron, 50 LeMay Plaza South, Bldg 804, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112, is synopsizing a requirement to award a sole-source contract&nbsp; to Michigan State University to satisfy the needs of Squadron Officers College.&nbsp; Michigan State University has a Team Leadership laboratory where they are able to accomplish leadership and team research. They also conduct research on an ongoing basis within the LDS system with students at Squadron Officer School at Maxwell AFB using this system. The research is a collaborative undertaking between SOC faculty and staff and contractor faculty along with graduate students. Data generated in the LDS system can be shared and write-ups from the research presented in scientific journals and conferences as well as Air Force outlets believed to be appropriate by SOC. In the process of gaining a partnership with MSU, the data research gathered from the LDS system can also be used to enhance the learning and research outcomes of the LDS system for SOC and MSU. Along with the learning outcomes of LDS, the LDS system is proprietary to MSU. This would preclude other sources from using the LDS system and an entire new system would need to be developed along with the material used in the lectures. MSU took the relevant scientific research and built lessons that tie into the Enduring Leadership Competencies used in the Squadron Officer School curriculum. These tie-ins are the development of MSU and belong to them. The period of performance will include a base period of 1 Jul 09through 30 Sep 10. This is expected to be a Firm-Fixed Price. The North American Industrial Classification Code is&nbsp;611710 and the small business size standard is $7mil. The Performance Work Statement is attached. Point of contact for this requirement is Donald Perkins, who may be reached at donald.perkins@maxwell.af.mil or (334) 953-1549.</p>

<DESC>The Expeditionary Medical Logistics Program has a requirement for a Soil Analysis Package. In compliance with the Commands initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Expeditionary Medical Logistics Program applications, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Soil Analysis Package manufactured by Innov-X Systems, Inc.  The Soil Analysis Package made by Innov-X Systems, Inc.has been standardized for all of the FDPMUs.  The installed base is currently in all of the FDPMUs as well as each new FDPMU that is being built.  Therefore, the installed base of the Innov-X Systems, Inc. Soil Analysis Package within the Expeditionary Medical Logistics Program exceeds $66,000.00.  The amount of US Navy dollars invested in the consumables associated with this item is difficult to estimate, but can be considered to be approximately 10% of that cost or $6,600.  The Navy spends approximately $10,000 each year to maintain the Integrated Logistics Support for an item and all of its accessories, consumables and variants.    These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the FDPMUs.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability.  The list above identifies the equipment and accessories that must be procured to satisfy the needs of the government.

<RESPDATE>051809
<CONTACT>Aaron Alvarado, Phone 3014923630, Email aaron.alvarado@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Skytel for paging services for NRC-owned paging devices in order to maintain an emergency response posture to incidents and conditions for the protection of public health and safety.  The estimated period of performance for this requirement consists of a one year base and three one-year options.  The NRC owns approximately 140 pagers which are distributed to NRC employees who perform services either directly related with emergency response functions supporting the NRC on a daily basis or provide additional support functions on an as-needed basis when an incident arises.  The use of Skytel specific paging services will allow the NRC to maintain its emergency response posture and reduce the cost of providing this service to the Government. ICOD has determined that Skytel is the only service provider who can provide for continuous paging services, minimize cost, and maintain the NRCs emergency response posture for the following reasons: the current paging services utilize Skytel owned toll free numbers which will not be transferrable to another vendor as they are the property of Skytel, the selection of another vendor would result in a wholesale change of the contact numbers for emergency responders, increased staff resource utilization to update and redistribute emergency call out lists, and modifications to automated notification systems with programmed Skytel numbers, and testing of the new numbers  thus inhibiting the agencys ability to respond to emergencies should incidents of public health and safety arise, which is directly tied to NRCs mission; and the NRC would incur increased costs associated with the wholesale change of contract numbers including contractor staff time to update and redistribute emergency call out lists, modifications to automated notification systems with programmed Skytel numbers, testing of the new telephone numbers, and account set-up fees or service initiation associated with new number accounts.

The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 517210, Size Standard: 1,500 Employees.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRCs needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 10 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Power Trac, Inc. of Tazewell, VA, for the acquisition of U.S. manufactured 1 each Model PT-1850, Power Trac Slope Mower, 65 HP Diesel; Model T3013, 90 inch 3 blade rough cut mower; Model K137, Finish Cut Kit, including shipping to project location in Beech Creek, PA.  Machine shall be rated for 45 degree slopes; machine shall be articulated steering; dual bar tread tires for each wheel; hydrostatic, infinitely variable speed drive; self leveling operator seat; ROPS with operator seatbelt; 12 volt electrical system; strobe light; 5# ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher.  Power Trac has the only known unit that offers wide tracking, very low center of gravity, two axle machine that can navigate the steep slopes without the sliding off in an uncontrolled manner. It is also large enough, with enough engine horsepower and large enough mower deck to be able to efficiently cut the large areas of grass that exist at the project location.  The project also considered the Dew Eze All-Terrain Mower, Model 72LC; the A E B I Terratrac TT75, and the Hustler model 3700.  The 72LC was found to be rated at a 34 degree slope and the project location has a few spots that exceed 40 degrees.  The Hustler Model 3700 also did not meet the demands for steeper slopes.  The Terratrac TT75 was found to be outside of our price range.  The Power Trac Model was found to have the best value considering operator safety and estimated cost.  Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The determination to not compete the proposed acquisition is within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by May 15, 2009 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>FBO Special NoticeThis is not a request for proposal or a request for quote.  There is no solicitation document available.  This is a notice of intent of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) to negotiate a sole source contract with Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT), for software and associated maintenance for VERITAS and POWERPATH software.   Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.  VERITAS and POWERPATH is available on SEWP, however, it will be acquired from Northrop Grumman I.T., Inc. via the AACES Prime Vendor Contract V200P-909.  AITC has an existing VERITAS and POWERPATH licensing agreement through NGIT for all VERITAS and POWERPATH products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Please reply no later than May 15, 2009 to Sylvia Thomas at (512) 326-6877.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges.

The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-02-H-5003-0023.<br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.

In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoters technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.

Factor I - Technical Capability 

a. Contract Requirements 

Quotations will be evaluated on the quoters ability to provide all of the contract requirements relating to meeting space, lodging, food and beverage and audio visual equipment requirements. Quotations must address the quoters ability to comply with the ADA as it relates to lodging and meeting space. Quotations should reflect quality of services provided and maintained.

b. Availability of Dates 

Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to those quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates.  The Government will not consider alternate dates other than what is specified in this annoucement.

c. Location 

Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility located within one of the following postal zip codes:  77002, 77003, 77024, 77041, 77042, 77043, 77054, 77056, 77077, 77079, 77080, 77084 and 77095 with adequate parking for participants and presenters. 

Factor II - Past Performance 

The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance for the same or similar services awarded within the past three (3) years.  One of the three (3) references must be a federal agency.  The quoter will be evaluated based on customer satisfication and timeliness.  Requested information for each reference shall include the following:
 
Contract type
Contract number
Contract/Task value
Agency/Company Name
Agency/Company point of contact telephone number
Duration of task/contract
Type of services provided (brief description)
List any problems encountered on each contract and the contractors corrective actions

EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of timely deliveries and customer service on similar requirements. NOTE: In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase quoters overall rating nor decrease it.

Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities portion of the technical evaluation factors.

Factor III  Price

The price quotation will be evaluated against the independent Government Price Estimate.

Notice: The Government reserves the right to make contract award without discussion with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, quoters must submit their most favorable terms from a technical standpoint. In addition to the above, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

The provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. The contractor shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Item with your quote. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Item and Clause 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order-Commercial Items are incorporated by reference. Clause 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government - Alternate I, Clause 52.222-3 Convict Labor, Clause 52.222-19 Child Labor  Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, Clause 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, Clause 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, Clause 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, Clause 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons, Clause 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases, Clause 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer  Central Contractor Registration are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a Brand Name requirement for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number RFQ0080-09 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and should be referenced on all correspondence.  The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-31, effective on April 20, 2009. This solicitation is a 100% total small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541519.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all contractors to be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to receive contract award or payments.  The EEOC intends to make a single award from this solicitation. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The EEOC has a brand name requirement for     RightNow Customer Relations Management (CRM) Software Licenses as follows: CLIN 0001: Seventy (70) RightNow Enterprise Suite (Part No. ENT-NU-FT1): $________; CLIN 0002: Two (2), Web Portal  Web Portal Page View per 100,000 Viewed per Month (Part No. WP-100K-FT1): $_________; CLIN 0003: One (1), Web Portal  Web Portal Page View per 10,000 Viewed per Month (Part No. WP-10K-FT1): $________; CLIN 0004: One (1) Web Portal Page Interface  Web Portal Interface Low Traffic (Part No. WP-LOW-FT1):  $________;  CLIN 0005: One (1) RightNow 500 Surveys  RightNow feedback 500 Surveys per Month (500 included free); Part No. MSFC-500-FT1): $________;  and CLIN 0006  Preferred Support- Part No. PRE-FT1: $________. TOTAL PRICE TO GOVERNMENT: $_______ (CLIN Nos. 0001 thru 0006) (NOTE: The above seventy (70) software licenses consist of the renewal of sixty three (63) current and purchase of seven (7) additional licenses). This software is a Customer Relations Management (CRM) software tool that allows EEOC to more effectively and efficiently answer calls from the public. The EEOC is currently using the software throughout its Intake Information Group (IIG) to access the EEOC information contained in the knowledgebase and manage customer records. When a call comes into an Information Intake Representative (IIR) located at one of  the EEOC fifteen (15) offices that support the IIG, the IIR utilizes customer relations management software to access information about the EEOC and the laws the agency enforce, as well as to enter and track information about callers.  The software is a hosted solution that allows each EEOC IIR to enter the information remotely and management to run reports utilizing the information collected by the IIR.  EEOC requires a one year extension for its current 63 RightNow licenses as well as increasing the overall license count by seven (7).  This will bring the EEOC configuration  to a total of 70 RightNow Enterprise licenses.  By having customer relations management software for one year, it will allow for maintenance and upgrade support for the software licenses purchased as well as provide technical support for the agencys current RightNow CRM application.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The anticipated period of performance will be  for one year, from May 16, 2009 up through May 15, 2010.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  EEOC fifteen (15)  designated offices which support the IIG.  The quoter shall include the following with their quote: Part I: The quoter shall provide a price and description of all CLINs (0001 thru 0006) with the total price.

All contractors who provide goods/services to the EEOC must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR): http://www.ccr.gov. PART IV:  Completed copies of FAR 52.212-3 or an online representations and certification application (ORCA) record must be submitted with the quote. On line Certifications and Representations is available at: http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to comply with the ORCA registration may deem quoter ineligible for award. The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government. BASIS of AWARD:  Award will be made based on best value using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach.

To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter.  An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies.  The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. Once the quotes have been determined technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price.  All responsible small business sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR SENIOR MONITORING AND EVALUALTION (M&E) ADVISOR

A.  OVERVIEW: 

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been a key partner with the Government of Bangladesh over the past 30 years in all major development sectors.  Currently, USAID/Bangladeshs development portfolio includes programs in Health, Education, Democracy and Governance, Food Security and Food Aid, Private Enterprise, Environment, Infrastructure, and Disaster Mitigation, Response and Reconstruction.  

The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Advisor has overarching responsibility for Mission-wide monitoring, reporting and evaluation.  S/he will supervise one Foreign Service National (FSN) M&E Specialist and provide technical support and training to Program Office Program Specialist Backstops on M&E.  

The initial performance period will be two years.  Based on the programmatic results achieved and possible required programmatic follow-up, an extension of this Contract will be considered based on availability of funds and satisfactory performance.  Women and minorities are encouraged to apply. 

B.  BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION:

This position is located in the Program Office of the USAID Mission in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  The position is supervised by the Deputy Program Office Director and reports directly to this person. 

The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor will lead and coordinate monitoring, reporting, and evaluation activities on USAID programs in Bangladesh.  S/he will ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to measure program effectiveness and assess the potential for focused efforts to develop and/or employ more efficient or more powerful methods for empirical data-gathering, analysis, and reporting than those currently in place.  S/he ensures that project/activity information systems accurately monitor, evaluate, and report on the progress and impact of development programs.

This expert utilizes recognized, current means of collecting and interpreting data in order to ensure interventions are evidence-based.  S/he performs analytical tasks to provide essential performance information needed by the Mission to strengthen the quality of programs/activities; and assists Technical Office staff in setting appropriate performance targets according to USAIDs reporting requirements.

The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor reviews results packages and program components in all development sectors with the goal of improving the ability of all parties participating in development activities funded or supported by USAID to monitor and report on progress toward a defined objective or set of objectives. In carrying out these duties, s/he is responsible for the transfer of information on social science analysis methods, for developing program monitoring and evaluation concepts which are relevant to time frames normally faced in USAID-supported activities, and for assisting the USAID Mission, host government, NGOs, and other customers to apply data results appropriately and cost-effectively.

The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor will provide substantive leadership in the area of performance monitoring and assessment of program impact evaluation across the Mission portfolio and will: 1) recommend refinements to programs and adjustments to indicators according to research findings, 2) develop Mission systems to ensure that M&E data collected by the Mission and its partners is effectively used to help achieve Missions development objectives, and 3) participate in all Mission activities, including strategy development and program design, as appropriate.

The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor will also work with the Program Office to manage internal information relevant to the Operational Plan process and related indicators, and provide guidance on data collection and reporting systems for ongoing monitoring of programs and results.  The Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor will supervise the Missions initiative to develop and utilize Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to strengthen its programmatic monitoring, coordination, and evaluation.


C.	MAJOR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:

Annual Portfolio Performance Monitoring Systems Analysis and
Improvement:                            

1.  On an annual basis, the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor will be responsible for providing an executive briefing and status report of less than 20 pages, including all annexes, in which the databases, tools, and instruments being used by the Mission as part of its performance monitoring and evaluation system should be listed.  If the databases and tools are in development, their status and progress is to be reported.  The first part of the report will be an assessment, based on a set of criteria to be developed, of the extent to which the Mission is successful in using performance information to guide programming decisions.  The report will outline observed deficiencies or weaknesses in the Missions M&E systems, procedures, and information dissemination practices, and make specific recommendations to the Missions Senior Management Team (SMT) on focus areas for improvement, costs associated with the recommendations, as well as propose an action plan for the following year.   For the first year of the contract, an M&E action plan will be developed within 30 days after the M&E advisor begins work.  Through the preparation of the action plan the M&E Advisor will identify and analyze program performance for the Mission and submit recommendations for evaluations of critical sectors and programs for USAID.   The action plan will focus on improving the Missions ability to use performance information to guide both implementation of our existing programs and the design of our new programs. The plan, to be approved by the Senior Management Team (SMT), will propose the assignment of responsibility for implementation to various Mission offices and individuals as appropriate.  Overseeing and coordinating the implementation of the approved action plan will constitute a significant part of the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisors work plan each year.

2.  Develop information and communications tools to assist with Mission management of performance data.  Work with Mission technical staff and program office backstops to adopt these new tools and to incorporate their use in program management decision making.  

3.  By the end of the first year, document the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Advisor and other M&E unit position responsibilities in a position binder to contain the following:  an inventory of tasks, an annual calendar for accomplishing these tasks, written procedures and relevant references and resources to be used, performance standards, and any other relevant supporting information related to the position.

Coordination of Mission Performance Review and Reporting:  

1.  Annual Mission Performance Plan and Report:  Develop Mission guidelines and annual calendar for the production of the annual performance report, in conformance with the Agency guidelines issued each year.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations.  The program will seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

     This announcement is open and continuous until May 20, 2010, although selections may be made in advance of that date.

     NOTE: It is OTI's intent to contract with multiple Personal Service Contractors (PSCs) under this solicitation. All applications received on or before the following dates will be reviewed for the number of available positions on that date:

     A candidate not selected during an earlier period is required to reapply for additional positions available in subsequent review periods. Applications will be reviewed for all available positions under this solicitation subsequent to the date of receipt.

4.  POSITION TITLE: OTI Field Program Manager (Multiple Positions)

5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a tandem position that, depending on the qualifications of the candidate, can be filled at either the GS-12 (salary range: $59,383 - $77,194), GS-13 (salary range: $70,615 - $91,801), or GS-14 (salary range $83,445 - $108,483)  equivalent level, non-locality pay.  If a candidate is selected at the GS-12 level, there is a possibility for advancement to GS-13 level. The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-12, GS-13, or GS-14 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.  

If an incumbent is selected at the GS-12 grade level, the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement up one equivalent grade to the GS-13 level, following at least one (1) year or two (2) years at the GS-12 level.  To be eligible for promotion, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications of the position, and must also receive a performance rating of Excellent or higher in the annual performance evaluation.  The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee meets the minimum qualifications of the position, is performing successfully at the current grade, and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed. (There is no promotion potential in this contract from the GS-13 to the GS-14 grade level, though candidates at the GS-13 level may apply for the GS-14 level position when they feel they meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-14 level, if/when the position is being advertised again in the future).  

NOTE:  Applicants who submit an application for the GS-14 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as outlined in this solicitation and as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-13 or GS-12 positions if they have not submitted separate applications for them.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States governments top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

USAID/OTI plans to launch a new program in Afghanistan, in line with US Government priorities.  The program will implement civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, primarily during the clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations that seek to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects.  In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.  

USAID/OTI, through its implementing partner(s), will manage an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above.  It is expected that activities will range across numerous sectors including but not limited to irrigation and small, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, etc.  Small livelihood activities may be considered if it is clear they have the full support of the community, and will benefit the community as a whole.  

OBJECTIVE

The objective for hiring for this position is to support the OTI country team in the development, oversight, and management of the OTI country program.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Q & A for Solicitation W912NR-09-R-0008 NOW CLOSING 1200 CST 8 MAY 09<BR><BR>1. Who had this job prior?  NO ONE HAD THIS TYPE OF CAONTRACT BEFORE. <BR><BR>2. What was the winning bid on the contract last year or the last year of the original contract? Either price per person or price per exam would be fine.  N/A SEE ABOVE ANSWER TO QUESTION 1.<BR><BR>3. The SOW states 2 different numbers of personnel needing <BR>examinations: 270 on the first page of the SOW, 370 LANG in the <BR>Procedures and Standards and approximately 325 on supplies or services <BR>price/cost page. THE NEW ESTIMATED NUMBER OF EXAMINATIONS IS 220, AND THE LOCATIONS ARE NOW ONLY AT FORT POLK(90), LA, AND PINEVILLE(130), LA.  A REQUIREMENT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED IN HAMMOND OR SLIDELL, LA.<BR><BR>4. When would you like this job completed?   26 JUNE 2009<BR><BR>5. Can there be a minimum number of exams required when providing the bid? YES, BUT I DO NOT SEE HOW THIS SHOULD REFLECT YOUR PROPOSAL.<BR><BR>6. Since this is a federal job does the physician have to be board certified with the state?    NO<BR><BR>7. Do you want us [vendor] to use our Audiometric equipment or the LANG<BR>equipment? VENDORS SHALL USE THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT.   Will we [the vendor] be required to enter the info [data] into DOEHRS?    YES<BR><BR>8. Medical Surveillance sections requires stool for occult blood but this in not mentioned in the price/cost section, are they required or not?      THIS REQUIREMENT DOES NOT NEED TO DO A STOOL HEMOCULT.<BR> <BR>9. Verify whether the requirement calls for a phlebotomist to work separately from the crew to provide early blood draws for everyone.  This is important since it requires an additional technician.  BLOOD DRWS WOULD NEED TO BE PERFORMED ALL AT ONE TIME, BACK TO BACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MORINING BECAUSE EVERYONE WILL BE FASTING.  IF THAT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STAFF, THEN ONE MORE PERSON NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED.<BR><BR>10. 220 receive the following -<BR>	Medical History<BR>	Physician's Hands-on Examination<BR>	Audiogram<BR>	Chem Screen 25/CBD/Urinalysis<BR>	Blood Lead/ZPP<BR>	C-Reactive Protein<BR>	Cardiogram<BR>	PA Chest x-rays<BR>	Pulmonary Function and Respirator Clearance Visual Acuity<BR><BR>WE NO LONGER REQUIRE THE C-REACTIVE PROTEIN TEST AND DO AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM ONLY FOR THOSE OVER 40 YEARS OLD.<BR><BR>11. Then WHAT _____  (smaller number (which I don't know specifically) receive the following - DOT exam Cadmium Exposure Panel Chromium - Urine PSA.   Can you please let me [the vendor] know if this is the number you would like me to follow?  THE CADMIUM EXPOSURE PANEL CHROMIUM  URINE PSA IS NOT REQUIRED.<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>Modification issued in response to inquiries regarding clarification of solcitation:<BR><BR>1. Is there an incumbent?<BR><BR>ANS:  No, this is a new requirement.<BR><BR>2. Would the NHNG consider reducing the Microsoft Gold Partner qualification?  If the answer is no, would the NHNG permit the vendor a 6-month period in which to get the partnership?<BR><BR>ANS:  We will not consider waiving the 'Microsoft Certified Partner' requirement as posted in the solicitation at this time. We would only re-look this if we don't receive qualified responses to the solicitation as posted.  Microsoft Gold Partner qualifications must be valid at the time the solicitation closes.<BR><BR>3. Are there any page limitations on the various documents?<BR><BR>ANS:  No.<BR><BR>4.  Will implementation of DoD 5015.2 records management be required under this contract?<BR><BR>ANS:  We are not at all sure that DoD 5015.2 is applicable (attached document).  We are customizing the customer interface for SharePoint, but certainly not designing new software.  Our official records management application is ARIMS anyway. ARIMS Provides life cycle management instructions for the systematic identification, maintenance, storage, retrieval, retirement, and destruction of Army information recorded on any medium (including electronic).  Directive requirements address access control, file retention, security, backwards compatibility of data, search ability, etc.  File retention and access control requirements are maintained at the user level, and are not the contractors responsibility.  Platform security is also the responsibility of the NHARNG. There is already a requirement in the SOW to 'Configure and build search functionality'.<BR><BR>5.  Will you be providing the necessary licenses (including client access licenses) or will the successful offeror be responsible for obtaining them?<BR><BR>ANS:  Yes, we are responsible for software licensing.<BR><BR>6.  Will development under this contract be using Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Standard or Enterprise?<BR><BR>ANS:  Enterprise.<BR><BR>7.  What kind of operating system will this software run on? Windows/Linux, etc.<BR><BR>ANS:  Operating on a Windows 2003 server.  The solution needs to have a web interface, an email submission/ticket creation feature as well as a call-center (helpdesk/admin) ticket creation feature.  <BR><BR>8.  As far as the CAC requirement, because the system is web based and in the network, if a user is able to access the help desk url, is it not safe to say that they have already been validated with their CAC?<BR><BR>ANS:  For the most part, yes.  The web site will need to authenticate for every connection/visit and not maintain a cache.  Some web servers expect to receive a username/password type combination for authentication.  Our users do not have this combination.  They have the Common Access Card (CAC) and the associate PIN.  The PIN resides on the CAC and the resulting authentication hash is what is transmitted to our authentication servers.  Depending on how the web services are designed or setup up dictates if the Windows Integrated Authentication works.<BR><BR>9.  The last sentence in the section states... 'Vendor submitting quote must perform under this contract and shall not subcontract performance.'  Does this mean you will not consider team responses from a prime vendor teaming with one or more other vendors?<BR><BR>ANS:  This is an open market unrestricted solicitation, you may submit a quote if your company intends to perform the work without subcontracting the performance.  Your partner companies may submit their quotes direct to us without utilizing Prime Vendor Teaming, as is done when using GSA Contracts, as long as they intend to perform the work without subcontracting.<BR><BR>10.  Any chance this could be changed to Veteran Owned Small Business status.<BR><BR>ANS:  It is set as unrestricted.  We do not intend to restrict competition on this requirement.  <BR>

<DESC><p>Purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received in reference to the specifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">1) The term "Hyperspctral" refers to a sensor with the ability to measure simultaneously spectral information from multiple spatial locations (see our web site, under PRODUCTS and the HyperScan). As such, the subject solicitation does not talk about the Field of View(FOV) desired for the instrument. Also, "how many spatial positions are needed?" The answer can be from 1 to hundreds or thousands. If theanswer is "one" can this be defined as a "spectrometer" rather than a "hyperspectral"?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reply: Field of View (FOV):The above ocean surface water radiance sensor and sky radiance sensor shall have 3 degrees FOV. A larger FOV may cause problems with integrating over larger ranges of variability (see NASA/TM-2000-209966 Ocean Optics Protocols for Satellite Ocean Color Sensor Validation).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spatial positions:The required instrument shall not produce spatial/pixel composite images. The required instrument shall produce a measurement at a single specified latitude and longitude location.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;2)Is "water radiance" referring to the reflected radiance off the water as seen by the downlooking instrument?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reply: Water radiance is defined here as radiance emanating from the sea surface at a zenith and azimuth angle. Water radiance is measured by the downlooking instrument.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3) While operating on a boat / mooring / and airborne -- can I assume that the Hyperspectral sensor is always down-looking? Does the sky radiance cover the full hemisphere or is this a directional measurements? Should the sun be blocked from sky radiance?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reply: The above ocean surface water radiance sensor shall measure L(surface) and is always down-looking. The sky radiance sensor shall measure L(sky) looking upward at a specified angle (see Chpt 10 NASA/TM 2000-209966). The sun should not be blocked from sky radiance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;4) The downwelling irradiance -- is that again a cosine response to thetotal downwelling energy?</p>
<p>Reply:&nbsp; Downwelling irradiance (Es) is the incident spectral irradiance measured above the sea surface with a cosine sensor (see Chpt 10 NASA/TM 2000-209966).</p>
<p>&nbsp;No change in response date, May 21,2009.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 
Washington, D. C. 20593-0001

<p>This project is intended for repairing landslides at the Lower Honda Ridge Road at VAFB, CA. Work will involve removing all the existing asphalt in two areas. Station 52 + 30 to <br />Station 54 + 00 (Area 1) will be over excavated at a 5-foot depth, with a 2-foot keyway on each side of the road. Station 55 + 45 to Station 62 + 00 (Area 2) will be over excavated section (Station 56 + 75 to Station 60 + 50) and will consist of over excavating 10 feet in depth, with a 5-foot keyway on the low side of the road. On the high side of the road the existing cut slope will be cut back approximately 24 to 30 feet to move the road away from the vertical edge of the pavement. This will create an approximately new 2:1 cut slope and move the road over 12 feet to the high side. This will expand the shoulders of the road. All standards and specifications are in compliance with the soils report provided. Due to needed drainage control over side drains will be removed and replaced with new material. Energy dissipater will be installed at the end of the downstream side of the culvert. Road widening, earth work, asphalt construction will induce: Clear &amp; grub; Excavate unsuitable material; Over excavate unstable sub-structure; Grind out road; Compacted fill; Stabilized aggregated base; Install new over side drains/asphalt concrete aprons; Remove &amp; replace 18-inch diameter culverts; Apply 3-inch minimum asphalt pavement; Apply striping to new pavement to original configuration; facility to be reused as a recycled road base or used for road base on site.</p>

<DESC><p>The intent of this project is to repair the north edge of Road West of Bldg 441, on Arguello Blvd in VAFB, CA. This project is based on improving storm water drainage, and widening the roadway to reduce heavy equip breaking off the edge of pavement, which causes storm water to seep through the cracks. Also the widen part of the road will carry an asphalt berm to control the drainage. Contractor will repair the existing east side of the road at the turn by over excavating the shoulder of the road and keying in the area to stabilize the sub-grade below and restore the over side drain. The over side drain will consist of keying in a stabilized sub-grade for an erosion control stabilization fabric installation with rip rap on it. Once stabilization has been achieved 3 new asphalt aprons that will tie in with the over side drain to collect the upper steep grade water drainage, one will be installed at the turn of the road and 2 at the low point indicated on attached map. The widen asphalt shoulder will vary, and will be excavated at a depth of 12" and marifi 600 fabric installed as required. Some asphalt &amp; sub-grade material will be removed and replaced due to failures in the sub-grade transferring to the failure of the asphalt.</p>

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  The Government is likely to allow contractor teaming arrangements in any solicitation expected to result from this synopsis. A contractor teaming arrangement is when the offeror submitting a proposal will significantly depend on the products, capital contributions or expertise [in whole, or in part] of another company(or companies) to successfully complete the terms of any contract that may result from the solicitation. If, after reading the requirements listed in this synopsis, a company cannot meet all of the requirements at this time, you are highly encouraged to: 1) register your firm on the interested vendors list for this solicitation at this www.fbo.gov website, and 2) submit a capabilities package to the DeCA contracting office describing the work your company is capable of providing, even if your firm cannot at this time meet all of the requirements exactly as stated below.

This is not a solicitation or request for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this synopsis.  There is no solicitation or additional information available at this time. This synopsis is issued in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.  This Sources Sought Notice is to determine the availability of small business HUB ZONE (certified or non-certified) sources, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN, or SMALL DISADVANTAGED sources who are interested in submitting an offer on a proposed acquisition to provide fresh fruits and vegetables to each of the thirty (36) Area 5 military commissary store locations assigned to the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA).

DeCAs military commissaries are Government-owned facilities designed to operate similar to commercial retail supermarkets.  DeCAs commissaries provide food items and other merchandise for resale to authorized shoppers at a cost savings when compared to the same or similar products sold in commercial retail markets.

DeCA is seeking small business concerns who qualify as HUB Zone (certified or non-certified), Service Disabled Veteran, and Small Disadvantaged Businesses who are capable of meeting the requirements listed below in providing a full line of fresh fruits and vegetable products and potted plants to 36 military commissary stores geographically located in the states of Georgia, Florida, Alabama Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Puerto Rico.  The proposed NAICS for this acquisition is 424480, which sets the small business threshold at 500 employees.  

WEB-BASED ORDERING SYSTEM:
Contractors must be capable of providing and maintaining a licensed web-based retail ordering system.  The web-based system must have the capability to receive and process orders from all the commissary locations to be supported under any contract that may result from the proposed solicitation, send electronic price updates, create detailed sales and order history reports, and provide inventory management.  The contractor-owned pricing and ordering system must be able to interface with DeCAs existing systems, i.e. allow DeCA personnel to access their system via the Internet without any additional cost or effort to DeCA.  Therefore, all the necessary software, equipment, and/or web page developments and/or enhancements shall be provided at no additional cost to the Government.  

CONTRACTOR FACILITY REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall be responsible for providing all necessary licenses, permits, supervision, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution, inventory management, and personnel at the contractors own facilities/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort, and deliver all required FF&V items to the various commissary locations that expect to be serviced.  The contractor will be required to deliver FF&V destined for Puerto Rico to the Government's designated export location.  

DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Distribution is a key factor in a successful FF&V program. A successful distribution system relies on two main factors, a large volume of product movement and a sufficient number of well-placed distribution centers. When these two factors are present, customers will receive the freshest products available.  Each consolidation and/or distribution center utilized by the contractor in performance of the resulting contract shall have multiple temperature-controlled areas in order to meet the different recommended temperature requirements for the various products in order to maintain shelf life and ensure the FF&V received at each location is of the freshest and highest quality. The lead-time from order placement to product receipt at the store level for CONUS locations (Continental USA) will not exceed 24 hours, and will not exceed 48 hours for order placement in Puerto Rico.

USDA INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:
The contractor shall work with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to ensure that all products are inspected, received, stored, staged, and shipped in accordance with USDA standards.  

ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS:

The contractor shall provide additional support and promotions to each commissary store in Area 5.  Additional support includes point of sale material, recipe cards, pamphlets, coupons, seasonal dcor, and/or other material that is often available from produce commissions.  Additional support also includes value added services that are designed to enhance the overall produce program and increase customer satisfaction through a well-merchandised produce department.  Further, additional support includes weekly merchandising visits to each commissary store location, and periodic merchandising support during promotions, resets, and/or grand opening events that provide show-stopping merchandising techniques and SUPER sale priced items.

<DESC>The subject synopsis is being amended to change the estimated date for release of the solicitation to May 7, 2009.

The objective of this solicitation is to establish a Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Performance Based Service Contract(s) for Newborn Screening services to test for 53 inherited, metabolic disorders.  The supply/service portion of the initiative will be firm-fixed and not subject adjustment during the life of the contract.  The transportation of collected specimen samples from the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) to the contractors laboratory will be subject to an Economic Price Adjustment.  The goal of Department of Defense (DoD) Newborn Screening Program is to obtain a comprehensive, centralized laboratory for Newborn Screening services in order to improve efficiencies, standardize the newborn screening benefit, ensure quality, and achieve best value in laboratory testing. The successful contractor(s) will be required to conduct newborn screening laboratory tests for all neonates born within military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) worldwide and for any neonatal specimen collected at an MTF during a follow-up medical appointment.

This procurement will be awarded using Best Value Source Selection Procedures to a maximum of (2) two vendors. One vendor will be responsible for servicing the Continental United States/Alaska/Hawaii (CONUS/AK/HI) region and one vendor to service the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) region.  Based on the results of the evaluation one award may be made to the same vendor for both the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions.

The DSCP Electronic Catalog will be the sole means by which orders for the Newborn Screening will be placed, confirmed and invoiced under this contract. The unit price for the Specimen Collection Kit must be included in the price per unit of the Newborn Screening Services identified in this procurement.  

The contractor is required to perform Newborn Screening testing for the 53 disorders (see Attachment 1).  As new disorders are made in the field of Newborn Screening, the disorder or testing procedure may be added to the successful vendor(s) contract on a post award basis.  

The contract will encompass the following services for each newborn:
 Provision of specimen collection kits and all necessary supplies 
 Timely transport of collected specimens (applies to vendors who offer this as FOB Destination)
 Accurate and timely laboratory testing of specimens
 Accurate and timely interpretation of test results
 Accurate and timely, comprehensive reporting/communication of results
 Data management
 Technical assistance
 Clinical consultation to laboratory and clinical staff within the Military Health Care System
 Follow-up services
 Participation in quality assurance programs and reporting of quality assurance data

As part of their proposal offerors are required to provide a copy of their CLIA license or certificate. 

Award of the CONUS/AK/HI region will be evaluated separately from the OCONUS region.  Vendors may submit proposals to service the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions individually or collectively.  However, all MTFs located within these regions must be serviced to be considered for award.  Vendors technical and price proposals will be evaluated using Best Value Source Selection Procedures.   Technical Merit will be considered more important than price.  This procurement will be awarded to a maximum of (2) two vendors. One vendor will be responsible for servicing CONUS/AK/HI MTFs and the other vendor will service OCONUS MTFs.  Based on the results of the evaluation one award may be made to the same vendor for both the CONUS/AK/HI and OCONUS regions. 

The term of the contract(s) will be a (1) one year Base Ordering Period with four (4) one-year unilateral Option Ordering Periods.  This procurement has an estimated value of $2.8 million annually ($13.9 over the full five years) for the CONUS/AK/HI region, and $0.4 million annually ($2.0 million over the full five years) for the OCONUS region.

<DESC>Aerospace and transportation industry changes necessitate that the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) maintain a Quality Management System (QMS) that will enable the total organization to continually manage change that effectively improves safety oversight of the United States (U.S.) National Aerospace System (NAS).  The AVS organization is composed of over 7000 people geographically distributed to over 150 locations that execute system, business and technical processes.  The most effective means to achieve this goal is for the AVS organization to sustain their fulfillment of the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 9001:2000 requirements.  Having completed one (1) three-year cycle of registration and surveillance audits, AVS must now complete a recertification audit.  In order to accomplish this goal, AVS requires the services of a qualified contractor to perform the required recertification audit and the subsequent surveillance audits.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract for one base year, with two one year options.
This is a full and open competition.  All interested sources are referred to the attached SIR/RFO.  All responses to this SIR/RFO must reference the solicitation number:  DTFAWA-09-R-01489 and be submitted to the following address:

<DESC>The U.S.D.A. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) have worked cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) since 1998 to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (NRA), including eight butterflies endemic to the Spring Mountains.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morands checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  These were identified as priority in the CA based on a limited number of locations where the butterflies are currently known to occur.  Autecology studies are imperative to determine why the ranges of these four species are restricted and help provide detailed information necessary to restore and improve butterfly habitat and range.  Given the demand to provide recreation and other uses on the Spring Mountains NRA, there is an urgent need to understand the basic biology and develop a management strategy for these four butterfly species to appropriately inform decision making.  

The Solicitation will be posted at this website on or about 10/30/2008.  If there is a "Pre-Proposal" conference/site walk offered, the details will be in the solicitation, once published.  The technical point of contact is Amy Nichols, (702) 515-5421.  All questions should be submitted in writing via FAX to Contracting Officer at (702) 839-5599 or E-mail at sroehr@fs.fed.us so that we have a record of the question, and can make a determination if the answer needs to be published in the form of a solicitation amendment.

<DESC>This procurement is an Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) opportunity at the Naval Submarine Base New London (NSBNL), Groton, Connecticut.  The proposed site is comprised of paved and unimproved area totaling approximately 4.34 acres.  The site available for lease is located at the southeast ("SE") corner of NSBNL at the intersection of Crystal Lake Road and Route 12.  NSBNL is on the east bank of the Thames River, partially located in both, the Town of Groton, Connecticut and the Town of Ledyard, Connecticut, approximately 55 miles from Providence, RI, 50 miles from New Haven, CT, and 55 miles from Hartford, CT.  The EUL site is located within the fence line of NSBNL, which is a closed base, not open to the general public.  Ingress and egress to the site could potentially be obtained from public roads Route 12 or Crystal Lake Road by repositioning the existing security fence.
Procurement Process:
The Navy is seeking a lessee to establish, operate and maintain a retail/recreational development that will enhance the quality of life for Navy personnel and the surrounding community and serve as the primary economic driver of the site in exchange for in-kind-consideration not less than the fair market value of the leasehold interest in the real property.
The Government intends to award the EUL using a two-phased, best value source selection process.  Specific source selection procedures, submission requirements, evaluation criteria, and the obligations and responsibilities of the successful Offeror are identified in the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) N40085-09-RP-00018
RFQ N40085-09-RP-00018:  The RFQ is issued as an attachment to this Announcement.  The RFQ is also available at http://www.navyeul.com/projects/new_london_corner/docs.php.  While the Navy intends to enter into a Lease with an Offeror selected through the process set forth in the RFQ, the Navy is under no obligation to do so.  The Navy reserves the right to cancel this RFQ at any time or to reject any and all submissions prepared in response to the RFQ.  The RFQ does not commit the Government to contract for services, or to pay any costs incurred in preparation of any submission in response to the RFQ. 
All questions, clarification requests, and general information requests regarding the RFQ must be submitted, in writing, to Ms. Heather McGee, Realty Specialist, Asset Management, Attn: Code OPNEAM1-HM, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic, 9742 Maryland Ave., Norfolk, VA 23511-3095, or via email to heather.mcgee@navy.mil .

<SUBJECT>Severe Transportation Accident Technical Peer Review 
<SOLNBR>NRC-02-09-012
<RESPDATE>052109
<CONTACT>Aaron Alvarado, Phone 3014923630, Email aaron.alvarado@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Dr. Miles Greiner, of the University of Nevada-Reno, to perform an independent technical peer review of analyses completed by the NRC of severe transportation accidents involving long duration fires.  The period of performance will be from the date of award to August 31, 2010.  The NRC staff has reviewed historical transportation accidents involving long duration fires to ensure that transportation packages for radioactive materials would survive real-life accidents and that the regulations for fire resistance of packages in 10 CFR Part 71 are adequate.  The Division of Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation (SFST) has published several NUREG/CR reports on the reviews done of the Baltimore tunnel fire (that occurred in July, 2001) and the Caldecott Tunnel fire (that occurred in April, 1982).  Two severe transportation accidents are currently under review: The April 27, 2007, gasoline tanker truck accident on the Interstate 880/580 junction (the "MacArthur Maze") in Oakland, California and the October 12, 2007, series of collisions in an Interstate 5 truck by-pass tunnel (the "Newhall Pass") in Santa Clarita, California.  The results from these studies are expected to be available by the end of calendar year 2009.

Based on the staffs involvement with the radioactive material packaging and transportation community for over 30 years, no other member this community could be identified that has the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience in the area of thermal analysis of radioactive material transportation packages and spent nuclear fuel, the testing and modeling of severe fires, and the performance of transportation packages in severe, long duration fires than Dr. Greiner.  More importantly, none could be identified that has met the criteria for independence that Dr. Greiner has.  

The authority for negotiating on a sole-source basis is made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 which provides for limiting competition in those situations where the supplies or services are available from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690, Size Standard: $7.0B.  This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRCs needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address not later than 15 calendar days from the date this announcement appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.

GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: NATIONWIDE.

SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: SEE SUBCONTRACTING GOALS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN. 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, historic preservation specialists, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, reliability, federal building stewardship regulations, and reduced energy consumption; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values. 

The Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), renamed by Executive Order in 1999, is located in Washington DCs Presidential Park, immediately west of The White House. This National Historic Landmark (NHL) commands a unique position in both our national history and architectural heritage. Designed by Supervising Architect of the Treasury, Alfred B. Mullett, the EEOB was built between 1871-1888 to house the growing staff of the Departments of State, War, and Navy, and is considered among the best examples of French Second Empire architecture in the country. Restoration of interior building spaces began in 1983. Since then, main corridors, libraries, stairwell domes, stained glass rotundas, and certain offices have been restored. Originally known as the State, War, and Navy Building, the EEOB housed the three departments associated with formulating and conducting the nations foreign policy in the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth century  the period when the United States emerged as an international power. The building has housed many of the nations most significant diplomats, politicians and military leaders and has been the scene of many historic events. 

Due to its proximity to the White House, the EEOB houses a majority of the White House Staff offices.  The building houses the Office of Management and Budget, the National Security Council, White House Counsel, and numerous other offices critical to the Presidential Administration. The EEOB is currently undergoing a 3 phased multi-year modernization and security upgrade. As the modernizations programmatic requirements evolved, it became clear that a new ADA compliant security screening facility and entrance was needed for employees, guests, and dignitaries. However, the exact size, scope, and complexity of the overall project are still under discussion and exploration. The numbers and figures described in this pre-solicitation notice are based on government estimates and projections.  GSA realizes that these numbers are subject to change. Due to the constraints of this project, its complex environment, historic preservation requirements, and the potential impact on contributing historical resources, GSA will require the services of our nations most talented lead designer for performance of architectural bridging design document services.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural bridging design document services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.

The proposed facility will be required to meet or exceed Federal energy goals. In addition, due to the sensitive nature of the work performed by EOP OA and USSS UD, the design of the facility and site must meet stringent federal security requirements. The screening facility will comply with PBS P100 (Facilities Standards for the Public Buildings Service), U.S. Building Codes, and U.S. Government requirements, including the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation, and associated design and landscape guidelines, as well as other applicable laws, codes, and standards.  The White House Security Guidelines and the United States Secret Services Technical Security Division have determined the classification level for this project. All judgments and proposed amendments to stated classification determinations must be presented to and approved by the United States Secret Service and White House Security.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: 

The project may provide approximately 800 GSF of new construction and adaptation of a National Historic Landmark. The intent of this project is to serve the needs of tenant agencies by providing a new ADA compliant building access and security screening facility. The new facility will function as a screening, credentialing, and holding area for employees, guests, and dignitaries wishing to gain entrance to the EEOB. A satisfactory outcome will meet tenant agency requirements with new construction that relates successfully to the surrounding urban landscape, architecture and historical context. The scope of architectural bridging design documents services will include: architecture; civil; historical preservation; interior design; urban site and landscape design; and a requirement for Design Excellence peer reviews and concept approval submission and presentation to the PBS Commissioner. Due to the sensitive nature of the proposed facilitys location and function, this Design Excellence opportunity will ONLY ADDRESS THE ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT of the facility. These Design Excellence architectural bridging design documents shall be categorized as Sensitive but Unclassified.   
(AMENDED 7 May 2009) All mechanical, electrical, plumbing, communications, IT, security, fire protection, physical security, and all other sensitive components of the facility will be integrated into the bridging design documents by the subsequent design-build firm, which is already under current contract with the Government.  Therefore the subsequent design-build firm, which holds proper facility clearances and the existing design contract with the government, will be utilized as an advisor for any coordination or implementation issues during the architectural bridging document development that involve classified systems or details. 

SCOPE OF WORK: 

(AMENDED 7 May 2009) The goals for this procurement are as follows: complete a client program evaluation defining the project and programmatic requirements and provide architectural bridging design document services. The design-build contractor, already under current contract with the Government, will use the architectural bridging documents as bases for a full design. This procurement is to address the architectural bridging design only and will not address classified systems, components, or processes. 

All conceptual/bridging design work will be required to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Department of Interior, Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation. Design submissions will include: an illustrated preservation report identifying all relevant design details, potential conflicts with the Secretary of the Interiors Standards and solutions for preventing all adverse effects, as defined in the NHPA, while achieving project goals. The Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO) must evaluate each design concept for compliance with all applicable preservation standards. The RHPO may request and coordinate additional design reviews based on their interpretation of each design submission. The lead designer and A/E team will 1. Participate in design consultations and presentations for project approvals by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts (CFA); 2. Fully engage tenants in the planning and design of the screening facility and its thoughtful integration into the EEOB, its historic landscape and urban context- the Presidential Park precinct; 3. Develop an architectural bridging design that maintains and enhances the existing cultural, natural, and physical attributes of the site; 4. Balance historic preservation with new construction, including the coexistence within the historic setting, and 5. Respect, incorporate, and interpret the significance of the Eisenhower Executive Office Buildings past, and that of Pennsylvania Avenue; 6. Subscribe to the Design Excellence goals; 7. Produce an architectural bridging design capable of achieving a level of sustainable design/green architecture for the facility that will meet or exceed the United States Green Building Councils (USGBC) Silver LEED rating; 8. Plan and design to promote reciprocal natural views and sightlines from Pennsylvania Avenue to the EEOB; 9. Engage a planning and design approach that explores opportunities which will accomplish preservation of adjacent historic setting and urban context and 10. Integrate basic operational and physical security elements within the Presidential Park precinct.

<AWARDEE>ROCKWOOD GENERAL CONTRACTORS, INC., 781 CALLE BENDITA, ARROYO GRANDE, CA 93420-5704 US
<DESC><p>The intent of this project is to repair runway shoulders in VAFB, CA. This project involves grinding out 2 inches of (CTB) concrete treated base, to make way for 2 inches of asphalt mix Type A. The shoulder width will extend to10 feet wide and 30,000 feet long. Before full production paving can start there will be a test strip paved 250 feet long and test sample will be taken for laboratory testing. Delineators will keep any one from traveling outside of the work area. The shoulder will need to be cleared and grubbed to remove any vegetation that will be generated from the shoulder work area. Through all of the tasks a pick up broom (sweeper) or kick broom will clean the edge of the runway when needed and the path way where the trucks run to clean any possible tracking. After the clearing then the removal of 2 inches of CTB will be taken down to meet the grade needed to establish a minimum 1 percent on a variable to 2 percent. Continue to finish grade shoulders, prep for asphalt pavement. Upon asphalt paving a tack coat will be applied to assure bonding, and then a layer of asphalt 2 inches thick will be applied. Work will include: Removing 2" CTB, Asphalt Construction; Clear and grub; Removing 2" CTB; Tack coat; Apply 2" minimum asphalt. Equip on Site: Skip and drag; 4000 gal Water truck; Motor grader; 2 rollers; Cat Paver; Asphalt grinder; Street Sweeper; 3 company vehicles (pickups), and Ten wheeler dump truck.</p>

, Washington, DC 20005 US
<DESC>FINDINGS


     The Federal Communications Commission has a need to provide digital television
     (DTV) media services to support the mandate by Congress for full-power broadcast 
     stations transmitting only in digital signals and no longer to transmit analog signals as 
     of  June 2009.

     The media support services will provide non-personal services that will support
     advertising and public relations in a variety of media services, publications, and  
     targeted distribution services that will expand consumer education and awareness
     regarding the transition to digital television.

    Full and open competitive procedures shall be used because the services required are 
    readily available in the commercial market place. The use of these procedures will
    allow for FCC to receive fair and reasonable prices to meet the needs of this
    requirement through competition. 

          The award date is May 5, 2009 for the base period and two (2) one-month option 
          periods.

DETERMINATION

I hereby determine that:

Due to the inability to definitively identify the labor classifications and number of labor hours needed to support the efforts needed for the DTV transition, it is literally impossible for the Government to establish a reasonable-independent cost estimate to serve as the basis of a firm-fixed-price contract.
     
Furthermore, and based market research and pre-solicitation meetings with various industry providers capable of providing this service, industry providers would be apprehensive (or non-responsive) in participating in this solicitation for fear that they would borne all financial risks of unanticipated labor cots, in the event the estimated volume of services exceed projections

As such, this solicitation specified a time and material/labor hour award as being the only means to meet the Governments requirement.  By doing this, offerors were allowed to be creative in their proposed-business solution to ensure only those human capitol resources that will actually be of value to the American taxpayer would be employed-eliminating waste and non-productivity. 

Hence, the use of a time and materials/labor-hour method of contracting is determined to be the best value and least costly.  That is because it is impracticable to secure services of this type (with an unknown quality of man-hours required). 

Since no desirable firm-fixed-price contract will suitability serve, the time and materials/labor hour contract was awarded based upon the following stipulations: 

A.	A limited period of performance has been established (i.e., less than 90  days) 
B.	Quality assurance and surveillance shall be conducted by the Government and Contractor management personnel to ensure inefficient and wasteful methods are not used by the contractor during the performance of the contract. 
C.	A contract ceiling of $3,500,000.00 has been established.
