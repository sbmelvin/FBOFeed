<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a)(1), with Radiation Solutions Inc. of Ontario, Canada, for the purchase three RSX-5/RS-500 digital airborne gamma radiation spectrometers.<br /><br />The National Weather Service (NWS), National Water Center (NWC) Airborne Gamma Survey Program conducts aerial snow survey operations in the snow-affected regions of the United States and Canada. During the snow season (January-April), snow water equivalent measurements are gathered over a number of the 2000+ pre-surveyed flight lines using a gamma radiation detection system mounted in the cabin of the aircraft. In the fall season, the same equipment is used to measure the soil moisture before snowfall is expected, and to measure the background radiation signature of new flight lines. During survey flights, this system is flown at 500 feet above the ground at ground speeds ranging between 100 and 120 knots. Gamma radiation emitted from the earth is attenuated by soil moisture in the upper 20 cm of soil and water mass in the snow cover. Through careful analysis, differences between airborne radiation measurements made over bare ground are compared to that of snow-covered ground. The radiation differences are corrected for airmass attenuation and extraneous gamma contamination from cosmic sources. The airmass correction is calculated using the output from precision temperature, radar altimeter, and pressure sensors mounted on and within the aircraft. Output from the Snow Survey system results in a mean areal snow water equivalent value within +/- one centimeter. Data collected during snow survey missions, including observed ground and weather conditions, are used by the National Weather Service (NWS) and other agencies to forecast river levels and potential flooding events due to snowmelt water runoff. Hydroelectric power interests and other water supply managers also use the data to regulate water storage and delivery.
<p><br />The systems currently being used are nearing the end of their life cycle, and Radiation Solutions Inc. (RSI) is uniquely qualified to provide form, fit function replacements for NOAA's aging equipment. The gamma radiation spectrometers have been integrated into the aircraft used to fly this equipment.  Such integration includes data inputs to the aircrafts pressure, temperature, radar altimeter, and GPS components. Custom racks used to house the spectrometers have been engineered into the aircraft and approved by the FAA.  Changes would be subject to custom design and FAA approval, a process which is both time consuming and costly.  Further, any changes to the power supplies or data feed locations would require new wiring and further alteration to the aircraft.  Finally, all associated software and hardware have evolved or been customized to fit the spectrometers currently in use.  The current software program, Airborne Gamma Data Acquisition Software (AGDAS), is designed to work with RSI's RadAssist software.  Introducing a new spectrometer would result in an additional requirement to procure a completely new software program. To ensure operational integrity, any new system would then be subject to testing.  All NOAA aircraft are operational, and aircraft are not available for pure testing purposes.  As such, it is not feasible to replace the gamma radiation spectrometers with a product other than what can be provided by RSI.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements, they may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis.  Information clearly articulating the ability to meet the below salient characteristics shall be provided.  A rough order of magnitude must also be provided.  All documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.<br /><br />Minimum salient characteristics include the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	The spectrometer must have 1024 channel output with optionally selectable 512 or 256 channel output within the energy spectra of gamma-ray sources.<br />&bull;	The system must allow connection of an unlimited number of detection crystals without spectral degradation. The system shall support a minimum of four 4L NaI(Tl) down looking detection crystals and one 4L NaI(Tl) up looking detection crystal. <br />&bull;	The system must permit data throughput of 250,000 counts per second (cps) per crystal detector.<br />&bull;	The vendor must provide hardware and software training for system operators.<br />&bull;	The system shall include dedicated software including graphical user interface, system diagnostics and error messaging.  The system software shall allow integration with external aircraft data inputs including pressure, temperature, radar altimeter and GPS.  The vendor must provide source code and data formats.<br />&bull;	The system shall have extensive self-diagnostic capabilities.<br />&bull;	Detector case must be rated for +/- 18G loading in X, Y and Z axes.<br />&bull;	System Physical characteristics:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	All system components shall be self contained and co-located in the crystal container, with the exception of vendor-provided software to be run on an external customer-provided computer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	The system shall include a detachable rack to be attached to the crystal container for mounting of external customer- provided computer.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	The rack or crystal container shall include an FAA compliant aircraft rated static inverter to provide 115vac power from six outlets required for powering peripheral equipment drawing between 10 and 15 amps.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	The container should have handles to facilitate manual movement.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	The size of the crystal container shall be smaller than (30Lx24Wx14H inches).<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	The maximum size of the integrated rack and crystal container shall be smaller than 30Lx24Wx26H inches.<br />&bull;	The system must be specifically designed for aviation use and must not be constructed with laboratory-grade equipment or parts normally used for static laboratory applications or other mobile non-aviation purposes. <br />&bull;	Must have a performance history for the specific purpose of airborne data collection.  <br />&bull;	Actual temperature testing of the entire detector package, from -20 degrees centigrade to +50 degrees centigrade, is required for functional verification and quality assurance prior to purchase by NOAA.</p>

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Computer Intelligence Association (CIA), located in Potomac, MD for Adobe Creative Cloud site licenses via an Enterprise Term Licensing Agreement (ETLA) licensing structure offered to the Maryland Educational Enterprise Consortium (MEEC) member schools.
<p>These site licenses will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p>FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p>(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p>(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p>The mission of USU is to provide the highest quality education programs in the health sciences to those selected individuals who demonstrate dedication to a health profession career in the Uniformed Services.  As such, it is essential USU provide the necessary training, equipment and resources for our students to become successful doctors and nurses and to be able to provide the best care possible for our soldiers and to support our research efforts. <br /> <br />The Adobe Creative Cloud for members of MEEC include access for USU faculty, staff and students to the latest Adobe creative applications and services as listed:</p>
<p>&bull;	Design Tools (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Bridge, Adobe Extension Manager, Adobe InCopy, Adobe XI Pro); <br />&bull;	Web Tools (Adobe Dreamweaver Adobe Flash Professional, Adobe Flash Builder Premium Edition, Adobe Fireworks); <br />&bull;	Video and audio tools (Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Audition, Adobe SpeedGrade, Adobe Prelude, Adobe Encore, Adobe Media Encoder); <br />&bull;	Creative Cloud Exclusive (Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, Adobe Muse, Adobe Edge Animate, Adobe Edge Inspect, Adobe Code Preview, Adobe Edge Reflow, Adobe Edge Web Fonts, Adobe Scout, Cloud Storage, Collaboration Tools).<br /> <br />This subscription also includes enterprise deployment tools, new features and upgrades as soon as the products become available. <br /> <br />USU's Adobe enterprise license covers campus installations and two work from home installations for faculty, staff and students.  Over 2,500 faculty, staff and students must be able to execute the mission of USU daily utilizing "standard" desktop software products for campus, personal and work at home use. To fulfill requirements to update all University wide Adobe software products, a site license is needed to apply designated software upgrades/patches across the network. There are no other vehicles that provide these products and services at the reduced academic pricing of $45 per seat.</p>
<p>MEEC selected Digital Information Services (DIA) dba Computer Intelligence Associates (CIA) through a competitive bid process to sell Adobe Creative Cloud ETLAs to MEEC member schools in good standing.</p>
<p>MEEC is the only organization of its kind and membership in this organization enhances the mission of USUHS.  For these reasons MEEC's Adobe Creative Cloud reseller, CIA, is the only source reasonably available to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.  Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.  Responses must be received via email to carolyn.randolph@usuhs.edu by 5:00 p.m. EST on 26 August 2015.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.
