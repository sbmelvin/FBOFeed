<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY FOR THE REPAIRS AND OPERATOR TRAINING FOR SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (SUAS) IN SUPPORT OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP)


NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING AND EITHER MAILED, FAXED OR EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING SPECIALIST.  CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW.

This is a market survey for information and comments from industry that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for the repairs and operator training for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS) in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The draft requirements are identified in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâs expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest, capabilities, and rough orders of magnitude (cost estimates) from businesses interested in and capable of providing the required services per the Statement of Work (SOW). Respondents to this Market Survey are encouraged to provide comments regarding the governmentâs approach to this requirement.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS â 336413, Other Aircraft Part and Auxiliary Equipment Manufacturing
Size Standard â 1,250 Employees

Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires interested vendors to address the requirements in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). This document is provided for feedback and comments.

Each vendor should include the following information along with their submission:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:

- Provision of the same services as listed in the SOW that have been provided by your firm

- Previous contracts and awards for these services (elaborate: quantities, dollar amounts and provide detailed information and past performance)

- Number of years in business

2. Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the services as listed in the draft SOW, including:

-	Please clearly state if you can fully support parts needed for all identified UAS systems.
-	Please clearly state if you currently possess, or can obtain prior to performance, all data needed to maintain and repair all UAS systems.
-	Please state if you can provide the training identified for all UAS systems IAW SOW para. 3.2. 
-	Please state if completion times for minor/medium/major repairs stated in SOW Attch 1 are reasonable expectations. Explain why if not. 
-	Please state if you can provide adequate depot and storage facilities and shipping capabilities for the drones.

3. Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

4. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) or budgetary estimate for the items described in the draft SOW.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 p.m. Central Time (Oklahoma Time) on February 1, 2018.

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet.  Please feel free to use the FBO site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.</p>
<p>Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Crane, IN intends to award a sole-source contract to NAMMO RAUFOSS AS, Raufoss, Norway for MK314 ammunition, 40mm Programmable High Explosive Dual Purpose (P-HEDP) High Velocity Grenade.  This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The resulting award has a 5-year ordering period, with an addition of five, one-year option CLINs, for a potential ten year contract award, with a minimum contract quantity of 1,895 rounds and maximum contract value of $35,000,000.  The Government's delivery requirement is 13,000 rounds due 90 days after receipt of delivery order.  The basis for restricting competition is the Government does not own the data rights to this item and does not plan to purchase the data rights from Nammo.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplicate costs, testing, procurement, evaluation, and certification costs which is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This acquisition is under North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) 332993 - Ammunition (except Small Arms) Manufacturing.  Delivery terms are FOB Destination.  Inspection and Acceptance will be performed at Source by a DCMA representative and/or NSWC Crane representative.</p>
<p>This effort will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, &lsquo;Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  The basis for restricting competition is the fuze design (MK444) used in the MK314 cartridge was exclusively developed by NAMMO and contains unique features that are required for use in the MK47 Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL).  The MK444 fuze was specifically designed for the MK47 ALGL which uses an AN/PWG-1 grenade launcher sight providing full weapon system capability.  The programming interface between the AN/PWG-1 sight and MK444 fuze is proprietary to NAMMO.  The full capability of the MK314 is only available when employed with the MK47 ALGL.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of testing, procurement, evaluation, and certification costs, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.</p>
<p>The proposed action is for supplies which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received in response to this synopsis will normally not be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) and the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the controlled attachments. Offerors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the internet at https://www.sam.gov.

<DESC>This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to Girolami Controls Incorporated, 547 Lepine, Dorval, Quebec, Canada for engineering services to upgrade thirteen (13) Electronic Control Assemblies (ECAs). The contract effort is to upgrade thirteen (13) Electronic Control Assemblies (ECAs), part number 123162-1. Additionally, support documentation consisting of ECA software source code (P-code) and installation/application instructions, ECA Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Gerber files used in fabrication of the custom circuit boards, and ECA associated Drawings, and Schematics (Circuit Board and System Interfaces) are being acquired. This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures with a total estimated value of $175,000. The Government's minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and requirements personnel. The contract action will be funded with Fiscal Year 2019 (FY19) Operation and Maintenance, Navy (OMN) funds. Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of theproposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).<br />This procurement is sole source for the following reasons. Girolami Controls built the Engine Control Assembly (ECA) for the MK-105 MOD 4 Influence Sweep System. Additionally, Girolami Controls an Engine Simulator Test Set to troubleshoot the ECA. The Navy only owns Source Control Drawings of this weapons replaceable assembly (WRA). The upgrade of these assets are beyond U.S. Navy capability and can only be upgraded by the original equipment<br />manufacturer (OEM). Girolami Controls Incorporated is the OEM for these items. As the OEM,<br />Girolami Control is the only company with the in-house resident knowledge to properly upgrade<br />the ECA units. Use of another company to attempt the upgrades may introduce new or change<br />existing parameters that may damage the MK-105 MOD4 system. Therefore, it is imperative<br />that these upgraded items are provided by Girolami Controls immediately the correct a shortfall<br />of spares for the U.S. Navy. The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the<br />lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to<br />meet the Government's needs. No additional market research was conducted because it is not practical, for the reasons<br />discussed in paragraph 4 above, for any company other than Girolami Controls, the OEM of the<br />ECAs to provide the required upgrades and support documentation. This requirement will be<br />synopsized in the government point of entry fbo.gov.<br />Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available.

<p><br />Waggl, Inc.<br />3 Harbor Dr Ste 200<br />Sausalito, CA, 94965-1491</p>
<p>Waggl is an online dynamic pulsing platform that allows for rapid development of surveys, immediate distribution and real-time results observation through a streamlined cloud-based portal. Competing survey platforms are generally more expensive, require longer term survey development and produce results only after all data is collected, cleaned and analyzed. Waggl allows for faster response to realized workforce issues and quicker response to mitigate risks to culture, morale and productivity. To prove the relevance of increased workforce insights to the organizational decision making process and to stimulate increased confidence in the organization, rapid deployment means responding faster to pressing workforce issues or concerns.</p>
<p>PSC/OD currently has a contract with Waggl. This contract for FOH will ensure that FOH is operating in line and consistent with PSC.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a dedicated employee feedback tool to easily and inexpensively engage, collect and assess employee sentiment on programs and policies to inform executive level workforce decision making and improve overall organizational culture and annual employee satisfaction scores.</p>

<p>The scope of the project is as follows:</p>
<p>MIT LL is a federally funded research and development center chartered to apply advanced technology to problems of national security. The project scope of work described herein involves the construction of a new Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microelectronics Integration Facility on the MIT LL campus, which is located at Hanscom Air Force Base in Lexington, Massachusetts. The Compound Semiconductor Laboratory and Microelectronics Integration Facility consists of approximately 162,000 gross square feet (GSF) of new laboratory and office space which includes a Clean Room complex for use by the Advanced Technologies Division of MIT LL. The intent of the CSL is to consolidate MIT LL's existing compound semiconductor materials growth, fabrication and characterization facilities. The intent of the MIF is to consolidate and enhance MIT LL's facilities for the fabrication and packaging of specialized advanced electronic prototypes.</p>
<p>The CSL-MIF is anticipated to be three stories, and constructed using concrete foundations, a steel and reinforced concrete superstructure, and energy efficient building systems, envelope, and roofing. The new building will be connected to other MIT LL buildings via a pedestrian connector bridge as part of this project. Specialized construction requirements include large and sophisticated clean rooms for microprocessor development and experimentation (the total clean room area under filter is approximately 35,000 net square feet, designed to Federal Standard (FED STD) 209E Class 10/International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Class 4 standards); associated complex HVAC and electrical requirements; secure communications areas; hazardous, toxic, and corrosive process liquid and gas storage, transport, distribution and associated waste collection systems; and a structural foundation system that minimizes vibrations and noise in the clean room areas. The facility will be constructed to meet Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technology (IEST) standards for vibration control (VC) to VC-C/D with select portions to VC-E. Required support process utilities include the following: Equipment Cooling Water (ECW), Clean Dry Air (CDA), three (3) grades of gaseous nitrogen (N2), Liquid Nitrogen (LN2), Process Vacuum (PVAAC), Ultra-Pure Water - semiconductor grade (UPW), 120/208/480V single-phase and three-phase power with UPS, liquid waste treatment (pH adjustment), and abatement of hazardous exhaust streams.</p>
<p>The CSL-MIF is to be located on an existing paved parking lot that contains a cluster of trees in the center and is surrounded by other structures and as such is considered a constrained site. The site slopes from south to north with a change in grade of approximately 28 feet. Site improvements will include demolition of 5 buildings, expansion of the main chiller plant, providing a new feed from the main electrical distribution plant, access roads, replacement parking, relocation of existing utilities and new utility connections, landscaping, and all other work necessary to make this a complete and usable project. Facilities are being designed as permanent construction in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 1-200-01, General Building Requirements. This project will comply with DoD antiterrorism/force protection requirements per UFC 4-010-01, sustainability principles in accordance with UFC 1-200-02, and High Performance and Sustainable Building Requirements. Note that installation of laboratory-owned equipment and high-value tool sets will be completed by others. This project is on a secure DoD facility and involves sensitive information; all members of the contractor's team who work on this project must be US citizens and will be subject to a background check.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposals at this time. The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about late February, 2019. Neither telephonic nor faxed requests of this solicitation will be accepted.  The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).

Factor 1, Technical Approach: Provide a brief narrative (page limitation: three pages for brief narrative) describing the Offeror s method to manage the project to achieve design and construction design objectives as described in the solicitation. If the page limits are exceeded, the pages in excess of the limit will not be read or considered. Include at minimum all aspects covered in the scope of work.

Factor 5: Past Performance: Each proposal shall provide current and relevant information regarding an Offeror s actions under previously awarded contracts referenced under Factor 2, Experience.  If a completed past performance evaluation is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), it shall be submitted with the proposal for each project referenced in Factor 2, Experience.  If there is not a completed past performance evaluation available in PPIRS, then the Offeror shall submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (reference attachment 2) for each project referenced in Factor 2, Experience. The Offeror shall notify their client that the PPQ shall be submitted via email to the Government s point of contact William.henkel@va.gov.

Acceptable is defined as the Offeror demonstrated the ability to meet all of the Government s minimum requirements as identified in the solicitation. Unacceptable is defined as the Offeror failed to demonstrate the ability to meet all of the Government s minimum requirements as identified in the solicitation.  Minimum requirements are defined as the offeror s methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined and satisfied the requirements of the solicitation.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The democratization of technology has allowed adversarial nations to gain relative parity in technology and capability placing U.S. forward operating airfields at risk of attack. To counter this threat, the U.S. Air Force needs the ability to rapidly deploy forces in all weather conditions to ensure freedom of movement, commitment to our partners and demonstration of our resolve. Advanced enemy capabilities directly impact the Air Force's ability to operate in contested areas and are known as Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD) environments. These advanced capabilities include Integrated Air Defense Systems, denied or contested electromagnetic environments and potential missile threats to forward-operating locations. Adaptive Basing is an emerging concept of operations (CONOPs) that calls for Agile Disaggregation (or dispersal) that divides operational units into geographically dispersed subunits conducting operations coordinated in time and space. These subunits are more agile if they can shift their operating bases or locations quickly and unpredictably. This requires significant resilience and mobility of combat forces. The need for mobility and agility places pressure on planners to reduce the military footprint and potentially take significant risks in the interest of speed.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">Air Traffic Control and Landing System (ATCALS) provides vital mission support to enable USAF forces to deliver responsive and effective global vigilance, global reach and global power. ATCALS must respond to the joint operational need to deploy, employ, sustain, and redeploy aviation assets in multiple geographically separated and environmentally diverse regions at will.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in; mso-add-space: auto"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The USAF Expeditionary ATC Technology Development effort seeks to manage the risks by iterative experimentation on the requirements trade space to rapidly develop and field expeditionary ATC capabilities to the warfighters by leveraging current and emerging technologies in radar, automation, network and communication. A small footprint precision approach capability is the first technology development effort.</span></p>

The RALT transmits and receives at 4.4GHz, which can only be realized by using discrete and switchable fiber optic delay lines of 1.0167usec, 10.167usec, 0usec, and 11.1837usec. The accuracy of these delay lines needs to be within 1%. In order to work with the existing test stand control interface used to switch between the fiber optic delay lines, the simulator needs to use two open/28Vdc control lines. 519 SMXS requires selected delay values displayed by LED indicators and switching time of &lt;100msec. The RF input/output characteristics need to be as follows:</span></p>

SELECTION CRITERIA & DESCRIPTIONS
The selection criteria descriptions are provided below. 
PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS NECESSARY FOR SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE OF REQUIRED SERVICES. 
Provide brief resumes of proposed team members who will specifically serve as the Project Managers and Designers of Record. The Designers of Record shall perform and direct the design within their respective discipline and shall sign and seal the drawings. All Designers of Record must be professionally registered in their discipline. Each resume shall include a minimum of two (2) specific completed projects that best illustrate the individual team members experience relevant to this contract scope;
SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE
Specialized experience and technical competence required for this specific project, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
CAPACITY
This factor evaluates the ability of the firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the possible myriad of design projects in the required time. 
The general workload and staffing capacity of the design office will be evaluated.
List current projects with a design fee of greater than $20,000 being designed in the firms  office. 
Indicate the firms  present workload and the availability 
of the project team (including sub-consultants) for the specified contract performance period;
Describe experience in successfully delivering projects per 
performance schedule, providing timely construction support, and successfully completing multiple projects with similar delivery dates
PAST PERFORMANCE: VISN 2 will evaluate past performance on recent and relevant contracts with government agencies (emphasis on VA work) and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and a record of significant claims against the firm due to improper or incomplete engineering services (references required). 
Recent is defined as performance occurring within 5 years of the date of this Sources Sought, except that ongoing projects must have begun no less than one (1) year prior to the issuance of this Sources Sought.
Relevancy is defined as performance of work on projects that are similar in scope to the types of projects anticipated under the resultant contracts.
Respondents with no previous past performance shall state this when addressing the selection criteria. Where there is no record of past performance, the proposal will be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation.
Submission Requirements: 
Submit a minimal of three (3) references; any of the following evaluations are acceptable:
Contractor Performance Assessment Report System (CPARS), or 
Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project submitted under Criterion 2.
If a completed CPARS evaluation is available, it shall be submitted with the completed SF330 package. If there is not a completed CPARS evaluation, the PPQ included with this notice is provided for the Offeror or its team members to submit for each project included in criterion (2). If a PPQ is submitted, but an official CPARS evaluation is found for that project in government databases, the official evaluation will take precedence. If a CPARS evaluation is not available, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for each contract customer/reference. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF330. If the A-E is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a contract customer/reference for a project before the response date set forth in this notice, the A-E should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment #1), including contract and point of contact information for the respective projects. 
A-Es should follow-up with references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. At the reference s request, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government point of contact at the Network Contracting Office (NCO) 2 Attn: Ms. Mitchelle Labady, Contracting Officer, via email at Mitchelle.Labady@va.gov, prior to the response date. A-Es shall not incorporate by references into their response CPARS or PPQ evaluations previously submitted in response to other A-E services procurements. However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. Submitted CPARS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30-page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document
LOCATION
The A/E Firm proximity to the VA NJ HCS, 385 Tremont Ave, East Orange, NJ 07018 is an evaluation criterion. 
This distance is determined according to http://maps.google.com/
This factor evaluates the distance the AE firm's design office or offices lies from the location of work.  Please provide the address (es) and distance of your closest office to the address listed below.  
 (6) Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, General Management, and cooperativeness.
 (7) Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.  
 (8) Specific Experience and Qualifications of personnel proposed assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
PLEASE NOTE: The AE Evaluation Board must be provided with complete and accurate information for ALL eight (8) evaluation factors above in order to rank as qualified and eligible firms. Therefore, the AE firm must expand upon, as it deems necessary, on any evaluation factor not well demonstrated or addressed with Part 1A to Part IG and Part II of the SF330. The AE firm shall use Part IH and/or use additional sheets to supplement/address all evaluation factors to clearly demonstrate its qualifications.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span>:  An important mandate of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is to develop new treatments for cancer. In a highly integrative approach, the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch (LYMB) of the NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) utilizes recombinant molecules produced by NCI's Biopharmaceutical Development Program and commercial agents as potential immune system modulators. The LYMB Clinical Trials Team coordinates several phase I/phase II clinical trials under protocols that have been approved by the NCI's Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the study of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). The LYMB's current portfolio consists of the following protocols:<br />&bull;	NCT01712659: "Phase I/II Trial Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Ruxolitinib in Patients with Smoldering or Chronic Adult T-Cell Leukemia (ATL)."<br /><br />&bull;	NCT02689453: "Subcutaneous Recombinant Human IL-15 (rhIL-15) and Alemtuzumab for People with Refractory or Relapsed Chronic and Acute Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL)."<br /><br />&bull;	NCT00001582: "Collection of Blood, Bone Marrow, and Tissue Samples for Investigation of the Human Immune Response, Lymphoma Biology and HTLV-1 Infection."</p>
<p><em>(Detailed information about each of the above listed trials is public information and can be accessed by visiting clinicaltrials.gov and searching by NCT number).</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose/Requirements:</span> The overarching goal of LYMB's clinical trials is to improve the understanding and treatment of ATL. ATL is a rare and highly aggressive lymphoproliferative disease that results from chronic infection with the retrovirus Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 is most pervasive in the Caribbean basin-specifically Jamaica-where the majority of ATL cases reside. Access to this population is crucial to the success of LYMB's study; therefore, LYMB requires a contractor with a strong presence in Jamaica that is capable of effectively identifying, diagnosing and referring ATL patients to LYMB's protocols.</p>
<p>Scope: Identify, diagnose, refer and provide ongoing administrative support to current and prospective patients residing in Jamaica for new and existing ATL-related protocols.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements:</span> Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, materials, supplies, equipment, needed to perform the following:</p>
<p>Task 1. Refer Potential Study Participants.<br />1.1	Identify and interact with the target outpatient or inpatient population within Jamaica.<br />1.2  Diagnose ATL and screen for prospective study participants (residing in Jamaica) who meet the criteria specified by LYMB's various clinical trial protocols (listed above) and new trials as identified by LYMB staff.<br />1.3	Refer potentially eligible candidates (residing in Jamaica) and forward their medical records to the staff in LYMB, CCR, NCI. LYMB staff will decide on candidate eligibility after review of the records and inform the contractor whether the patient should initiate travel arrangements to come to the NCI for screening and possible enrollment.</p>
<p>Task 2. Provide Ongoing Administrative Support. <br />2.1	Provide administrative support for the travel of patients (residing in Jamaica) selected for inclusion in NCI clinical trials. Contact LYMB's Patient Care Coordinator to coordinate participant (residing in Jamaica) travel to the National Institutes of Health's Clinical Center located in Bethesda, MD, United States. This support shall include, but is not limited to, coordinating travel arrangements with the LYMB Patient Care Coordinator, providing transportation schedules, and assisting patients with directions to and from the Clinical Center.<br />2.2	Provide administrative and financial support in obtaining valid documents required to enter the United States to participants (residing in Jamaica) selected to travel to the Clinical Center. This support includes, but is not limited to, submitting applications for passports and visas. (International travel and travel within the United States will be arranged and paid for by the Government).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated period of performance:</span> Base period of 12 months (11/1/2019 - 10/31/2020), with four (4) 12-month option periods.</p>

SCOPE OF WORK: The general scope of this project is to design to improve the ground water infiltration systems at the Batavia VAMC..

GENERAL

The Architectural and Engineering Firm (hereafter referred to as A/E) shall provide Part 1, (Design Services), and Part 2 (Construction Period Services) associated with the development of drawings and specifications to Improve Groundwater Infiltration System Design at the VA Western NY Healthcare System (VAWNYHS), Batavia Campus, 222 Richmond Avenue Batavia, NY 14020 (hereafter referred to as Batavia VAMC). These services shall include developing all drawings, phasing/impact on the medical center, and comprehensive construction cost estimate necessary for all required work. The period of performance for part 1 services is 215 days. 

The A/E is responsible for the development of an independent construction estimate for construction bidding.  The A/E shall advise the Contracting Officer (hereafter referred to as CO) in writing if the anticipated cost of the project is considerably different from the government estimate.

Access to the VA shall be coordinated through the VA Contracting Officers Representative (VA COR).  There are locations on the campus, including but not limited to Building 30, that are very sensitive and the VA COR will have to gain permission for access approximately 1 week in advance. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

The Batavia VAMC is requesting design services and preparation of construction documents (drawings, specifications and cost estimates) for construction services to improve the design of the existing groundwater infiltration system for the Women s Center for Hope, Building 30.  The existing system was installed in 2015 to control the groundwater elevation at Building 30 to prevent flow of groundwater into the basement.  This is necessary because the natural groundwater elevation is above the elevation of the constructed basement floor.  The existing system includes an underground pumping system adjacent to Building 30 and a conveyance system consisting of buried pipe which is connected to an infiltration bed located approximately 150 feet southeast of the building.  

However, the existing infiltration bed is currently not capable of accepting the total volume of groundwater flow from the pumping system.  The portion of groundwater that the infiltration bed cannot handle is discharged to the ground surface adjacent to the infiltration field via an overflow pipe.  The operation of the overflow on a regular basis is not acceptable because of the accumulation of groundwater at the ground surface.  The original design identified the overflow feature as an emergency feature, and, therefore, not intended for routine use.

Thus, the purpose of this design improvement project is to increase the ability to accommodate the total discharge volume from the Building 30 pumping system in an environmentally responsible manner that is compliant with all applicable local, state, and federal regulations.
The A/E will consider reasonable methods for accomplishing this purpose and review and evaluate them.  The A/E will also perform a physical evaluation of the existing infiltration system to determine if there are problems (e.g., siltation or blockage(s) or low permeability) that may have resulted in reduced infiltration below its intended design capacity.  The A/E will consider whether expansion of the existing infiltration field or conveyance of a portion or total volume of the pumped groundwater to another location such as the storm the water sewer system (if local, state and federal codes allow) or surface water feature is needed to accommodate the total volume of groundwater discharge. 

Design Parameters*
 
The A/E will conduct necessary field testing (e.g., infiltrometer) and perform flow rate calculations (e.g., current and design) and computer modeling necessary to support improvements to the groundwater infiltration system design and achieve adequate rates of infiltration into the subsurface infiltration field without resulting in routine system overflow discharge or excessively wet ground surface conditions.  Note that previous infiltrometer testing was limited to two infiltrometers within the boundary of the current infiltration field and this may not have been sufficient to properly characterize the subsurface conditions.  Thus, the A/E will conduct testing at a sufficient number of locations and to adequately characterize the subsurface conditions and provide an accurate infiltration model.     

The A/E will evaluate the option to connect the existing pipe conveyance to the City of Batavia (hereafter referred to as  the City ) Storm Sewer System, either separate from or in addition to the infiltration field.  The A/E will communicate with the City and determine its requirements from VA for such a connection.  The A/E will also evaluate conveyance from the underground pumping system to other existing onsite sewers which discharge at the north portion of the VA property.  

The A/E will evaluate the option to install additional subsurface piping to convey the groundwater from the underground pumping system to the existing pond directly north of the Batavia VAMC campus.  VA has previously deeded this pond to the City.  Therefore, if this option is selected, then the A/E will assist VA in obtaining permission from the City and regulatory agencies with jurisdiction to discharge the groundwater to the pond.
 
*Note that the A/E will provide VA Facilities Engineering and Environmental Departments with a preliminary design presentation, including specifics associated with above options and any other feasible options to achieve the project purpose.  The purpose of this presentation will be for VA to select the desired option for further design development.  If no feasible options are presented at that time, the A/E will further identify a feasible option(s).  If no feasible options are identified by the A/E, then the VA will have the option to discontinue the project at that time.

The resulting design included the installation of a groundwater pump station located underground and adjacent to the exterior of the south wall of the Building 30 basement.  The pump station is located near the southeast corner of the building near the location of the interior sump pumps.  The exterior pumping station consists of a concrete-lined manway accessed at the ground surface via a vault-type cover.  It contains two industrial pumps which work in a cyclic manner to maintain groundwater elevations below an elevation set point below the elevation of the basement floor.  Under normal conditions, continuous pumping is not needed to maintain the desired groundwater elevation.  Typically, when one pump lowers the groundwater to the lower set point, it then shuts off and the other pump turns on after delay and when the groundwater rises to the upper elevation set point.  Thus, the pumps cycle back and forth and do not run concurrently or continuously.  The interior sump pumps are also controlled with high and low elevation set points and serve as backup if the exterior pumps fail.

Groundwater from the exterior pump station (and interior sump pumps if used) is conveyed via underground piping to the infiltration field approximately 150 feet to the southeast.  The outside dimensions of the infiltration field are approximately 103 feet in length X 41 feet wide.  The subsurface construction of the infiltration field was specified as twelve arched-plastic chambers approximately 16 inches high by 34 inches wide (at base) by 90.7 inches long placed (overlapping) end to end and surrounded by Â¾ - 2 inch, clean, crushed, angular stone placed over AASHTO M288 Class 2 non-woven geotextile.  The depth specified for installation of the infiltration bed was a minimum of 44 inches and a maximum of 118 inches below ground surface.   

VA will provide the A/E with drawings showing construction specifications for the existing pump station, conveyance piping, and infiltration field prior to the commencement of the improved design.  The A/E will be responsible for the development of design improvements based on the former  Women s Health Center Groundwater Management  design project and drawings and will update these drawings accordingly.  The revised drawings will show the planned maintenance and infrastructure improvements needed to achieve infiltration and/or other conveyance volume needed to adequately control groundwater elevations and prevent the flow of groundwater into the basement of Building 30 without adverse environmental or surface impacts.
 
The A/E shall thoroughly review the above plan and all information therein and identify data gaps and/or the need to obtain further field testing, modeling, or other information to accomplish the above design parameters for the improved design.  The A/E shall perform the work accordingly to fill these data gaps and fully support the preparation of the improved design.

The A/E shall also review all existing design / bid drawings relating to the construction of the current system.   
       
Site Survey

Pre-Bid: The A/E will conduct a brief pre-bid site survey of pertinent areas of the campus.  This survey will be arranged through the CO.  Members of the VA Facilities Engineering and Environmental Departments will accompany the A/E during the pre-bid survey.  The A/E will have access to VA s limited design drawings under supervision of the COR.  However, the drawings shall not leave the document room unless under supervision or with written permission by the COR.

Award: The A/E awarded the project will provide further survey of portion(s) of the campus that are relevant to the improved design of the groundwater design improvements.  The additional survey will be coordinated through the VA COR.

Buried Utility Survey

The AE shall conduct a buried utility survey and document the presence of these systems on the construction documents for any proposed path of underground systems.  These systems shall be clearly identified to the construction contractors in the design documents prior to construction bidding.  This survey is typically conducted with ground penetrating radar or another approved means.  The existing site utilities are NOT well documented on this campus.
  
Design Drawings

The A/E will develop design drawings that show the improved groundwater details in AutoCAD format.  The A/E will develop and present the drawings for VA review at 30%, 60%, 90% and 100% levels of design as described in further detail in Section C.  Scope of Work, Part 1 Services further below.

As Built Drawings  

The AE will generate as-built drawings of the final construction of the final improved groundwater design construction.  The existing design drawings that Cannon Design developed for the Women  Mental Health Center Groundwater Management Project will be incorporated into the as built drawings where appropriate.  Portions of the as-built drawings that are based on the previous design drawings will be identified as such (i.e., based on design not as-built drawings).  The A/E will provide the as-built drawings from the improved design construction in AutoCAD and PDF format.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground, Research Triangle Park Contracting Division (ACC-APG, RTP), on the behalf of Army Futures Command (AFC) intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, to the University of Texas at Austin. This purchase will be made under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition as authorized by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract lies solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.
<p>The University of Texas at Austin is a unique source of information and expertise on<br />the Innovative Readiness (IR) Program for over 20 years. The IR Program will ready Army Future Command (AFC) staff to hit the ground running with essential knowledge, basic practice and broad relationships built with the Austin entrepreneurial community. Technologies for participant review will be provided by the Austin Technology Incubator company cohort and The University of Texas at Austin technologies for licensing. This approach will provide "live" technologies for participant learning lessons. The IC2 Institute will provide Masters of Science and Technology Commercialization (MSTC) students as online mentors for participants in the program with IC2 Institute staff oversight. The MSTC program uses the IR Program as their own "on-boarding" strategy to prepare students for this intense one-year Master's Program.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a Scalable program for melding online training with immersive in-Austin community engagement to establish a baseline of vocabulary and experience in technology commercialization among Army Futures Command staff. The world of innovation and entrepreneurship comes with its own vocabulary, methodologies, behaviors and jargon. These elements provide cohesion among ecosystem players. As the AFC builds a team in Austin and solidifies remote stakeholders around its mission, it will be important for all team members to understand key vocabulary and actively engage in moving the vocabulary into practice through introduction of active learning exercises. Further, linking this active learning with immersion in the Austin ecosystem offers a synergy - the team members can "speak the language" and "walk the talk" while also gaining an understanding of the structure and players in the Austin ecosystem while developing key relationships to facilitate their job performance, form agile teams and make decisions critical to AFC function.</p>
<p>Training will address both new technology development as well as pivoting civilian technologies for military application providing inspiration for in-military "intrapreneurship" and innovation. Three cohorts are proposed per year: Spring, Fall and Winter with approximately 15 students each session. The Program offers links to Austin incubation and acceleration programs as well as advanced training programs offered at The University of Texas at Austin. The IR Program is focused on broad vocabulary development and central methodology normalization for AFC employees and broader stakeholders, the Ecosystem Immersion portion will focus only on employee readiness and relationship building. Each of the five Ecosystem Immersion sessions will be held at a different innovation/entrepreneurship hub in Austin to expand the network and interactions for Army Futures Command participants. A selected Core Concept will be presented with active learning lessons to broaden the knowledge of AFC participants and build AFC-community team collaborations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The mission of the AFSC is to sustain weapon system readiness to generate airpower for America. The center provides war-winning expeditionary capabilities to the warfighter through world-class depot maintenance, supply chain management and installation support. Utilizing the technology of automated cabinets within industrial/production facilities provides for better cost management, increases operational effectiveness, provides standardization throughout AFSC and aligns with Department of Defense (DoD) strategic sourcing initiatives. Automated POUIDE allows AFSC to electronically manage, monitor and track usage of Etool computers for technical orders compliance, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), hand tools, test measurement and diagnostic tools, shop supplies, Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) related items, and expendable items used throughout the production shops and office areas. Effective use of POUIDE requires communication of the individual machines through the Air Force network to allow the transmission of usage data from the machine to the secure server where all of the data is compiled.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Primary Contributing Factors Restricting Competition to Only One Source (FAR 6.302-1)</strong></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraph" style="margin-left: .25in; mso-add-space: auto;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common Platform to Support the Generation III (Gen III) Industrial Product-Support Vendor (IPV) Program</span>: As part of a strategic initiative, an enterprise decision to have a common platform for the Gen III IPV program, which enables rapid replenishment of consumable parts across the ALC&rsquo;s, was determined through the AFSC integration board. As part of the decision, the board mandated that an enterprise wide network solution be developed for the AutoCrib POUIDE system. The Information Technology (IT) Directors at each base in conjunction with the 24th Air Force Cybersecurity team was tasked to develop a single consolidated network solution that all three ALC&rsquo;s would use to connect the POUIDE systems. This network solution, AFCSnet, was developed utilizing AutoCrib Web services protocols with two way communications between the AF, DLA and the Gen III Contractor. AFCSnet allows program vendors, such as the Materiel Support Integrator (MSI) or IPV contractor, to communicate with the POUIDE machines and databases for even greater efficiencies. Additionally, the current $1.5B Gen III IPV contract (i.e. SPE4AX-17-D-9006; awarded 09 March 2017) was written around replacing the existing open bin concept with the new AutoCrib POUIDE.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Common Software for Machine-to-Machine and Machine-to-Database Communication</span>: Every manufacturer of automated cabinets and dispensing machines has their own proprietary version of software that operates their machines. Software from one manufacturer will not work with a POUIDE from a different manufacturer. As such, a single manufacturer of POUIDE is required in order for AFSC&rsquo;s strategic initiatives to be implemented and have the ability to manage the POUIDE program at the enterprise level. Otherwise there would be a mixture of POUIDE from different manufacturers, all operating on their own version of software, not communicating with each other effectively, and not sending consolidated demand and usage data to a single database.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Air Force Network Requirements</span>: AutoCrib.net (i.e. AutoCrib&rsquo;s proprietary software) is approved by Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) to run on the Air Force network, and is currently the only known point of use management software approved for the Air Force network. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>If another manufacturer&rsquo;s POUIDE were to be used, that manufacturer&rsquo;s software would have to receive Authority to Operate (ATO) via the Certification and Accreditation (C&amp;A) process in order to run on the Air Force network.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">POUIDE Capabilities Required</span>: Preliminary market research confirms there are other vendors whom manufacturer POUIDE; however, AutoCrib is the only POUIDE manufacture that can provide all the diverse types of POUIDE equipment that the AFSC requires. In the case of large scale POUIDE machines, such as the AutoCrib RoboCrib LX2000, the Government is not aware of another POUIDE company that manufactures a machine comparable in size or capacity. Additionally, market research did not find similar/comparable products for other variations of AutoCrib POUIDE, such as VLM, TX750, and ETOOL type machines, which are required by the AFSC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Substantial Duplication of Costs</span>: AFSC&rsquo;s current investment in AutoCrib specific products and associated network development costs between the three ALC&rsquo;s is over $29M. Additionally, there are approximately twenty seven thousand (27,000) users trained on AutoCrib POUIDE across the three ALC&rsquo;s today. Savings to offset the costs from the current investment, and costs to re-train users on another manufacturer POUIDE, is not expected to be recovered through competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>

This effort is anticipated to be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, one responsible source and no other supplies of services will satisfy agency requirements. The basis for restricted competition is due to substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the agency. However, a determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">A leader in child care reform, Navy CYP has aggressively responded to the requirements of the 1989 Military Child Care Act (MCCA) by raising the bar for quality expectations, increasing performance and outcomes criteria, and investing in critical resources including personnel, professional development, facilities, and technology.

<DESC>The Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General is developing a training program to address grantee and healthcare compliance for American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AI/AN) grantees and healthcare providers.  The training will include both in-person and online session.  The Government will provide participants with tools for creating, enforcing, and supporting grantee and healthcare compliance, understanding of the importance of internal controls, and the knowledge of key elements for ensuring quality of care and service delivery.  Following the completion of the program, the Government will measure the extent to which participants knowledge increased, and the extent to which they accessed and used the provided resources (i.e. toolkits etc.).  After the trainings and accessing online resources, providers and grantees should be better equipped to comply with federal grantee and healthcare compliance requirements and develop policies, procedures, and internal controls to prevent and detect fraud, mismanagement of funds, and improper billing.
<p>The Government is seeking a contractor(s) to perform various duties related to our grantee and healthcare compliance training.  The contractor(s) shall provide project management, marketing campaigns, logistics for up to four in-person trainings (including the ability to travel to training locations to execute in person), curriculum development for both in-person and online training resources, execution of online resources possibly to include website design, filming, and video editing, technical writing to draft and edit in-person training and online documents,  metric development and measurement, and other training associated tasks.</p>

As such, it is essential SPAWAR provide the necessary equipment and services required for our warfighters to be successful in these efforts.  SSC PAC has a WILMA Test Station for Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) that needs a Four (4) channel Satellite Link Emulator. This highly important procurement will simulate the link between MUOS radio terminals and MUOS ground system. In order to fully function, strict and non-negotiable criteria need to be met as follows:  Component 001 - The frequencies shall allow for communication from MUOS radio terminals to Radio Base Stations (RBSs), a component within the MUOS ground system.  Component 002 - The frequencies shall allow for communication from MUOS radio terminals to communicate to Radio Base Stations (RBSs), a component within the MUOS ground system.  Component 003  It shall have the ability to add delay to the signal is imperative to simulate the delay in communication to the MUOS satellite.  Component 004 - The lab environment must be able to simulate the entire MUOS UHF spectrum to meet testing requirements.  Component 005  Changing attenuation of channels is required to more accurately represent a satellite link between terminal and ground.  Component 006 - Both the General Dynamics Lab and the MUSIC Lab are used to test the MUOS waveform on software defined radios for MIL-STD-188-187A utilizing the same standardized equipment and test procedures to ensure the same results will be obtained at either location.  There are no alternatives for the imperative reason that the components and frequencies used in this testing are unique to SSC PAC MUOS architecture. Without a doubt, should another product was purchased without this precise and specific capability, the laboratory system will result in a breakdown, thus, non-functional.  This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received via email carmelo.nuestro1@navy.mil) by 02:00 p.m. PST on 01 February 2019.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Increase the Ceiling of Contract N66001-13-C-4025  This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-13-C-4025 to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), awarded by SSC Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Defense Sciences Office (DARPA/DSO) on 25 June 2013 for a performance period of three (3) years. The effort under the contract is to provide a platform for producing medical therapeutics in logistically challenging environments where the target product profile includes on-demand delivery of protein biologics in a rapid manner with limited access to clean water and support by a cold-chain.  This additional effort intends to add technical work that will leverage the program efforts to date. Specifically, the extension of work will continue to advance the MIT InSCyT benchtop platform and demonstrate its capability to produce purified clinical-grade catalytically inactive botulism haloproteins. This additional work develops a capability that is of interest to BARDA and would facilitate transition.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541715 (renumbered from 541712).  Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program, which has seen breakthroughs that will benefit from continued work under this current contract. It is expected that the technology will transition for use by the warfighter. This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $1.7M and an additional 24 months of performance. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes and will be posted for 15 days. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Jeannette Perez, Code 22720, SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-7918 or via email to jeannette.perez1@navy.mil.

<p align="left">(B) <em>The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. </em>A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay</p>

<p align="left">final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the</p>
<p align="left">taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p align="left">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has</p>
<p align="left">been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of</p>
<p align="left">Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the</p>
<p align="left">lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because</p>
<p align="left">the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not</p>
<p align="left">a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the</p>
<p align="left">taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p align="left">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making</p>
<p align="left">timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because</p>
<p align="left">the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p align="left">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced</p>
<p align="left">collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>Self assessment tools constitute a critical element of CES instructional material, the lack of which will hinder the learning experience and will compromise AMSC's mission. AMSC Basic and Advanced Course curricula requires students to complete a Learning Style Inventory (LSI) assessment.
<p>Additionally required for the Command and General Staff School, the School for Command Preparation, and the Army University's Faculty and Staff Development Division. The LSI is part of the CGSC Common Faculty Development Instructor Course Design. It is critical that our faculty and students understand learning style preferences for them to appreciate and implement the CGSC Experiential Learning Model.</p>
<p>Kolb LSI Workbook V3.1 (hard copy and online) are currently coded into the Learning Management System courses as noted above. Selection of another instrument would require redesign of the courseware. Due to the time requirements and cost involved, integration of an instrument other than the Kolb LSI into the current courseware is neither feasible nor in the best interests of the government.</p>

Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:

(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or
(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.

AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.

Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint.

At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas.

To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.

(2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.

<p>__________________________________________________________________________________<br />Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for<br />which the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after<br />January 1, 2017. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must<br />provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work,<br />up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use<br />paid sick leave for their own illness, injury or other health-related needs,<br />including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like<br />family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other health-related needs,<br />including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from, or to assist a family<br />member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of,<br />domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additional information on<br />contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at<br />www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.<br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per<br />month*</p>
<p>*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an<br />SCA-covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for<br />Federal Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA<br />obligations for any paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay<br />in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR<br />4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE<br />FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) Rates are applicable only under the appropriate occupational category.</p>
<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are<br />made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other<br />personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry<br />cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the<br />cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract,<br />by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement<br />that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p><br />** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **</p>
<p>Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the<br />Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes,<br />prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only<br />upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage<br />determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract,<br />adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective<br />bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that<br />Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under<br />section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage<br />determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits<br />paid under the predecessor contract.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which<br />is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the<br />work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished<br />the fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming<br />procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of<br />contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of<br />conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be<br />retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a<br />contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to<br />which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in<br />order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE)<br />for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for<br />proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or<br />disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or<br />where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This<br />report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days<br />after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a<br />report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the<br />Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to<br />process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond<br />paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in<br />the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required<br />tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage<br />determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or<br />subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>

<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<RESPDATE>020819
<CONTACT>Steven Baldomero, Assistant, Phone 8502307468, Email steven.baldomero2@navy.mil
<DESC>This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to Black Sage (1211 W. Myrtle St. #110, Boise, ID 83702) to acquire a UAS Radar with bracket arms.<br />UAS Radar 750m  1 each<br />Sale Default $ 1 each<br />IDB Bracket Arms 45  4 each<br />Sale Default 2 each<br />This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures with a total estimated value of $35,605. The Government's minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and requirements personnel. This memo does not authorize acquisition for other requirements. This purchase will be funded with FY19 Navy Working Capital Funds. Identification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.<br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B). Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).<br />The AFLOAT CUAS project has a need for a small form factor radar that is capable of detecting C-UAS targets up to 650m; example target DJI Phantom. The radar needs to have a minimum of 110-degrees horizontal field of view (HFOV) and 80-degrees vertical field of view (VFOV). The unit must have a minimum of IP68 rating for continuous outdoor use. The radar shall be interoperable with the Black Sage Defense OS system. The procurement shall also include (2) gigabit cables utilizing a mil-spec 11-pin connector for<br />interfacing with the Black Sage UASX system and (4) MESA-SSR hardware mounting brackets<br />compatible with the Black Sage UASX system.<br />Black Sage is the only company that can verify radar interoperability with their system, provide the<br />custom gigabit cable and hardware mounting brackets for integration with their system.<br />Market Research was conducted by the hardware integration engineer. In the search for a radar the<br />MESA SSR is the only product that fits the detection requirements. Additionally, the SSR is required<br />to integrate with the Black Sage Defense OS system which the government already owns.<br />As such, the Government does not expect significant savings through competition and does expects<br />significant and unacceptable delays that will negatively impact this requirement. Therefore, it is in<br />the Government's' best interest to award on a sole source basis to Black Sage. A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order<br />represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.106-1(b).<br />The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the<br />lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to<br />meet the Government's needs. A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the<br />results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.<br />For the reasons specified in paragraph 4 above, Black Sage is the only source that can meet the<br />Government's needs. This requirement will be synopsized in the government point of entry<br />fbo.gov.  Any other facts supporting the justification.<br />None. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any<br />barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the<br />supplies or services is made.<br />As stated in paragraph 4 above, Black Sage is the only source that can meet this requirement.<br />Section C - Specifications
<p>Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility.</p>
<p>Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.</p>
<p>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.</p>
<p>For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012</p>
<p>Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)</p>
<p>DoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.</p>
<p>Information Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.<br /> <br />Information Safeguards<br /> <br />Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:</p>
<p>a.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal) <br />b.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)</p>
<p>c.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)</p>
<p>It is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:<br /> <br /> a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)</p>
<p>b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.</p>
<p>c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.</p>
<p>d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.</p>
<p>e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.<br /> <br /> f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)</p>
<p>g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.<br /> <br /> h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.</p>
<p>i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)</p>
<p>j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:<br /> <br /> (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.<br /> <br /> (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.</p>
<p>(3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.</p>
<p>k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.</p>
<p>l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.</p>
<p>m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.</p>
<p>Operations Security</p>
<p>Operations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>Critical information includes information regarding:</p>
<p>- Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;<br /> - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities; <br /> - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters); <br /> - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;<br /> - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;<br /> - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords; <br /> - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and<br /> - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.</p>
<p>The contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:<br /> <br /> - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness; <br /> - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public; <br /> - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed; <br /> - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know; <br /> - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;<br /> - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.<br />&emsp;<br />Section F - Deliveries or performance</p>

An award will be made to the lowest priced responsible quoter submitting a technically acceptable quote. To be considered technically acceptable, the quoters must quote on all required time slots and provide the required number of buses listed in the attachments of this solicitation.
 The Contracting Officer will rank quotes from lowest to highest price, and review the technical quotes of the three lowest priced quotes first.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SECTION 2 - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT</p>
<p>2.1 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office on Women's Health (OWH) was established in 1991 within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As the focal point for women's health within HHS, OWH coordinates the efforts of all the HHS agencies and offices involved in women's health. Its vision is to ensure that "All women and girls achieve the best possible health." Its mission is to "provide national leadership and coordination to improve the health of women and girls through policy, education and model programs."</p>
<p>OWH works to redress inequities in policy, programs, health care services, and education that historically placed the health of women at risk. OWH promotes women's health through its 4 basic functions.<br />1. Coordinating and Promoting Collaborations among HHS Agencies and Offices: OWH serves as the coordinating office for women's health initiatives across the agencies of HHS, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other agencies and offices.<br />2. Providing Information on Research, Prevention and Services to Assist Decision-Makers: OWH convenes and consults with federal departments, the scientific community, professional organizations, and consumer groups to support and advance women's health. <br />3. Identifying, Developing and Supporting Innovative Programs in Women's Health: OWH promotes the development and implementation of evidence-based initiatives in academic centers and communities to address the health needs of women across different ages, cultures, races, and ethnic groups, including delivery of care to women and education of health care practitioners about women's health.<br />4. Educating Health and Wellness Professionals and Consumers: OWH promotes comprehensive health services for women across their lifespan. OWH also supports the development and use of culturally appropriate practices in medical education and research, so all individuals and communities benefit. Through its efforts, OWH brings reliable information on hundreds of health topics to women in every region of America. It also helps consumers, associations, and organizations voice their ideas about the federal government's policies on women's health.<br />2.2 PURPOSE</p>
<p>The OWH seeks one sponsorship opportunity for one or more events designed to reach women, girls, health professionals, or media influencers for women and girls. This sponsorship will allow OWH to raise the visibility of its brand, website, and key health issues while creating lasting partnerships with different organizations.</p>
<p>Attending the events will also provide OWH with direct access to different professional audiences (health professionals, social media influencers, journalists, and other creators of health content) as well as business decision makers and ultimately consumers of health information.</p>
<p>By securing the sponsorship, OWH seeks to gain:<br />&bull; Positive promotion of the OWH brand among those who create, use, or report on health information<br />&bull; Increased brand awareness by reaching a wider demographic<br />&bull; Enhanced customer experience through interactions with influencers, reporters and consumers in a positive low stress environment. <br />&bull; Opportunities for access to program attendees, including but not limited to special break-out sessions, keynote addresses, and exhibit hall opportunities</p>
<p>Sponsoring this event will enable OWH to have key time and space to address program attendees (e.g. provide keynotes and special sessions) include content in meeting handouts, have content placement in high profile sections of the event or organization's websites and social media entities) and exhibition space.</p>
<p>The contractor shall demonstrate how it will plan, implement, integrate, and successfully provide each described service or task within the specified period of performance and according to the prescribed timeframe for deliverables.</p>
<p>2.3 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment and resources to achieve the Objectives as detailed in Specific Tasks and Deliverables below.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be directly responsible for ensuring the accuracy, timeliness and completion of all tasks under this effort. Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the following Tasks:</p>

<DESC>NOTICES TO QUOTERS: <br />(1) This acquisition is being conducted as a simplified acquisition pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5.<br />(2) In accordance with FAR 4.1102 quoters are required to be registered in SAM at the time an offer or quotation is submitted.
<p>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05019Q7NMED022. The solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).</p>
<p>(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2019-01.</p>
<p>(iv) This acquisition is "Unrestricted." The associated NAICS code is 713990 with a small business size standard of $7.5M.</p>
<p>(v) List of line item numbers and items, quantities, and units of measure:<br />00001 Base Period Firing Range Services (Feb 2, 2019 - Feb 1, 2020) 144 Days<br />10001 Option Year 1 Firing Range Services (Feb 2, 2020 - Jan 22, 2021) 144 Days</p>
<p>(vi) Description of requirements for the items to be acquired: Use/rental of an existing/established firing range. See Statement of Work for specific requirements for an acceptable firing range.</p>
<p>(vii) Delivery, acceptance, and FOB point are at the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial applies to this acquisition. There are no addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items does not apply to the solicitation. The evaluation procedures to be used are as follows:<br />Award will be made using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary or in the government's best interests. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; Quotes that are not received timely<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />&bull; Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation/provisions <br />&bull; Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue in order by price until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - The quoted range meets all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p>Unacceptable - The quoted range does not meet all technical criterion stated in the Statement of Work.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2. Past Performance</p>
<p>Past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)</p>
<p>Unacceptable - Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort<br />Note: In the case of a quoter without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the quoter may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Note: Quoters are not required or requested to submit past performance references. The Government will use public and Government-restricted sources (e.g. PPIRS) to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p><br />Factor 3. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov . If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.</p>

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates.<br />Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.</p>

<p>-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).</p>

<p>-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)).

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Requirement Description:
To ensure we can continue to provide Veterans with the benefits and care they have earned through their selfless service, VA is changing the way we do business.  Specifically, we are improving the management of our supply chain to aggregate demand and facilitate ease of ordering in the field.  Throughout VA, we are moving from local contracting to national contracting whenever feasible.  Simplified ordering processes will drive volume towards suppliers with national contracts.  Simultaneously, greater cost transparency throughout the VA will allow clinicians and VA leaders to select medical equipment that optimizes Veteran outcomes at the lowest cost.
For our suppliers, we anticipate that these changes will ease the process of doing business with the VA and drive down our suppliers  costs.  We welcome opportunities to work closely with suppliers to further reduce costs.  In return, we expect that suppliers will offer the VA value commensurate with VA s status as the largest integrated healthcare provider in the United States.  Specifically, VA expects that it will receive the most favorable prices, warranties, conditions, benefits, and terms for the same product as those given by the supplier to any provider in the country.  We expect that VA s large volumes will increasingly be directed toward those suppliers best able to offer value to the VA.  VA looks forward to collaborating with its suppliers to further drive down costs in order to deliver optimal value to our Veterans.
The VA has a requirement to purchase Zeiss Brand Name or Equal Microscopes ENT to deliver patient care at its VA Medical Centers around the country. A single-award Firm-Fixed Price contract will be awarded in accordance with all terms, conditions, provisions, specifications and schedule of this solicitation herein.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The project site is approximately 60 acres and is located at 1160 N 1200 W Ogden, UT 84404. &nbsp;The building was originally constructed in 1965-1966.  It consisted of the South Building, including all areas south of the Central Atrium and the Administrative Area.  During 1968-1969, the North Building was constructed along with the Mechanical Room extensions and the enclosed south dock and warehouse spaces. The following year the Health Center was completed. The area known as &ldquo;Caf&eacute; West&rdquo; and the exterior playground area were built in 1989-1990. The main entrance at Door &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Public Access entrance at Door &ldquo;K&rdquo; were added in 1992-1993. In 1994-1995, changes were made which extended the perimeter fence, added the north dock and mechanical room, constructed the west visitor&rsquo;s security building and installed security access shelters at the drive entrances. The latest renovation in 2000 involved upgrading the Child Care Center. The IRS Main Building and property is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The IRS Service Center is one of three mission critical facilities for the IRS and is operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The agency&rsquo;s short term plans are to consolidate another division of approximately 1,700 people into the building. The building also houses an American Federal Credit Union branch, Cafeteria Services and a GSA Child Care Center. GSA has determined that the proposed repair and alteration project is the best solution that will: &nbsp;address critical needs, reduce future maintenance, improve life safety and efficiency, and minimize repair costs. Building deficiencies within this complex, as identified in the original feasibility study, currently exceed the funding allowed for this project. Reviewing the IRS&rsquo;s work item list and helping the IRS and GSA prioritize that list will be a critical part of the design A/E&rsquo;s pre-design services.  A detailed list of the work items can be found in the feasibility study.</span></p>

The project site is approximately 60 acres and is located at 1160 N 1200 W Ogden, UT 84404. &nbsp;The building was originally constructed in 1965-1966.  It consisted of the South Building, including all areas south of the Central Atrium and the Administrative Area.  During 1968-1969, the North Building was constructed along with the Mechanical Room extensions and the enclosed south dock and warehouse spaces. The following year the Health Center was completed. The area known as &ldquo;Caf&eacute; West&rdquo; and the exterior playground area were built in 1989-1990. The main entrance at Door &ldquo;A&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Public Access entrance at Door &ldquo;K&rdquo; were added in 1992-1993. In 1994-1995, changes were made which extended the perimeter fence, added the north dock and mechanical room, constructed the west visitor&rsquo;s security building and installed security access shelters at the drive entrances. The latest renovation in 2000 involved upgrading the Child Care Center. The IRS Main Building and property is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. </span></p>
<p style="line-height: 1.3800000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The IRS Service Center is one of three mission critical facilities for the IRS and is operational twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. The agency&rsquo;s short term plans are to consolidate another division of approximately 1,700 people into the building. The building also houses an American Federal Credit Union branch, Cafeteria Services and a GSA Child Care Center. GSA has determined that the proposed repair and alteration project is the best solution that will: &nbsp;address critical needs, reduce future maintenance, improve life safety and efficiency, and minimize repair costs. Building deficiencies within this complex, as identified in the original feasibility study, currently exceed the funding allowed for this project. Reviewing the IRS&rsquo;s work item list and helping the IRS and GSA prioritize that list will be a critical part of the design A/E&rsquo;s pre-design services.  A detailed list of the work items can be found in the feasibility study.</span></p>

<DESC>*****The closing date is extended to April 1, 2019. The FAA will establish a new closing date when the shutdown concludes. No other changes were done to this market survey. *****


THIS POSTING IS BEST VIEWED AT, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV. If you are viewing this announcement through Fed Biz Ops (www.fbo.gov), or any other 3rd party provider, attachments may not be available or viewable to you.

THE FAA IS LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE TECHNICAL STRATEGIES TO IMPLEMENT THE MODERNIZATION EFFORT FOR THE CIVIL AVIATION REGISTRY.  WE ARE REQUESTING RESPONSES NOT ONLY FROM COMPANIES THAT REGULARLY DO BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO FROM ANY OTHER COMPANIES THAT SEE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MODERNIZATION WITH THE CIVIL AVIATION REGISTRY PROGRAM.

PURPOSE: This market survey Request for Information (RFI) from industry is intended to refine the FAAâs operational, financial and technical strategy leading to procurement approaches in meeting the outlined Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) objectives. 

OBJECTIVE:  The FAA established the Civil Aviation Registry Electronic Services (CARES) to meet its congressional mandates and enhance the services provided by the Registry. The agencyâs objectives for this initiative will be achieved by end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021.  This market survey should identify qualified and capable sources that can provide a sound solution to the modernization effort described in the documents attached to this market survey.  The responses from this market survey may shape the strategy the Government will take for the procurement of CARES.

At this time, the acquisition strategy and nature of competition has not been determined for any potential contract. The Government welcomes statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses, which can provide the required items and services. Depending on responses to this survey and analysis of market research collected, the Government may, at its discretion, decide to pursue a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement.  Additionally, there may be one or multiple awards to accomplish this effort. 

Interested vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management, www.sam.gov.  This process can take a few months so vendors who respond to this market survey are advised to start the process.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR OFFERS. A Screening Information Request (SIR)/Request for Proposal (RFP) may be made under a separate announcement in the future. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing vendor responses to this market survey. Therefore, any cost associated with a market survey submission is solely at the interested vendorâs expense.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million.

The purpose of this announcement is to conduct a market survey to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors, in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.1.2.1. This market survey will enable the FAA to review responses that are current and will assist with acquisition planning based on current data. The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. The Government may also decide to convene an Industry Day and/or conduct targeted conversations with respondents to garner additional information pursuant to the RFI responses submitted.

HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS MARKET SURVEY: Interested vendors should submit the items listed in the CARES RFI - QUESTIONS attachment to this Market Survey.  Your submission should be formulated based upon the information provided in the CARES OVERVIEW attachment.

Responses to this market survey must be received by 5:00 P.M. CST, January 31, 2019. Please include âCARES MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE: (Insert Company Name)â in the subject line of your e-mail. Information provided will not be released but please mark PROPRIETARY on all documents submitted as necessary.

Electronic submissions should be in either Microsoft Word or Portable Document Format (PDF), as applicable. Also, please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10 MB, hence, if necessary, responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail to be received.  Electronic submission files should utilize the following naming convention: 

CARES_MS-Response_(insert your company name).pdf (or doc)

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE. ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE IN WRITING VIA E-MAIL TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER. CONTACT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BELOW.

Submissions should be sent via e-mail to the following point of contact: Stacey.Stanley@faa.gov, (405) 954-4417

The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify sources capable of performing the services described herein. This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the Government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate interested parties for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response.</p>

<DESC>A. The following are prospective offeror questions and the Government responses to these questions:
<p>Q1 - Will the title services firm have to be able to perform services in both judicial and non-judicial states? <br />A1 - While there are states that are considered Judicial or Non-Judicial, counties actually have authority to determine how they handle court actions of mortgage (Judicial) vs simple filings of Deed of Trust (Non-Judicial). Our research requirement will entail full research of all records, regardless of method, and should also include documentation, such as Commissioner's court minutes in determining status of roads (e.g., Public vs Private). The Government is looking for a definitive body of title work that will support court action of Federal condemnation, should that be necessary.</p>
<p>Q2 - Are there any preferred certifications or affiliations that the title services firm should hold? <br />A2 - The Government would prefer companies owned by, or employing, Registered Professional Landman (RPL) or Certified Professional Landman (CPL).</p>
<p>Q3 - Will title service firms with employed and active attorneys be preferred in the selection process? <br />A3 - Preference is for active attorneys as they are a must-have in the process.</p>
<p>B. Speed, responsiveness and accuracy are absolute requirements of the winning contractor. These 3 skillsets/characteristics will be evaluated during the selection process under the Technical Experience evaluation factor. These 3 skillsets/characteristics will also be evaluated periodically after the contract is awarded to determine a Past Performance rating for the contractor.</p>
