<p><br />The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates issuance of solicitation 15B31418B00000001 for the award of a firm-fixed-price construction contract for a project entitled Repair Food Service Electric at the Federal Correctional Institution located at 501 Capital Circle NE, Tallahassee, Florida 32301. The anticipated performance period for the project will be <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">208 calendar days</span></strong> from issuance of the notice to proceed. The work to be performed in association with this project includes the following scope:</p>
<p>The Food Service Building is an original construction that came on line in 1938. It currently has a 4160v switch gear in the Inside Powerhouse that feeds a 4160v transformer mounted on a pad outside of the Food Service Building. The bus duct from the transformer connects to a 1200 Amp breaker inside of the Food Service Basement. The bus duct had a catastrophic failure that resulted in a hole being blown out of the side of the bus duct. This resulted in the Food Service Building being without power. The 4160v transformer is currently being utilized by bypassing the bus duct with 500 MCM cable to provide power to the building. The switch gear, bus duct, transformer, and breakers are all obsolete. The intent of this project is to leave the buildings power fully operational and to tie into the 12470v High Voltage Switch by the Unicor Warehouse that has already been designated for the Food Service Building. The contractor shall install underground lines approximately 126.50 ft from vault EMH#1E to the new transformer location. The contractor shall run a new duct from a new 12470-120/208v pad mounted transformer. The new bus duct will run through the wall to the basement to feed a new 2000 amp main distribution panel replacing panel TAL-57-MDP. All other existing panels in the room and the panel located upstairs in the Recreation Center will be fed from the new MDP.&nbsp; Also, due to moisture in the location panels Tal-55-pan, Tal-56-pan, and Tal-57-pan in the basement will need to be replaced with Nema 3R enclosure(s).&nbsp; As part of the project. the contractor shall install one (1) new 2000 Amp breaker, one (1) new 1000 KVA transformer for our 12470 high voltage loop, replace and wire our main distribution panel, as well as three (3) other panels in the same room.&nbsp; The secondary side of the high voltage transformer would be 120/208V. Work includes, but is not limited to: design of the new fully-functional electrical system, breaker upgrades, replacement of the transformer, and new conduit and wiring.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 36.204, the estimated magnitude of the project lies between $500,000 and $1,000,000. (<em>NOTE: This range is one of 8 available ranges from FAR 36.204 and is not meant to imply that the project has necessarily been estimated/budgeted to the maximum of the selected range.

<CONTACT>Sarah Turner, Email KWP9@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to VitroCell Systems GmbH for the purchase of a Vitrocell Cloud 12 exposure system. The Vitrocell Cloud 12 will assist the laboratory in performing a comprehensive assessment of adverse respiratory effects of asbestos/asbestiform fibers/cleavage fragments, and to identify the critical factors/mediators and mechanisms of fiber induced toxicity and pathogenesis. Simulating human-relevant exposure is critical for assessing the toxicological potential of nanomaterials in in vitro systems as alternatives to animal testing. By using the Vitrocell Cloud exposure system, the laboratory will be able to apply an in vitro testing strategy to assess pulmonary toxicity following exposure to aerosolized particles. This direct continuous exposure at the air-liquid interface is more representative of human-relevant exposures than intermittent exposure or submerged systems, and it can be used to assess the potential hazards associated with aerosolized materials in a scalable, flexible, dosimetrically-relevant format. The Vitrocell Cloud system has been engineered to enable direct exposure of mammalian cells or tissue at the air&shy;liquid interface where the cell systems are not covered with culture medium. This approach allows for more credible and authentic results than by submerged exposure due to a closer replication of the human physiology. The unique features of the Vitrocell Cloud 12, including separate clean air exposure (three replicates) in one module with the test material, uniform and high deposition efficiency, no losses of nanomaterials used, no reaction of principle components with culture medium, and high sensitivity of system, make it the only exposure system that meets the laboratory's requirements. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS; however, all responses received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be reviewed by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any response should be emailed to contract specialist at kwp9@cdc.gov by 31 May 2018.</p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Air Force District of Washington Contracting Directorate (AFDW/PK), 1500 W. Perimeter Rd., Suite 2750, Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762, intends to procure this requirement for the United States Headquarters Air Force (HAF), Deputy Chief of Staff for Studies, Analyses and Assessments (HQ USAF/A9) Modeling Study Support.</p>
<p>This is a synopsis for a non-commercial acquisition pursuant to FAR Part 15. HQ USAF/A9 has a requirement for modeling and simulations to support force structure decisions, analyze potential force employment options and evaluate the contribution of various weapons and weapon systems to the outcome of key objectives in campaign-level conflicts. The Synthetic Theater Operations Research Model (STORM) is the model of choice here from Campaign level analyses. For analyses at this level of war, AF/A9 utilizes various tools to assess the air, space and cyberspace campaign's impact on the overall joint campaign. These analyses demand accurate and timely representation of the many dimensions of air, space and cyberspace warfare and their relationship to actions by other services or coalition forces. To examine the military potential of proposed doctrinal changes or evolving weapon systems, AF/A9 uses flexible, state-of-the-art theater-level models. STORM is the Air Force's campaign model solution, integrating air, space, sea, land and cyberspace domains. STORM is a dynamic, complex analytic simulation representing campaign-scale military operations in a joint war fighting context. The anticipated Period of Performance (PoP) is five (5) years starting 28 November 2018.</p>
<p>The Government intends to make a single award to the offeror that represents the best overall value considering technical acceptability, price, and past performance. This effort will be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The place of contract performance will be at a contractor facility that is local to the National Capital Region (NCR) to ensure appropriate AF/A9 coordination. The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code&nbsp;is 541330, Engineering Services. The solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 1 July 2018 at <span style="COLOR: blue">www.fbo.gov</span>. No hard copies of the solicitation will be issued for any reason. The proposed solicitation number is FA7014-18-R-1011. The anticipated time allotted for response to the solicitation is thirty (30) days. The anticipated award date is on or before 26 November 2018. Point of Contact (POC) is Lt. William Engelhart, Contract Specialist, (240) 612-6182 or william.m.engelhart.mil@mail.mil.</p>

<p>Description</p>
<p>The construction acquisition is to Sustain/Repair the Air Handling Units (AHUs), East Fairchild Hall (Bldg. 2354) at the United States Air Force Academy, CO.</p>
<p>Most of the AHU systems in Bldg 2354, Fairchild Hall are original to the building and in operation since approximately 1960.

The HVAC consists mainly of air handling units and reheat coils serving spaces. Reheat coils were retrofitted with VAV boxes in the early 90s. The building is served by the Central Heat Plant which provides high temp hot water of up to 400 degrees. The chilled water is generated at the Fairchild Hall chiller plant, with cooling towers located at the Aero Lab. This project will upgrade AHU equipment in mechanical rooms: 1-B43, 1-E9 and 1-H15, consisting mainly of 17 existing air handling units and associated equipment. Replacement air handling units number only 15, since 2 existing will not be replaced. Most piping and ductwork insulation is original and may contain asbestos. Work includes HVAC demo, HVAC ductwork, HVAC piping, electrical wiring, ACM abatement, and HVAC balancing.</p>

Magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The proposed contract would be awarded to one vendor as a firm-fixed price construction contract. Current estimated completion time is 400 calendar days.</p>
<p>All future notices will be posted under the current solicitation number (FA7000-18-R-0017). A solicitation is not available at this time; therefore do not request a copy of the solicitation.

<DESC>The DLA Troop Support intends to solicit for a full-line of produce support for DoD (Troop) customers and Non-DoD (USDA School) customers located in the Kentucky and Indiana Zone. This acquisition will be issued on an unrestricted basis for the Troop (Group 1) portion, unrestricted on the School (Group 2) portion and unrestricted on the Indiana Troop and School (Group 3) portion. The total length of the contract will be three (3) years. It contains two (2) eighteen (18) month tiers.<br />Its estimated maximum total contract dollar value is $48,000,000.00. The delivery points require indefinite quantities of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables throughout the term of the contract. A more detailed listing of the delivery sites can be found in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by DLA Troop Support.
<p>The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The source selection method for this procurement will be the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures and shall use the following to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Acceptability - A technically acceptable offer is an offer that takes no exceptions to the terms and conditions in the solicitation and complies fully with all submission requirements, including submissions relating to the two subfactors listed below. A proposal that takes exception to solicitation terms and conditions or that fails to comply with all submission requirements may be deemed technically unacceptable and, thus, may be found ineligible, and removed from further consideration, for the award. By submitting a proposal with no exceptions, an offeror is confirming it possesses the necessary facilities, equipment, technical skills and capacity to successfully provide all items required by this solicitation. The following sub-factors will be evaluated and must be found acceptable for a proposal to be eligible for award:</p>
<p>A. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) License - The offeror shall possess and submit proof of a valid current PACA license. The submitted PACA license must be effective for at least thirty (30) days after the solicitation closing date.</p>
<p>B. Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) Audit - The offeror shall submit a valid,current USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate covering a full range of fresh fruits and vegetables for each place of performance identified in the offeror's proposal. The audit report must demonstrate a passing score, and specifically passing in the following parts: General, Wholesale Distribution (6) and Preventive Food Defense (7). In lieu of a USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate, the offeror may submit an audit report / certificate conducted by a recognized private independent third-party certifying company certifying to an industry recognized food safety standard that exceeds all aspects of the USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate requirements. The audit report(s) must demonstrate that a passing score(s) was/were received. NOTE: Offerors relying on a non-USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate must agree to have a USDA GAP/GHP audit report / certificate for each place of performance by the start of contract performance.</p>
<p>2. Pricing - Pricing is required for all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable) and for all tiers. Failure to offer pricing for all items and for all tiers may result in a proposal being removed from consideration for award as technically unacceptable. The Government will perform an aggregate price analysis on all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable). To determine an offeror's Evaluated Aggregate Price, the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price will be added to the Aggregate Delivered Price. Please refer to paragraph (d) of this provision for further details regarding these price components. The award(s) will be made on the basis of the lowest Evaluated Aggregate Price (for each Group, if applicable) of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors. The Government reserves the right to remove item(s) from the Schedule of Items or do a common item comparison if offerors do not submit pricing for all items. Prior to award, the offered prices of the presumptive awardee(s) will be evaluated on an individual line-item basis to determine whether each price is fair and reasonable using analytical techniques deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer in her/his complete discretion.<br />Past Performance will not be used as an evaluation factor for this solicitation since technical problems are not anticipated. In accordance with FAR 15.304(c)(3)(iii), the Contracting Officer has determined that Past Performance is not appropriate due to the fact that all producers of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables are considered to be technically equal based on historical records of equal technical ratings for past performance. All known vendors have similar records of good delivery of quality items. Past Performance will be considered in a determination of responsibility for the successful offeror prior to award. <br />The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />See www.ams.usda.gov/services/auditing/gap-ghp/audit for details concerning program and certification.<br />Copies of the solicitation will be found on the DLA-EBS Internet Bid Board System at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil. If not already registered, prospective offerors will be required to do so prior to viewing and downloading a copy of the solicitation. RFPs are in portable document format (PDF). In order to download and view these documents, prospective offerors will need the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader. This software is available free at http://adobe.com. Anticipated solicitation issue date will be May 23, 2018. This solicitation will be issued under FAR 15.101-2 Low Price Technically Acceptable (LTPA).</p>
<p>The resultant award will be for an indefinite delivery contract, with a guaranteed minimum of 10% of the estimated contract value.</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The solicitation will be posted on or about May 30, 2018</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This solicitation and any resultant contract is a stewardship project in accordance with Section 323 of Public Law 108-7 (16 U.S.C. 2104 Note, as revised February 28, 2003 to reflect sec. 323 of J.J. Res. 2 as enrolled), the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, amending Public Law 105-277, sec. 347.  This is a commercial item acquisition that has been tailored to fit the Government's method of trading goods for services.  Work includes 14 mandatory activity bid items that will be treated in addition to conifer removal and commercial sawlog removal on 51.8 acres.&nbsp; Treatment areas consist of natural stands bordering meadow and riparian zones.</p>
<p>The intent of the Baldwin CTL contract is to conduct commercial and pre-commercial tree removal to improve meadow habitat and reduce potential seed sources, reduce stand densities for overall forest health, and create desired structure for the defense zone in the Wildland Urban Interface in order to sufficiently affect a reduction in potential fire behavior and promote the health and resiliency of the forest and community around South Lake Tahoe, CA.</p>
<p>Treatments will be accomplished through cutting and removal of small and mid-sized trees using a designation by species and diameter. A combination of sawlog and biomass removal, and lopping &amp; scattering will occur within treatment units.  Landing slash removal will be the responsibility of the Contractor and is a mandatory bid item.  Completion of associated erosion control and road maintenance work will be required for all operations and is a mandatory bid item.  Brush treatment is not a bid item and is not a requirement of this contract.</p>
<p>It is the intent of this contract to both remove and dispose of as much activity and existing slash and other biomass generated from operations as feasible so as to limit the amount of post-contract slash remaining on site. Whole tree removal of small trees, non-merchantable bole material, and removal of top portions and limbs of larger trees to the landing will be required. Removal of existing standing dead trees to the landing will be required.</p>

GENERAL INFORMATION:  

VISN 9 has approximately forty (40) Architect and Engineering (A-E) design requirements for professional A-E services that require the design of various Non-Recurring Maintenance (NRM), Clinical Specific Initiatives (CSI), Minor Construction, and station level projects. Design services to be provided are multi-discipline in nature and primarily focused on Architectural, Structural, Civil, Landscaping (hereinafter referred to as  General Designs ), Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Designs, and Small-Scale Renovation Projects. A-E services may consist of any combination of services. NCO 9 anticipate awarding multiple A-E Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ s) for VISN 9.  A minimum of two (2) A-E IDIQs will be established for each medical center listed below for a total of eight (8) A-E IDIQs, for VISN 9.  For the purposes of this requirement, the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System is considered one medical center and the Lexington VA Medical Center is considered one medical center as well. The following medical centers encompass VISN 9:

Tennessee Valley Health Care System
Nashville VA Medical Center   1310 24th Avenue South, Nashville, TN 37212
Alvin C. York VA Medical Center - 3400 Lebanon Pike, Murfreesboro, TN 37129

Lexington VA Medical Center
Lexington VA Medical Center   Cooper Division (Lexington, KY)
Lexington VA Medical Center   Leestown Division (Lexington, KY)

Memphis VA Medical Center (Memphis, TN)

James H. Quillen VA Healthcare System (Mt. Home, TN)

Each VISN 9 medical center will have two (2) A-E IDIQs established with two (2) different disciplines:

General Design (General)
Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Design

Thus, there will be up to 8 A-E IDIQs awarded VISN wide: one General IDIQ for each of the four medical centers and one MEP IDIQ for each of the four medical centers.

Each A-E IDIQ will have a base period of one (1) year and four (4) one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government, or until the maximum contract amount of $32,000,000.00 awarded across all A-E IDIQ contracts is reached, whichever is earlier.  
Firm-fixed price task orders will be negotiated for this contract. Estimated award date is October 31, 2018.

The task order limitation will be a minimum of $2,500.00 and maximum of $500,000.00, subject to the conditions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.216-19 - Order Limitations. The minimum guarantee for each A-E IDIQ award will be $2,500.00 and will be awarded at the time of A-E IDIQ award. Design services to be provided are multi-disciplined in nature and primarily focused on Architectural, Structural, Civil, Landscaping (hereinafter referred to as  General Design ) and/or Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Designs. The A-E services may consist of any combination of services stated herein. 

RESPONSE TIME

A-Es shall abide by a four (4) hour response time for all of the medical centers for all A-E requirements during the design phase and the construction period services (CPS) phase, as appropriate. This response time applies to each task order requirement awarded for each VISN 9 task order requirement. The VA has no preference on the method utilized by contractors on achieving the four (4) hour response time. The response time will be determined from the moment the request to the A-E to be on site is submitted.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 

A-E firms will provide specialized and innovative design-related A-E services in support of the Veterans Affairs Mid-South Network s Capital Design and Construction Program specifically pertaining to VISN 9. Disciplines and expertise required shall include healthcare design, historic preservation, fire/life safety, architectural, civil engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, fire protection engineering, roofing design, construction inspection, scheduling, AutoCAD/Building Information Modeling (BIM) design, acoustical engineering, lighting engineering, interior design, surveying, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, certified industrial hygiene, design of contemporary, state-of-the-art medical facilities, with additional experience in vertical expansion/integration along with phasing of on-going operations, research facilities, long-term care, mental health and dementia, elevators, and other disciplines and experts with specialized experience.

Most construction projects, not design, under each A-E IDIQ will have an estimated construction cost range from $25,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.

Contractor employees shall not be considered government employees for any purpose under the foreseeable contract.

Changes to this requirement will only be accomplished by a written modification which is formally executed by the contractor and the Contracting Officer.  

INTENT: 

For each A-E IDIQ, the Government expects the most highly qualified firms to be able to perform multiple designs simultaneously, as appropriate. The Government does not expect A-E IDIQ awardees to be able to perform every type of A-E service described in this synopsis. Instead, the government seeks to contract with A-E firms that are experienced and knowledgeable conducting a variety of A-E services in multiple disciplines but specific to General and/or MEP designs. Therefore, SDVOSBs of all types that perform A-E services described in this synopsis are encouraged to submit Standard Form 330s (SF-330).

For purposes of this synopsis, the term "Offeror" refers to the firm or Joint-Venture firm(s) that submits an SF-330 because of this synopsis.

SELECTION PROCEDURES: 

(a) Selections of the most highly-qualified firms shall be made in accordance with procedures provided in the Brooks Act, Public Law 92-582, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36, and VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 836.6.

(b) Respondents SF330 Qualifications packages received shall be evaluated in accordance within strict compliance with the requirements and selection criteria specifically set forth in the FBO synopsis. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the offeror, customer inquiries, government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers may result in a firm being considered less qualified.
(c) Each firm must demonstrate their (including subcontractors ) qualifications with respect to the selection criteria listed below. SF330s will be evaluated via a numerical rating system to determine the most highly qualified firm/team based on submitted SF330 responses.  Failure to provide requested data or comply with the instructions in the synopsis and SF330 instructions could result in a firm being considered less qualified or eliminated from consideration. 
(d) The Respondent's SF330 submission must adequately address each Evaluation Selection Criterion. All responsive submissions for Phase 1 selections of most highly rated firms will be evaluated using the following Evaluation Selection Criteria, listed in descending order of significance:  
PHASE 1 Evaluation Selection Criteria

<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a contract/purchase order for "Robotic Consumable Plates" to function/fit with NCATS HTS Equipment, with:<br /><br />Aurora Microplates, Inc.<br />A Division of Edison Eight, LLC<br />806 Second St. East<br />Whitefish, MT 59937</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br />Project Description, Background and Purpose<br />Well plates are required to be used on multiple robotic screening systems currently in use in our National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS) in addition to traditional wet lab research for assay optimization and validation. Over the past 10 years, NCATS has made a substantial investment in HTS systems, spending over $20M in automated equipment to run these experiments. The two most active systems at the center are the Kalypsys Primary Screening system and the Tox21 Robotic Screening system.</p>
<p>The Aurora brand of plates is currently being used because they are compatable with NCATS HTS systems. The use of plates compatible and optimized for use with the NCATS systems are of critical importance. There are two primary factors that determine compatibility: the flange style of the plate and the support ribs underneath the plate that run along the base of the plate and connect to the outer wall. The flange of Aurora plates are low; the design of our robotic grippers on our screening platform is such that when it grips the plate it does so along the flange of the plate, creating a dovetail joint. This ensures that our robotic system has a solid grip and will never drop a plate. Secondly, several support ribs on the underside of the Aurora plates are removed so that they can be properly placed on pin support plate nests that are present on several of the peripheral devices on our screening systems. Without the removal of these support ribs the plates will not rest properly and the peripheral devices will not perform correctly. All plates must be GNF/Wako (formerly Kalypsys) certified.</p>
