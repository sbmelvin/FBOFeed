<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer more questions.  They are as follows:

Question:  What is the intended application for the badging system (i.e. photo ID card only, photo ID card with access control, photo id/fingerprint embedded for access control, permits, etc.)?  Answer:  Photo ID card with fingerprint embedded.  The finger print is for security purposes.

Question: Does a standard layout for the badge exist?  If no, how many badge layout templates should be included as part of the training/labor?  If yes, would a copy of the badge layout be provided?  Answer:  Yes on the Access Data base there is a layout containing NAME, RANK, IAF SERIAL NUMBER, PHOTO, FINGER PRINT, ISSUE DATE, AND EXPERATION DATE.  You can also add any additional information to the layout if you want.  

Question:   Will the badging stations be networked between the various facilities/badging stations (i.e. all stations sharing one database)?  Answer:  No the databases will remain separate.

Question:  If networking is required, who shall provide the infrastructure for the network (i.e. CAT5, fiber or microwave communications between the 15 or more badging stations/sites)?  Answer:  Not required.

Question:  does your current security protocol allow for remote access to the badging stations for the purpose of providing technical support, troubleshooting and training assistance to personnel rotating, etc?  Answer:  No, they do not have remote access to the station—you have to get the whole computer and work on it.

Question:  Is Microsoft Access the only option for the database?  Are systems that utilize MSSQL and provides a more reliable, robust, ad secure database system satisfactory:  Answer:  The access program is the way that the CPA makes their ID cards—a MSSQL is too complicated to use and too expensive.

Question:  What is the purpose of the fingerprint reader (i.e. biometric access thru doors, to print the fingerprint on the ID card, to output the fingerprint to other sites/stations, to act as alternative to password control to the badging station, etc.)?  Answer:  The purpose of the fingerprint reader is to print the fingerprint on the ID card.
