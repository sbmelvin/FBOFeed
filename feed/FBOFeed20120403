It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in sub contracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

<DESC>The AATD Contracting Division, Army Contracting Command, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 13.501 with Performance Indicator, LLC.  The proposed contract action will be a new firm fixed price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The proposed contract action will purchase the engineering services in support of the 6.2 Close Combat Survivability (CCS) initiatives, more specifically in the area of paints.  Additional spectral performance is desired to reduce the susceptibility of Army assets with regards to their signatures.  The proposed contract is for the development of paints which have photoluminescent properties in the near infrared while at the same time maintain their visual color characteristic, including gloss levels.  This is proposed to be carried out as an effort to baseline the possibilities and to further develop a technology which would provide increased near infrared performance while maintaining the visual color.  Such a technology could be incorporated into future paints allowing for an increase in the capability in the paints ability to aid in the area of susceptibility reduction Army assets and at the least provides support and understanding for incorporation of this unique and valuable capability into future paint studies.<br><br>Performance Indicator, LLC currently is the only source that possesses the unique and original technology that allows phosphors to store light energy when excited by light of appropriate wavelength, and re-emit this stored light energy over time in the infrared. The long persistent phosphors typically are charged with long Ultra Violet / short visible radiation and can emit light (photoluminescent) in the near infrared for over 10 hours after the excitation source is removed. Their technology is self activating with natural light and hence will not required to be excited with an external energy source such as a laser during detection of the near infrared emission, and is a unique characteristic developed by Performance Indicator, LLC on to itself.    Additionally, as a result of prior, self-funded work Performance Indicator, LLC has demonstrated their ability to produce paints that meet the required capabilities to maintain visual color characteristics, including level of gloss, while selectively modulating infrared self emission properties. Performance Indicator, LLC technology provides for an extremely broad dynamic range of controllable infrared emissions while maintaining desirable visual characteristics unavailable from other sources. As a result of Performance Indicator, LLC's previous efforts, possession Intellectual property and Trade Secret knowledge it would be expensive and significantly time consuming for the USG to replicate through new development efforts.   There is no source other than Performance Indicator, LLC to provide the level of system-specific expertise and background needed to successfully develop and demonstrate in the manner specified.  <br> <br><br><br>No request for quotes/proposals will be posted.  Interested sources may identify interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will review and consider all capabilities statements or proposals received within the closing date set in this notice.

<DESC>PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) has a requirement for a Universal Mine Model Specification Development and Resource Assessment.
<p>The CDC intends to award a single Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13. The period of performance will be 12 months after the start of the contract.</p>
<p><br />Background</p>
<p>The NIOSH Office of Mine Safety &amp; Health Research (OMSHR) intends to develop a universal map-based mine model and associated data structure for R&amp;D, computer simulation, and visualization of mine related systems. This Universal Research, Simulation, and Analysis Mine Model (URSAMM) will include a standardized Graphical User Interface (GUI) for inputs to simulation models and display of mine related events and processes. The project will also provide a tool for editing and translating mine information for use in various mine simulations.</p>
<p>The URSAMM project as currently envisioned would use ArcGIS, which is a CDC supported GIS tool already used within many parts of CDC for the display, manipulation, and analysis of data. NIOSH believes that this GIS provides a straightforward path for the display and manipulation of the outputs from various NIOSH developed mine models. Some of the models and capabilities considered for incorporation into the tool include:</p>
<p>&bull; Modeling radio frequency (RF) coverage levels (redundancy - over lap)<br />&bull; Tracking system performance estimation<br />&bull; Modeling Sensor Location Strategies for Atmospheric Monitoring Systems <br />&bull; Noise level predictive studies<br />&bull; Mine inundation studies<br />&bull; Survivability analysis<br />&bull; Explosion potential and fire propagation predictions<br />&bull; Ground control stress distribution analysis<br />&bull; Infrastructure design improvements</p>
<p>NIOSH anticipates that the first application developed under this approach is a radio coverage model for underground coal mine communications systems.</p>
<p>While the use of ArcGIS is the best path forward from the perspective of development within OMSHR, the objective of this work is to make NIOSH models and simulation tools available as widely as possible to aid engineers in improving mine safety and health through design. To meet this goal, the models and simulation tools must be available in formats and modules that serve as many end users as possible. These end users will include OMSHR researchers, MSHA and state regulatory specialist, mining company engineers, academic researchers, mining software companies, and mining consultants. To meet this goal, it is necessary to understand the needs and operating environments of the end users.</p>
<p>The goal of this solicitation is to prepare a project overview and development specification document that describes in detail the challenges in meeting the targeted end user needs and that recommends a specific design approach. The specification document will include a discussion of potential problems with an ArcGIS based solution, specific recommendations for data structure, data export and import, and interfaces to other applications, and identify possible partners for the NIOSH development effort.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the experience of the assigned Principle Investigator and associated support personnel including subcontractors and partners on the project as follows:</p>
<p>Experience in simulation and model development for discrete events. The preferred experience would involve large databases and multiple models to arrive at determination of values over a large geographical area. Experience with modeling of radio coverage of wireless systems is desirable.</p>
<p>ArcGIS experience. The preferred experience is in the area of integrating third party applications into ArcGIS and 3D representation and manipulation of data. Experience with scanning and geo-referencing raster images within ArcGIS is desirable.</p>
<p>Underground mine design experience. The preferred experience is in the area of mine ventilation systems and mine communications systems design.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document, and reference material with specific tasks, will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about April 18, 2012 and quotes will be due on or about May 4, 2012. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted. It is the responsibility of perspective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps internet site.</p>
<p>No government-wide notes apply. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov</p>
<p>All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<DESC><em>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Alaska Pacific Regional Office (APRO) hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to Walter Parker, Parker and Associates, Anchorage, AK to "Coordinate and Collaborate Efforts for a Major Research and Prevention Project: Preventing Morbidity and Mortality Among Arctic Oil Spill Response Workers."</em>
<p>Background</p>
<p>This contract will assist the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Alaska Pacific Regional Office (APRO) accomplish the goal of reducing occupational injuries and fatalities among workers in two of the highest-risk industries (commercial fishing and oil and gas extraction), each of which may become involved in Arctic disasters and/or the response to them. This will be accomplished through the collaborative efforts of the Emergency Prevention, Preparedness, and Response (EPPR) Working Group of the Arctic Council and APRO in a major research and prevention project," Preventing Morbidity and Mortality among Arctic Oil Spill Response Workers." The contractor will be retained to provide the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Alaska Pacific Regional Office (APRO) with the coordination, technical assistance, and liaison activities necessary for this extensive international collaboration. The need for this contract is significant as APRO does not have the internal capacity to provide these services.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>These activities serve CDC/NIOSH Oil and Gas and Commercial Fishing strategic goals for safety, as well as the CDC/NIOSH Global Health Collaborations goals, by fostering surveillance, collaboration, and understanding of these serious or mortal, but often preventable, events.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker is uniquely qualified and is the best provider of these specific services for APRO. He is the only vendor who has the experience, knowledge, skills and ability to collaborate on current research documents and projects, and is able to assist in developing future research, manuscripts and prevention activities in this narrow technical area. <br /><br />In 1989, Governor Cowper appointed Mr. Parker as Chairman of the Alaska Oil Spill Commission (1989-90) charged with examining the causes of the wreck of the Exxon-Valdez and the failure of the spill response system. The Commission's work was a primary input to the Congress as it wrote the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and to the Alaska and other state legislatures in writing state acts dealing with oil spills. Subsequently, he became Chair of the Alaska Hazardous Substance Spill Technology Review Council (1990-95) which examined oil spills and other hazardous substance problems in Alaska. During this period he also served on the National Research Council's Marine Board Committee on Pilotage and Navigation. <br />In 1995, he was appointed by President Clinton as a Commissioner of the Arctic Research Commission (1995-2001). This led to appointment to the U.S. delegation to the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy Working Group on Emergency Preparation, Prevention and Response in 1995, where he still serves.</p>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6072, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br />Description<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Nutritional Epidemiology Branch, plans to procure on a sole source bases with Cancer Hospital/Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, No. 17, Panjiayuan Nanli, Chaoying District, Beijing China 100021 to obtain pre-diagnostic serum concentrations.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard in $14.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be from date of award for two months.</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.</p>
<p>The Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), conducts intramural research in areas related to nutrition, metabolism and cancer which are aimed at lowering human cancer risk. Focus areas of NEB research include cancers of the liver. In 2008, there were an estimated 748,300 new cases of liver cancer globally and as the prognosis after a liver cancer diagnosis is poor, nearly 695,900 deaths; ranking as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.</p>
<p>A number of exposures likely contribute to the burden of liver cancer worldwide. In particular, insulin resistance, as can be measured by serum insulin and glucose concentrations; c-reactive protein is a measure of inflammation in the blood; serum calcium, which could be associated with cancer through a number of possible mechanisms, and iron status, as measured by concentrations of iron, ferritin, and unsaturated iron binding capacity. However, further studies are needed to evaluate these hypotheses.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the baseline concentrations of pre-diagnostic serum insulin, glucose, c-reactive protein, calcium, iron, ferritin, and unsaturated iron binding capacity from a case-control study of 226 participants who developed incident liver cancer, 282 individuals who died of cirrhosis, and 1063 age- and sex- matched controls from the Linxian Nutritional Intervention Cohort. In addition, data shall provided for 43 blinded quality control samples (total samples=1614).</p>
<p>The Cancer Intitute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is an expert in cancer epidemiology. As part of the large Nutritional Epidemiology Trial, The Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and its team have measured the pre-diagnostic concentrations of serum insulin, glucose, c-reactive protein, calcium, iron, ferritin, and unsaturated iron binding capacity from a case-control study of 226 participants who developed incident liver cancer, 282 individuals who died of cirrhosis, and 1063 age- and sex- matched controls nested from the Linxian Nutritional Intervention (NIT) Cohort. The analytes were measured in samples collected at the beginning of the NIT cohort in 1985 and individuals were then followed for 22 years of follow-up by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and its team in order to identify those individuals dying of chronic liver disease and developing liver cancer. The NCI seeks the data generated from the serological testing done by the Cancer Institute. As the blood samples were collected many years before disease diagnosis by the Cancer Institute, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, these data are unique examinations of these hypotheses and are not available elsewhere.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on April 16, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax). An original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Ward, Contract Specialist, at wardmr@mail.nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-120051-MW on all correspondence.</p>

The required supplies and services are described more thoroughly in the attached draft PWS.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued to identify potential sources for this anticipated requirement.</p>
<p>This RFI is being issued for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quote (RFQ), or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor as an obligation on the part of the Requestor to acquire any products or services.</p>
<p>GSA is not committing to any final acquisition strategy as a result of this RFI and will choose the acquisition strategy that is in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>GSA does not intend to pay for the information requested. All information provided is for Government planning use only. If proprietary information is provided, please mark as Proprietary for Government Use Only (in addition to any other of your company's standard verbiage).</p>

<p>1.	GSA anticipates a &lsquo;hard shut down' of most or all of the conveyor system for a period of two weeks to do the installation of the replacement and overhaul portions of the conveyor system.  Is this two-week time frame reasonable based on the work as described in the PWS?  Would more time be needed?  Would less time be needed?  What other factors might affect the time needed?</p>
<p>2.	Based on the PWS description, how much planning/designing time do you anticipate needing before starting on the installation?  Once design/plan is final, how much staging time do you anticipate needing prior to doing a "hard shutdown" and final installation?</p>
<p>3.	Can your company provide all of the needed supplies and services to complete the deliverables?   If not, would you plan to subcontract with another company to accomplish this?</p>
<p>4.	At your option, provide a brief statement of your past experience performing similar work, not to exceed 100 words.</p>
<p>5.	Would you be willing and able to attend a site visit at the EDC in Burlington, NJ?</p>
<p>6.	Is your company able and willing to provide supplies and services for all of the deliverables outlined in the attached draft PWS?</p>
<p>7.	At your option, provide a very rough cost estimate of the project.</p>
<p><br />ii.	The NAICS code under which the needed supplies and services will be provided.</p>
<p>iii.	A brief statement of your experience (not exceeding 500 words) providing services of a similar size and scope to Government agency customer(s).</p>
<p>iv.	At your option, provide the Solicitation numbers of previous solicitations for similar work.</p>
<p>v.	At your option, provide comments on the draft PWS.  Submitted comments or suggestions will be read and considered but may or may not be incorporated.  The final version of the PWS, including its scope and technical details, is at the sole discretion of the appointed Contracting Officer for any eventual solicitation.  Comments may be made in the margins, appended to the bottom of the draft PWS, or suggested using &lsquo;Track Changes' or other software functionality.</p>
<p><br />Provide answers to items i-iv above on a single document.  If you choose to complete point v, (PWS comments/changes), you can include this in that same, single document with the rest of your answers or provide it as a separate attachment, whichever is most convenient.</p>
<p>You can provide links with further information about the supplies and services you provide but please no marketing materials.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this RFI should be addressed via e-mail to Steve Kinsella at steve.kinsella@gsa.gov or by phone at 816-823-1296.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit their responses by email to steve.kinsella@gsa.gov by the closing date of this RFI.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Region Acquisition Division-Kansas City, MO (ERAD-KC) and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with EOM Offshore, LLC for the purchase of three (3) each 50 feet Mooring Electromechanical Hose Assembly, which is an elastic mooring embedded copper conductors. EOM Offshore is the only known manufacturer that can provide an elastic mooring hose that meets the Government's requirements. This is a bungee-like cord with electrical wires coiled inside designed to moor meteorological buoys and allow information and power to be transferred from the top of the buoy to instruments down below. The reinforced rubber stretch hose was developed for mooring systems that require a stable platform for sensors or acoustics. It can stretch to two and half times its original length and services as a highly effective and robust mechanical isolator between the surface buoy and the quiet low mooring section. The hose construction makes use of elastomer-synthetic composite technology for elasticity and strength and also has eight numbers 22 electrical conductors built into it to allow signals and power to be transmitted along its length. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. However, all responses received within 7 calendar days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to EOM Offshore, LLC, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. EOM Offshore is a company spawned from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and they have developed this method of mooring buoys and coupling them to seabed instrumentation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The NAICS code for this action is 335999. All contractors doing business with the ERAD-KC must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification with the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). This is a Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs) process.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD) at China Lake is seeking information from potential sources regarding Radio Frequency (RF) Electronic Warfare Systems Integration Test Environment (SITE) system, upgrade to an existing system currently at China Lake, and maintenance for all EW SITE and EW SITE Lite Systems for the Advanced Weapons Laboratory (AWL) located at China Lake, CA and Pt Mugu, CA. The results of this sources sought will be utilized to determine if other sources exist (all set-aside categories will be considered) and determine if commercial items are suitable for off the shelf use or if commercial items could be modified to meet the agency's needs.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND

The F/A-18 Advanced Weapons Laboratory (AWL) currently utilizes an Electronic Warfare Systems Integration Test Environment (EW SITE) to support the ability to validate performance and integration of the systems and capabilities of all variants of the F/A-18.
  The EW SITE is used to test the full complement of F/A-18 subsystems using the RF spectrum.  This provides digitally controlled frequency, phase, amplitude, and time based modulation.  Adding additional test assets to the AWL serves to provide a more robust threat environment in the form of a high pulse density in a dynamic, simulated, flight environment.  Simulated tests in a lab environment versus a flight environment allows the AWL to generate more scenarios that approximate real threats the F/A-18 will face in hostile circumstances.  Having a lab test environment that emulates the pulse density and characteristics of EW Flight Test Threat Ranges allows testing of systems for extended periods of time with the benefit of visibility into system performance, that lab test instrumentation provides, which is not available on an aircraft.
 
 
The existing Government RF EW Site system was procured under contract N68936-09-C-0971 and N68936-09-C-0138. These contracts were awarded to Applied Geo Technologies, Inc. as the prime contractor and AAI Corporation as the subcontractor. These were both Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts.  Information regarding the prior contracts can be requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process. The FOIA information concerning the current contract is available at http://www.navair.navy.mil/nawcwd/counsel/textonly/foia-txt.htm.

NAWCWD intends to award a sole source follow on contract to AAI Corporation based on the authority under Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.
 
REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

The Government's EW Site System consists of three major elements to include SSI's, stimulus cabinet, and maintenance alignment cabinet. AAI Corporation is the developer and manufacturer of the SITE and is the only known source of equipment and software compatible with the existing electronic warfare test equipment.  Compatibility with the existing system is required to enable sharing of hardware components between threat simulators and leveraging of existing government-developed threat scenario software.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW) is attached to this Sources Sought to provide a detailed technical description of the Governments requirements.

ELIGIBILITY

The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 334515.
 
The Product Service Code (PSC) is 5985.

SUBMISSION DETAILS

Interested businesses shall submit a statement of capability and include:

Description of relevant contract experience (Government and Commercial).  Address your experience with Electronic Warfare Threat Simulation Systems and demonstrated capability of your companys resources to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work to include compatibility with the Government's existing EW SITE simulators without modification to either the hardware or software components.  Describe your systems ability to share hardware components between threat simulators and transportability of Threat Simulation files created on your equipment (machine to machine) to existing government owned simulator systems without modification of the threat simulation.

Any interested party that feels they can meet this requirement must identify in writing their interest, experience, and capability statement of past work no later than April 18, 2012 via email to the Contract Specialist, Terri Hand, via a Microsoft Word .doc or Acrobat Adobe .pdf file.
  File must not exceed 10 pages with a minimum font size of 12 point.  As a general rule, no information is better than bad information. Classified material shall not be submitted.  All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size, and Points-of-Contact (POC) including name, phone number, fax number, and email address. No phone or email solicitations with regards to the status of the RFP will be accepted prior to its release.

<DESC>The Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU), Panama City is conducting a survey of potential sources for the development of a hyperbaric (01000 psig) high-throughput planar-based electrophysiology screening station to elucidate electrophysiological modifications in voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels following exposure to military, commercial, and experimental diving paradigms. Using a well-based planar approach supported by commercial planar chips, the system should also be able to screen for modifications in channel and second-messenger pathways via fluorescence-based approaches. 

Key Performance Parameters are as follows:

-  A scalable multichannel planar patch-clamping system (01000 psig, with at least a 96-well, modular approach to allow for expansion) that will integrate into a hyperbaric chamber.
-  Designed to create the minimal footprint in the hyperbaric chamber, the system will have pressurized components capable of being mounted on a standard laboratory benchtop and will allow multiple measurement paradigms (i.e., voltage- and current-clamp recordings) on cell lines and native cell types.
-  External perfusion rate will be 05 mL/min; relevant perfusion will be continuous.
 Internal perfusion shall allow rapid change of solutions.
- Multiple perfusion scenarios can be tested in the same experimental protocol (i.e., that the same chip has  
  separate perfusion capability).
- System allows fluorescence-based imaging in conjunction with, or independent of, electrophysiological 
  recordings.
-  Software support to integrate recording of information, perfusion characteristics, and chamber data.
- Software system that enables test data to be integrated in the future.
- High-throughput data analysis software to analyze recordings. 

The following requirements must be met or exceeded:

-	 A pressure-tested high-throughput modular planar-based system with at least 96 (but scalable to 384) wells, a system operational over a range of 01000 psig.
 (designs with a minimum of 16 wells but with a scalability to at least 200 wells will be considered).  The system design may be one of single measurements per aperture or one based on a clustered approach. Unless specified by the vendor primary contact, the system shall be tested in a vendor-based chamber.  The system shall support multiple experimental runs in a testing day. 
-	Discuss current contractor-defined amplifier designs and their respective integration into the system. Support integration of a Government-defined amplifier design and modifications in supporting software. 
-	A system allowing at least three independent external and internal perfusion zones, and perfusion line inputs into the system shall support 1/16-inch stainless steel tubing and fittings.
 All perfusion zones will be scalable to additional plates, which will be of a commercially available design.
-	A system designed to be used in a laboratory bench scale mounting system; however, the system shall not exceed the dimensional limits (40 inches deep, 18 inches in diameter) of current NEDU chambers associated with this work. The final system design should use a minimal amount of space. 
-	A system that limits its components exposure to pressure. The system shall be capable of operating in an environment of varying oxygen-rich concentrations over a pressure range of 01000 psig, and it shall also be capable of operating in the presence of the background gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe at varying concentrations over that same pressure range.
-	A system that integrates expandable fluorescence excitation and emission characteristics with high-resolution imaging to allow second messenger pathways to be analyzed over time, both with and independent of electrophysiological recordings.
 
-	A system that allows potential hydrogen (pH), temperature (C), oxygen concentrations (parts per million), carbon dioxide concentrations (parts per billion), and flow rates for internal and external perfusion of affluent and effluent solutions to be quantified throughout experimental runs. 
-	Software support for operating the system that shall be integrated into the Government perfusion solution system and chamber control into a complete operational system.  
-	Modified operating manuals for hyperbaric operations and technical support for one year following the systems installation.
-	Test runs at pressure and a complete final installation and system check that, during final delivery, includes a functional experimental protocol from 01000 psig.
-	Construction plan based upon deliverables or project milestones.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS to determine the availability of Firms. NO PROPOSALS are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, South Atlantic Division, Mobile Regional Contracting Center, is seeking information regarding capability and availability of potential contractors, to Supply Satellite Communications System (SATSYS) two-way data and voice services. <br><br>Services to be supplied consist of but are not limited to, satellite communications system (SATSYS) network that will provide two-way data and voice communications via satellite service to and from remote units on both KU-band and C-band. The KU-band service will cover 50 United States, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands and the C-band service will cover Guam, the Marianna Islands, Philippines, Federated States of Micronesia, American Samoa and the Hawaiian Islands. Satellite capacity for the Deployable Tactical Operations System (DTOS) will be required on commercial satellites capable of providing both the C-band and KU-band service in multiple locations throughout the world. The SATSYS network is a Time Division Multiple Access based network with hub-spoke architecture. The provider's network hub must include support for the USACE's current inventory of iDirect Technologies Infinity 5350 or any acceptable alternatives that meet the security requirements must meet at a minimum the FIPS140-2 or the most current government processing standard at the time of contract award. The demarcation for the provider shall be the Ashburn Center, in Ashburn, Virginia. The primary teleport provides all uplink and downlink functions for the SATSYS.  In the event that the primary teleport becomes unavailable, the provider will provide business continuity via an alternate teleport to include connectivity back to the Ashburn Center. In the event that the primary satellite becomes unavailable, the provider will provide business continuity via an alternate satellite to include connectivity back to the Ashburn Center from the teleport via a dedicated terrestrial circuit. For each one of 18 of our units, the provider will provide two Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunks to support 12 concurrent calls to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  For one unit, there will be 6 VoIP lines dedicated to 6 SCCP (skinny) client phones.<br><br>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) will be able to monitor DTOS data and communications operations from the site designated as the interface to the USACE Wide Area Network (WAN).  The satellite portion of DTOS's operation will also be monitored at the host teleport.  If an anomaly is noted by either of these sites, the provider's operation center will be contacted. The Teleport Network Operations Center (NOC) personnel are available on a 24/7 basis either directly or by pager and will respond to any calls within 2 hours of notification. The Team can verify the failure, diagnose the potential problem, and if necessary, contact a service organization for an onsite service call. In this same regard, the provider shall also provide USACE with a secure means of monitoring the real-time utilization of all of the earth stations via secure website. This information shall remain available to USACE on a 24 hour 7 day a week basis and will log historical data back through at least one calendar year from the current date. All Government Request for Quotes (e.g. for additional bandwidth usually at the start of a disaster) must be processed within 24 hrs from receipt and any resulting modifications to the contract must be processed in a timely manner.<br><br><br>The transition from the existing provider to the new provider will be the most critical portion of the contract as a break in service could result in downtime for a unit and possible mission failure for the Corps of Engineers. The current provider shall ensure this continuity of service throughout the duration of the transition. For this reason, the new provider will be required to complete the transition of at least one unit within the first two weeks after contract award. Beyond this the provider will have a maximum of 60 days to complete transition of ALL assets to their services and have all systems 100% operable. The provider will be required to reprogram any and all necessary equipment. This may include but is not limited to existing controllers, modems, routers, etc. The government shall not provide ANY additional equipment to complete this transition. The provider shall retain the existing phone numbers that are currently being utilized on the existing equipment. <br><br> Potential contractors should be able to provide all or none.<br><br>The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 517410, satellite telecommunication carriers.  The Small Business Size Standard for this requirement is $15.0 Million. Offerors are requested to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis with the following information.  Responses should be limited to three pages.  <br><br>1. Offerors name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and e-mail address.  <br><br>2.

Include offerors in-house capability to execute the transition (in a timely manner), management (to include the time during a disaster), and meet system requirements; as well as any proposed subcontractors, comparable work performed within the past five years, brief description of the project, and dollar value of the project.  <br><br>3.  Offerors business size to include designation as HUBZone, 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Small Business , Large Business,  Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), etc. <br><br>4.  Small Businesses must show capability to perform at least 50% of the work (IAW FAR 52.219-14).<br><br>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than April 17, 2012, e-mail your response to U.S. Army Engineer District Mobile, Attn:  CESAM-CT/Mr. Carl Wade, E-mail Carl.M.Wade@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a new method for calibrating pitot-static air data systemsused in aircraft. Pitot-static systems are pressure-based instruments that measure theaircrafts airspeed. These systems must be calibrated in flight to minimize potentialerror. Current methods that include trailing cone, tower fly-by, and pacer airplane aretime- and cost-intensive, requiring extensive flight time per calibration. NASAs methodcan reduce this calibration time by up to an order of magnitude, cutting a significantfraction of the cost. In addition, NASAs calibration method enables near real-timemonitoring of error in airspeed measurements, which can be used to alert pilots whenairspeed instruments are inaccurate or failing. Because of this feature, the technologyalso has applications in the health usage and monitoring (HUMS) industry. Flight testengineers can be trained to use this method proficiently in 12 days without costlyspecialized hardware.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate thedate and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information.RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses areprovided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO forthe purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conductingpreliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for futurelicensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO willfollow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  Nofollow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

THE TECHNOLOGY: NASAs Langley Research Center has developed a technology at the forefront of a newgeneration of computer and video game environments that train valuable mental skills,beyond eye-hand coordination, for the personal improvement, not just the diversion, ofthe user.This technology is derived from previous research focused on automatic adaptation offlight deck controls based on user feedback. Monitoring and enhancement of operator stateis an objective of the current LaRC Intelligent Integrated Flight Deck Technology (IIFDT)program. Prior research by the inventor, Alan Pope, modulate (based on playerphysiological signals) the manual inputs that a player makes to the buttons or joysticksof a video game hand controller. However, a new type of controller allows a player tomake inputs to a video game by moving the entire controller itself, allowing the presentinventions entirely new approach to integrating psychophysiological signals into gameplay.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley, Jefferson Lab, and the National Institute ofAerospace have jointlydeveloped new BNNT-based materials with desirable piezoelectric and electrostrictiveproperties. BNNTs are a direct analog of carbon nanotubes, with superior properties formany applications. They are as strong as carbon nanotubes (within a few percentagepoints) and are good thermal conductors. The newly developed materials have desirableelectroactive characteristics, which make them suitable for use in electromechanicalenergy conversion devices. The novel materials developed in this joint collaboration arehighly flexible, mechanically robust, and thermally stable, all desirable features forelectromechanical energy conversion devices, such as sensors, actuators, and energyharvesting devices.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Membership.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to American National Standards Institute (ANSI), unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they obtain similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Bryan O'Shaughnessy (bposhaughnessy@usgs.gov) no later than 12:00 PM EST, Tuesday, April 10, 2012 with an affirmative answer.  
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contract Specialist attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained. SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:Part of the mission of the USGS is to produce information that enables the US to manage its water resources and water-related infrastructure and to mediate the impacts of floods and droughts.  An important aspect of that effort requires access to information from other Nations.  The USGS seeks to standardize the collection of hydrologic data so that the hydrologic cycle, floods, droughts, etc. are easier to understand and assess. Better and more consistent international data also permits the USGS to better manage streamflow across borders and understand hydrologic responses to climate change. The primary standards making body in the world is the International Standards Organization (ISO) in which representatives of various countries collaborate to develop voluntary standards and data definitions.  ANSI is the only American affiliate of ISO (URL:http://www.iso.org/iso/about/iso_members.htm) and it is the only ISO-chartered organization that the USGS can participate in the international standards process.
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) is a 501(c)3 private, not-for-profit organization consisting of representatives of U.S. Federal, State, and local governmental agencies, companies, non-governmental organizations, and individuals who are organized into technical advisory groups to engage similarly organized representatives of other countries to discuss, create, and revise voluntary standards pertaining to various manufacturing, trade, or information products with the goal of promoting the widespread and easy exchange of these products.  
It has been determined by the program office, through market research conducted in December 2011 via internet searches, that there are no other alternative organizations or resellers of this membership.  ANSI is the only American affiliate of the ISO.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Project Title:</p>
<p>Data Transfer Application for the Gulf of Mexico Reef fish Bottom Longline Monitoring Observer Program Database</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an electronic reporting system for at-sea observer data, providing real-time quota monitoring for the bottom longline portion of the Gulf of Mexico grouper/snapper/tilefish fishery.</p>
<p>1. Development of a computer application (IOS and Android platforms) integrating GPS and photographs using a tablet to enter data at-sea</p>
<p>2. Development of data transfer protocol between at-sea observer data application and central MS Access/Oracle database using VMS or satellite email</p>
<p>3. Generation of daily data summary for real-time quota monitoring capabilities</p>
<p>4. Ensure application and data summary file secured as 128 bit AES used for encryption with integrated quality control mechanism at the data entry and data output level</p>
<p>5. Synchronization of primary and foreign keys between systems</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The NMFS-Southeast Fisheries Science Center-Panama City Laboratory Observer Program monitors catch and bycatch on bottom longline vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. South Atlantic. An established methodology has been developed but modifications to the current means of data acquisition and entry are in development. Part of this program development includes converting the current observer database from an Access database to an Oracle database with a web based graphic user interface (GUI), which would be housed at the Southeast Fisheries Science. The impetus for the database conversion is for more integrated data entry and data access by parties including the observer program, quota monitors, and managers. To reduce the time and resources needed between data collection and data entry, developments of applications that facilitate the exchange of observer data between a remote version of the database contained on a computer and the central database are needed. This would allow an observer to enter and transmit data while at-sea from a vessel with email capability, using either an existing vessel monitoring system (VMS) or satellite transmission. Real-time quota monitoring especially under a catch share program is the end goal, but currently not available due to the lack of electronic reporting capabilities in the observer program.</p>
<p>Proposed work:</p>
<p>To reduce the time and resources needed between data collection and data entry, developments of applications that facilitate the exchange of observer data between a remote version of a database contained on a computer and the central database are needed. This would allow an observer to enter and transmit data while at-sea from a vessel with email capability, using either an existing vessel monitoring system (VMS) or satellite transmission. An individual contract would be provided to a software developer to design an at-sea data entry based application for IOS and Android platforms with integrated photographs and GPS coordinates. The applications must be able to produce a daily data summary that is sent via satellite email and easily imported into MS Access or Oracle databases. The application and data summary file should be secured as 128 bit AES used for encryption with integrated quality control mechanism at the data entry and data output level. The contracted individual may be required to work with existing architecture and staff such as ones already existing (e.g. Office of Science and Technology, Fisheries Scientific Computing System). The application would consist of three primary components: computer initialization and application design, VMS or satellite encrypted data transmission, and synchronization of primary and foreign keys between systems.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor will have experience with the following skills:</p>
<p>1) Designing applications for IOS and Android platforms including full integration of camera and GPS data</p>
<p>2) Experience with peripheral satellite uplink communication</p>
<p>3) Experience back-engineering windows modem software for satellite phones</p>
<p>4) Experience designing and implementing MS Access and Oracle databases</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor will provide:</p>
<p>1) Working data-entry application for the IOS and Android platforms including GPS and photograph integration, security encryption, and synchronization of primary and foreign keys between remote data application and Access/Oracle database</p>
<p>2) Working connectivity between data-entry application, hardware, and satellite email uplink</p>
<p>3) Testing of data-entry application with observer program and any needed support over long-term<br />Schedule of Work</p>
<p>The contractor(s) will provide these services and products as follows:<br /><br />1) Development of data-entry application (with all requirements listed above) over 6-12 month period including testing and implementation</p>
<p>2) Support over 12 month period after initial application development</p>

QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 7. The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply. OFFERORS PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractors date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>

<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in the notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR PART 13.106 for the attached requirements under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation number is 1101571. The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-56, March 2, 2012.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services - SIC 8748 Agriculture Consulting Services.</p>
<p>Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will only be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration is soliciting quotes for Feed Hazard Identification Control Guidance for Industry.</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Background<br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in August 2003 its intention to make its animal feed safety regulatory program more risk-based and comprehensive. The modernized Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS) will incorporate risk-based, preventive control measures for ensuring the safety of animal feed.</p>
<p>The work of the AFSS Team is guided by an Overview Document (formerly a Framework Document), first drafted in 2005, that identifies the current processes, guidance, regulations and policy documents that address feed safety and the documents that should be developed to make the Agency's feed safety program comprehensive and risk-based. The Framework Document has been revised multiple times and will undergo additional revisions as needed.</p>
<p>One of the on-going projects identified in the AFSS Overview Document is the development of preventive control rules for animal feed, which is mandated by the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011. A critical component of the draft proposed rule is the need for feed facilities to develop feed safety plans, which are needed to ensure prevention of feed hazard episodes. These proposed regulations are presently in clearance at the DHHS and OMB.</p>
<p>Critical to each step in the process are the identification of potential feed hazards and the implementation of steps to ensure that the hazards are controlled so they do not present an unacceptable risk to animal or human health. The FDA plans to release guidance on feed hazard identification and control to assist manufacturers and transporters of animal feed to comply with this requirement and thereby ensure the safety of their feed products. One challenge in drafting the proposed rule is defining terms in a way that takes into account the fact that the presence of certain feed hazards in animal feed or the existence of certain conditions of feed does not always pose a significant risk to animal or human health. <br />Duties<br />The Contractor shall provide expert services to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) for development of guidance for industry which explains how to identify feed hazards of concern and steps to control the presence of feed hazards in feed products so animal or human health is not compromised. Specifically, the Contractor will be responsible for the timely drafting of guidance documents and efficient revision of the documents based on comments from the AFSS Team.</p>
<p>The Contractor should have extensive experience and knowledge regarding the presence of feed hazards in animal feed and the measures the feed industry has at its disposal for handling such hazards. The Contractor needs to understand the principles of risk and relative risk assessment. Also, the Contractor needs wide-ranging knowledge of the regulatory and stakeholder groups that could be impacted by the guidance. Furthermore, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of the feed industry as it currently exists and operates, as well as the goals, objectives and premises of the AFSS. The Contractor will need to be available to travel on occasion.</p>
<p>Location<br />The work will take place at the contractor's place of business and on occasion at CVM, 7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD.<br />Equipment Use<br />No government funded nor extraordinary equipment is needed.<br />Period of Performance <br />One Base Year from time of Award - with 2 One (1) year Option Periods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this contract to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor described to "Meet or Exceed the Requirement," and 2) Price. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the award process, ALL quotes shall include a statement regarding the terms and conditions herein. Additionally, all quotes shall include price (s); FOB point; a poc (name and telephone number); a statement from the offeror verifying that they are CCR Registered under NAICS Code 541690. In addition, both the Cost Proposal and Technical Proposal shall not exceed 10 pages total.</p>
<p>FDA intends to make an award soon after the response date of this notice and all bids must be submitted via email and be received by 4:30 PM (1630) EST on April 23, 2012</p>
<p><br />ALL QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SYNOPSIS/SOLICIATION MUST BE SUBMITTED IN WRITING NO LATER THAN 4:30 PM (1630) EST ON APRIL 19, 2012.</p>
<p>FAX QUOTES SHALL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

These records will be available for the general public to search against and require a high-performance search engine that can handle the volume of requests as well as return the results to meet performance requirements. <br />The FDA is currently implementing the Unique Device Identification Database (UDID). The database requires a high-performance search tool to provide satisfactory response to the queries from the medical device manufacturers, healthcare providers, and the public users. <br /><br />Current Environment<br />The FDA has integrated the open-source Lucene/Apache Solr software. The FDA has implemented the required infrastructure (hardware, storage, network, etc.) for the Apache Server for Lucene/Solr software, built a database index, and created an extensive user interface to search records in the UDID database. The user interface addresses multiple audiences which include medical device manufacturers, labelers, healthcare providers, and the public. <br />The proposed solution shall be compatible with the above mentioned software. If vendor is proposing an alternative solution to the LucidWorks, brand name or equal to product, vendor shall be responsible for getting the FDA to a level of work that is equal to the current environment.</p>
<p>Scope<br />The FDA requires a highly scalable software, brand name or equal to the Lucid Works product and services. If an alternative solution is proposed, vendor shall ensure the product meets all of the following salient functional characteristics -<br /><br />o Vendor shall provide the Lucid Works, brand name or equal to software to the UDID team at FDA.<br /><br />o Solution shall be compatible with the already integrated open-source Lucene/Apache Solr software.<br /><br />o Solution shall be a highly scalable search engine, providing distributed search and index replication.<br /><br />o Product shall provide Out-Of-Box Support for: Full-Text search, Hit Highlighting, Faceted Search, Dynamic Clustering, Database Integration, Rich Document (e.g. Word, PDF, etc.) Handling, Fuzzy, Soundex, Misspelled, Boolean Searches. <br /><br />o Product shall have the capabilities for RESTful HTTP/XML Web Services and JSON APIs for easy integration into applications. <br /><br />o Solution shall have the capabilities for external configuration and extensive plug-in architecture for advanced customization. <br /><br />o Solution shall have a variety of connector support for: Database, Sharepoint, Hadoop, XML, Web, File System, and Google Connector.<br />&nbsp;<br />o Product shall have built - in monitoring tools of search usage.

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br />Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Parts 7.2 and 7.4 of the SOW.&nbsp; If an offer does not contain adequate information to make this determination, it will be considered&nbsp;non-responsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. - PRICE The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br />Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. . The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 12, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

All proposals shall reference the RFQ number and shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. local (central) time on 3 May 2012. The anticipated award date is 11 May 2012. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses for commercial items in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-57, dated 7 March 2012.  This acquisition is open for Full & Open Competition. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 611519 size standard of $7.0m. Contract line item numbers and quantities: CLIN 0001, Base Period (FY 12) for Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 16 course iterations; CLIN 0002, Option Year #1 (FY 13) for Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 16 course iterations; CLIN 0003, Option Year #2 (FY 14) for Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 16 course iterations; CLIN 0004, Option Year #3 (FY 15) for Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 16 course iterations; CLIN 0005, Option Year #4 (FY 16) for Highway Drug Investigations for Patrol, 16 course iterations; Vendors shall review the Statement of Work for a detailed list of course requirements and items to be submitted as part of their proposal.  The prices provided for each of the CLINS above shall include all labor, material, travel costs, supervision, and associated services to carry out the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center's (MCTC) mission requirements as defined in the Statement of Work. Clarification for CLINS 0001-0005: the vendor's pricing for each CLIN shall be all-inclusive of any applicable taxes, fees, and the mandatory Contractor Manpower Reporting fee; every vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR). The vendor may apply a price to the CMR CLINs or may opt to complete the mandatory reporting at no cost to the Government. However, as a clear indicator of vendor's intention, CLIN pricing must reflect a zero cost if vendor chooses to waive the CMR Reporting fee. Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language that follows; it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the Contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The Contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the format using the following web address: https://cmra.army.mil. The required information includes: (1) Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Technical Representative; (2) Contract number, including task and delivery order number; (3) Beginning and ending dates covered by reporting period; (4) Contractor name, address, phone number, e-mail address, identity of Contractor employee entering data; (5) Estimated direct labor hours (including sub-Contractors); (6) Estimated direct labor dollars paid this reporting period (including sub-Contractors); (7) Total payments (including sub-Contractors); (8) Predominant Federal Service Code (FSC) reflecting services provided by Contractor (and separate predominant FSC for each sub-Contractor if different); (9) Estimated data collection costs; (10) Organizational title associated with the Unit Identification Code (UIC) for the Army Requiring Activity (the Army Requiring Activity is responsible for providing the Contractor with its UIC for the purposes of reporting this information); (11) Locations where Contractor and sub-Contractors perform the work (specified by zip code in the United States and nearest city, country, when in an overseas location, using standardized nomenclature provided on website); (12) Presence of deployment or contingency contract language; and (13) Number of contractor and sub-contractor employees deployed in theater this reporting period (by country). As part of its submission, the Contractor will also provide the estimated total cost (if any) incurred to comply with this reporting requirement.  Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 September of each government fiscal year and must be reported by 31 October of each calendar year.   Contractors may use a direct XML data transfer to the database server or fill in the fields on the website. The XML direct transfer is a format for transferring files from a contractor's systems to the secure website without the need for separate data entries for each required data element at the website. The specific formats for the XML direct transfer may be downloaded from the website. The CMRA web site maintains a "Frequently Asked Questions and Answers" https://cmra.army.mil/ that is updated periodically.  Any technical or implementation questions not addressed on this site can be discussed and coordinated through the CMR Help Desk at 703-377-6199, or https://cmra.army.mil. IMPORTANT!!! Information must be reported within 30 business days after the completion of each course and before the submission of any invoices, whichever timeframe is first. The following provisions apply to this solicitation: 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (by reference); 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (by full text): (a) The Government will award a firm-fixed priced contract resulting from this solicitation  to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Best Value is the most advantageous offer, price and other factors considered with the Government's stated importance of evaluation criteria. The Technical factors will include Course Content and Materials and Instructor Qualifications. Technical and Past Performance factors are approximately equal; when combined, Technical and Past Performance factors are significantly more important than Price. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions, therefore, Offeror's initial proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
<p>Project Title:</p>
<p>Data Transfer Application for the Gulf of Mexico Reef fish Bottom Longline Monitoring Observer Program Database</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop an electronic reporting system for at-sea observer data, providing real-time quota monitoring for the bottom longline portion of the Gulf of Mexico grouper/snapper/tilefish fishery.</p>
<p>1. Development of a computer application (IOS and Android platforms) integrating GPS and photographs using a tablet to enter data at-sea</p>
<p>2. Development of data transfer protocol between at-sea observer data application and central MS Access/Oracle database using VMS or satellite email</p>
<p>3. Generation of daily data summary for real-time quota monitoring capabilities</p>
<p>4. Ensure application and data summary file secured as 128 bit AES used for encryption with integrated quality control mechanism at the data entry and data output level</p>
<p>5. Synchronization of primary and foreign keys between systems</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>The NMFS-Southeast Fisheries Science Center-Panama City Laboratory Observer Program monitors catch and bycatch on bottom longline vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and U.S. South Atlantic. An established methodology has been developed but modifications to the current means of data acquisition and entry are in development. Part of this program development includes converting the current observer database from an Access database to an Oracle database with a web based graphic user interface (GUI), which would be housed at the Southeast Fisheries Science. The impetus for the database conversion is for more integrated data entry and data access by parties including the observer program, quota monitors, and managers. To reduce the time and resources needed between data collection and data entry, developments of applications that facilitate the exchange of observer data between a remote version of the database contained on a computer and the central database are needed. This would allow an observer to enter and transmit data while at-sea from a vessel with email capability, using either an existing vessel monitoring system (VMS) or satellite transmission. Real-time quota monitoring especially under a catch share program is the end goal, but currently not available due to the lack of electronic reporting capabilities in the observer program.</p>
<p>Proposed work:</p>
<p>To reduce the time and resources needed between data collection and data entry, developments of applications that facilitate the exchange of observer data between a remote version of a database contained on a computer and the central database are needed. This would allow an observer to enter and transmit data while at-sea from a vessel with email capability, using either an existing vessel monitoring system (VMS) or satellite transmission. An individual contract would be provided to a software developer to design an at-sea data entry based application for IOS and Android platforms with integrated photographs and GPS coordinates. The applications must be able to produce a daily data summary that is sent via satellite email and easily imported into MS Access or Oracle databases. The application and data summary file should be secured as 128 bit AES used for encryption with integrated quality control mechanism at the data entry and data output level. The contracted individual may be required to work with existing architecture and staff such as ones already existing (e.g. Office of Science and Technology, Fisheries Scientific Computing System). The application would consist of three primary components: computer initialization and application design, VMS or satellite encrypted data transmission, and synchronization of primary and foreign keys between systems.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>The contractor will have experience with the following skills:</p>
<p>1) Designing applications for IOS and Android platforms including full integration of camera and GPS data</p>
<p>2) Experience with peripheral satellite uplink communication</p>
<p>3) Experience back-engineering windows modem software for satellite phones</p>
<p>4) Experience designing and implementing MS Access and Oracle databases</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The contractor will provide:</p>
<p>1) Working data-entry application for the IOS and Android platforms including GPS and photograph integration, security encryption, and synchronization of primary and foreign keys between remote data application and Access/Oracle database</p>
<p>2) Working connectivity between data-entry application, hardware, and satellite email uplink</p>
<p>3) Testing of data-entry application with observer program and any needed support over long-term</p>
<p>Schedule of Work</p>
<p>The contractor(s) will provide these services and products as follows:</p>
<p>1) Development of data-entry application (with all requirements listed above) over 6-12 month period including testing and implementation</p>
<p>2) Support over 12 month period after initial application development</p>

Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to negotiate a non-competitive firm-fixed price award with NATIONAL COUNCIL ON RADIATION PROTECTION AND MEASUREMENTS. 

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) to maintain an essential research capability to be provided by a nonprofit institution. As stated in the FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii)  Full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center. 

The NCRP is charted by Congress to perform the following duties:  

a.Collect, analyze, develop and disseminate in the public interest information and recommendations about:

1)Protection against radiation.
2)Radiation measurements, quantities, and units 

b.Provide a means by which organizations concerned with the scientific and related aspects of radiation protection and of radiation quantities, units and measurements may cooperate for effective utilization of their combined resources and to stimulate the work of such organizations.

c.Develop basic concepts about radiation quantities, units, and measurements, about the application of these concepts, and about radiation protection.

d.Cooperate with the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements, other national and international organizations.
 Cooperate with Governmental and private industries concerned with radiation quantities, units and measurements with radiation protection.

As per FAR 6.301 (a)(2)(iii) states  For DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NSWCCD has been obtaining these same services and technical reports from the NCRP since 1989 under Contract numbers N60921-89-C-0121, N60921-92-C-0137, N00167-96-C-4005, N00167-98-C-0059 and N00167-07-M-5119.
 The reports submitted by the NCRP have guided the Navys research scientist on different topics of radiation detection, protection and instrumentation.

<p>(End of provision addendum)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (Addendum)</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />An IDIQ will be awarded to the company determined to represent the overall best value to the USCG. IAW FAR 15.101-1, the Government will determine the best value using the tradeoff process. The tradeoff process will lead to an award decision that is made between the following price and non-priced evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach<br />Factor 2: Relevant Past Performance<br />Factor 3: Socio-Economic Factors <br />Factor 4: Price</p>
<p>The evaluation factors listed above are in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors are more important than price. When combined, the evaluation factors are significantly more important than price. Technical approach is more important than past performance and socio-economic factors. However, as the technical approach, past performance, and socio-economic factors converge, the price may become more important.</p>
<p>For each factor, offerors are required to provide the information described below:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Evaluation: The Government will evaluate each Offeror's technical proposal to determine their capacity to perform all the requirements outlined in the PWS, which will include an evaluation of the following: the Offeror's proposed course curriculum, facilities and equipment that include course labs or hands-on training equivalents, and instructor qualifications.</p>
<p>Factor 2- Relevant Past Performance: The Government will evaluate the past performance of the offeror for relevancy. The offeror shall provide past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the proposals received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG reserves the right to also consider other ways to evaluate past performance.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Socio-Economic Factors:</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 <br />The Government will evaluate the offeror's small business subcontracting plan. As small businesses are not required to submit a small business subcontracting plan, small business offerors will receive the highest rating for this factor. Large businesses that do not plan to submit a small business subcontracting plan must submit a signed statement that states why they will not subcontract any work of the resultant contract. Doing so will receive a neutral rating and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably. Large businesses' submitted subcontracting plans will be evaluated as to the degree to which the subcontracting plan meets fiscal year 2012 USCG small business subcontracting goals, which are stated as follows: <br />- 45% Small businesses <br />- 5% Small disadvantaged businesses<br />- 5% Women owned small businesses<br />- 3% HUBZone businesses<br />- 3% Small disadvantaged veteran owned small businesses</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 <br />Large businesses offeror's history of compliance with subcontracting reporting requirements in other federal contracts and how well the large businesses have met planned small business subcontracting goals in previous award will be evaluated. If a large business does not submit a small business subcontracting plan they will receive a neutral rating and will not be rated favorably or unfavorably. This will be evaluated using the Electronic Subcontract Reporting System at http://www.esrs.gov</p>
<p>Overall rating for Factor Three will be at the factor level. Both sub-factors are of equal importance and contribute to the overall Factor rating.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Price: The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness.<br /><br />Evaluation Ratings:</p>
<p>Technical evaluation ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;SUPERIOR - Exceeds specified minimum requirements of the solicitation in a way very beneficial to the Government. Proposal/Quote is superior in many, if not all, respects and reflects no weaknesses, significant weaknesses, or deficiencies. Must reflect one or more significant strengths. Offer demonstrates a complete understanding of the requirement. The proposal/quote presents a very high probability of successful performance.<br />&bull;EXCELLENT - Meets the requirements, one or more strengths to the Government. Weaknesses, if any, are of small impact and correctable; and no significant weaknesses or deficiencies are present. The proposal/quote presents a high probability of success.<br />&bull;SATISFACTORY - Meets all requirements; proposal/quote offers no significant benefits beyond the stated requirements, and has no significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />&bull;MARGINAL - Fails to meet the minimum requirements or has one or more weaknesses or significant weaknesses. Significant weaknesses are correctable without major revisions to the proposal/quote.<br />&bull;UNSATISFACTORY - Fails to meet the minimum requirements; has one or more deficiencies that require major revisions or redirection of the proposal/quote.</p>
<p>Past Performance evaluation ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;EXCELLENT - One or more examples where past performance significantly exceeded requirements.<br />&bull;SATISFACTORY - Past performance met requirements.<br />&bull;NO RATING - The contractor has no relevant past performance.<br />&bull;MARGINAL - One or more examples where past performance failed to meet requirements due to fault of contractor<br />&bull;UNSATISFACTORY - One or more examples where past performance significantly failed to meet requirements due to fault of contractor</p>
<p>Socio-Economy evaluation ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>&bull;EXCEEDS - 46% or more of the work is subcontracted out exceeding the 45% goal and at least one of the 5% or 3% goals.<br />&bull;MEETS - At least 95% of the work that is subcontracted is to small businesses and at least one of the 5% or 3% goals are met or 100% of the subcontracting is to small businesses.<br />&bull;DOES NOT MEET - Satisfactory effort is not undertaken towards meeting subcontracting goals for the work available for subcontracting.<br />&bull;NEUTRAL - None of the work is subcontracted.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)</p>

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>The following HSAR clauses are incorporated in full:</p>
<p>HSAR 3052.209-70 Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.<br />Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:</p>
<p>Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.</p>
<p>Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)-</p>
<p>(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;</p>
<p>(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-</p>
<p>(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or</p>
<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.<br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>
<p>(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or</p>
<p>(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).</p>
<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
<p>(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special rule for related partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.</p>
<p>(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:</p>
<p>(i) warrants;<br />(ii) options;<br />(iii) contracts to acquire stock;<br />(iv) convertible debt instruments; and<br />(v) others similar interests.</p>
<p>(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.</p>
<p>(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that:</p>
<p>__ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.108-7001 through 3009.108-7003;</p>

<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>HSAR 3052.209-72 - Organization Conflict of Interest (Jun 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Determination. The Government has determined that this effort may result in an actual or potential conflict of interest, or may provide one or more offerors with the potential to attain an unfair competitive advantage. The nature of the conflict of interest and the limitation on future contracting is currently unknown.</p>
<p>(b) If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the Contracting Officer may:</p>
<p>(1) Disqualify the offeror, or</p>
<p>(2) Determine that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to contract with the offeror and include the appropriate provisions to avoid, neutralize, mitigate, or waive such conflict in the contract awarded. After discussion with the offeror, the<br />Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.</p>
<p>(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that: ___</p>
<p>(1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or ___</p>
<p>(2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.</p>
<p>(d) Mitigation. If an offeror with a potential or actual conflict of interest or unfair competitive advantage believes the conflict can be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the offeror shall submit a mitigation plan to the Government for review. Award of a contract where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists shall not occur before Government approval of the mitigation plan. If a mitigation plan is approved, the restrictions of this provision do not apply to the extent defined in the mitigation plan.</p>
<p>(e) Other Relevant Information: In addition to the mitigation plan, the Contracting Officer may require further relevant information from the offeror. The Contracting Officer will use all information submitted by the offeror, and any other relevant information known to DHS, to determine whether an award to the offeror may take place, and whether the mitigation plan adequately neutralizes or mitigates the conflict.</p>
<p>(f) Corporation Change. The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.</p>
<p>(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>HSAR 3052.242-72 - Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (DEC 2003)</p>
<p>(a) The Contracting Officer may designate Government personnel to act as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) to perform functions under the contract such as review or inspection and acceptance of supplies, services, including construction, and other functions of a technical nature. The Contracting Officer will provide a written notice of such designation to the Contractor within five working days after contract award or for construction, not less than five working days prior to giving the contractor the notice to proceed. The designation letter will set forth the authorities and limitations of the COTR under the contract.</p>
<p>(b) The Contracting Officer cannot authorize the COTR or any other representative to sign documents, such as contracts, contract modifications, etc., that require the signature of the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman<br />Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman<br />Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.</p>
<p>If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

<p>The base year period of performance is 01 May 2012 through 30 April 2013. The government contemplates awarding a contract with one base year plus four option years. If all options are exercised, performance under this contract will conclude on 30 April 2017. The place of performance is Air Force Research Laboratory/Rome Research Site, Rome, NY 13441.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal SITE VISIT will be conducted at 8:00 AM (EST) on MONDAY 2 APRIL 2012. Contact Bryant Soule, Contract Specialist (315-330-4723 or bryant.soule@rl.af.mil), no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on FRIDAY 30 MARCH 2012 to ensure site access. All attending parties must be identified so security forms and gate clearances can be processed.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (FEB 2012), applies to this acquisition. Addenda to the following paragraphs of 52.212-1 are:</p>
<p>(b) Written proposals are due by 3:00 PM (EST) on 11 April 2012. Submit to: AFRL/RIKO, Attn: Bryant Soule, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 or by facsimile to: 315-330-2555 or by email to bryant.soule@rl.af.mil.</p>
<p>(b)(10) The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offerors' performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this RFP. Offerors shall submit past performance information to include recent and relevant contracts which demonstrate the ability of the offeror to perform the proposed effort. Please provide past performance information for no more than five (5) relevant contracts performed for Government agencies and commercial customers within the last three (3) years. To the maximum extent practicable, identify contracts for properties which are not owned or operated by your firm or by key personnel, including intended subcontractors, of your firm. <br />Referenced past performance information should include contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers, and a narrative explaining the contract's relevancy to the solicitation.</p>
<p>To be considered RELEVANT, performance must meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract efforts that required mowing, edging, trimming, pruning, policing, and leaf removal of a lawn area at least 10 acres in size.</p>
<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to receive a contract award. If the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database within four (4) days after receiving notification from the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror. Information may be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov or 888-227-2423.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) applies. In addition to the information in paragraph (a), the following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (i) PRICE and (ii) PAST PERFORMANCE. After considering all past performance data gathered by the Government for this solicitation, an offeror's past performance will be assigned a confidence rating based on the list below:</p>
<p>-Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-No Confidence: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>-Unknown Confidence: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history, or a performance record that is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a Substantial Confidence performance confidence assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. The Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p><br />The representations and certifications in the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2012) and Alternate I (APR 2011) must be completed electronically on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bpn.gov.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 10.  The Government will evaluate equally, as regards time of delivery, offers that propose delivery of each quantity within the applicable delivery period specified above. Offers that propose delivery that will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. The Government reserves the right to award under either the required delivery schedule or the proposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the required delivery schedule above will apply. OFFEROR?S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE ITEM NO. QUANTITY WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT 0001 215 (b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor?s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term ?working day? excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. (End of Clause)<BR><BR>

<DESC>This synopsis/solicitation amendment provides response to the following question?<br><br>Why does the requirement for Organizational Development and Change Management Training require consultants to be a graduate of the Triple Impact Practitioner Program? Would it be more desirable to have a Triple Impact trained consultant with a master's degree and a minimum of two years of experience than to have much more experienced and educated contractors who are not trained in this very specific approach?  <br><br><br>Triple Impact is currently the foundational and conversational approach the AMEDD is adopting as the institution transforms into a High Reliability Organization.  Triple Impact is also the basis for a "common language" for our internal consultant staff, and introducing a new approach with a new language is potentially disruptive to achieving the AMEDD goals, within a specified timeframe, dictated by senior leadership. <br><br>The response date to submit a quote remains the same 4:00 pm CST 11 April 12.    <br>

ASC/WINPA is conducting market research to identify what research has been accomplished in this field as well as to see what technology currently exists or could be modified for this need. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY14-24 timeframe. ASC/WIN seeks industry white papers to support this market research effort by&nbsp;8 May 12. The intent of this RFI is to identify potential candidate programs and technology efforts related to the development of end-to-end ISR functionality of sensors and associated data algorithms. Components related to ISR sensors include, but are not limited to: electronics, gimbals, cryogenics, diffraction gratings, focusing lenses, FPAs, ROICs, atmospheric and temperature correction algorithms/techniques, airborne processing, interference filters, spectrometer, HRI subsystems, etc. These components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system. Responses are sought from industry, academia, Government agencies, and military services. Current research should indicate the Technology Readiness Level of the system or component.<br /><br />ASC/WIN desires this market research across industry, academia and service/Government programs for candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future airborne GEOINT sensors and end-to-end functionality. Candidate technologies should, if needed, project modifications or upgrades, forecast improvements or apply new technology process in order to meet operational goals. The following ground rules/assumptions apply:<br /><br />&bull; For solely component technologies - clearly explain how the component will benefit end-to-end sensor functionality<br />&bull; If applicable, responses shall identify and new supporting architecture or infrastructure (i.e. cryogenics, processing/PED, computer resources, storage requirements (environmental requirements), ground control, communications, etc.) required for the technology;<br />&bull; If applicable, responses shall identify and Unique Tool and/or Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), as well as any proven integration (have they been flown/tested?);<br />&bull; Responses shall identify technical and security POCs.<br /><br />All correspondence submitted will be controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted White Papers, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities. <br /><br />The Government anticipates the information will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support airborne GEOINT objectives.<br /><br />The Government invites industry to submit White Papers (unclassified or classified up to TOP SECRET) on their concepts or technologies at any time on or before 1 May 12. Guidance on the suggested White Paper format is attached. Please ensure all appropriate security procedures and policies are followed when responding to this RFI.

Also, all attendees and interested parties will be posted to FedBizOpps.

PRIME BIDDERS are requested to attend because OO-ALC will only partner with the prime contractor in this effort and not with any potential sub-contractors. This is because OO-ALC has been designated as the government's organic depot candidate for the GCS software maintenance portion of this new contract action.</span></p>

<DESC>**NOTICE TO INDUSTRY ON ERRONEOUS CANCELLATION**<br /><br />On 21 Feb this notice was erroneously cancelled.&nbsp; This notice and subject requirement remains active and is NOT cancelled.&nbsp; We are working to rescind the "Cancellation" Notice within the FedBiz Opps.gov website.<br /><br />Any further clarification on the status should be directed to Lt Col Michael Dombrowski at <a href="mailto:michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil">michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil</a> .<br /><br /><br />THIS IS AN ANNOUNCMENT FOR AN INDUSTRY DAY TO PERFORM MARKET RESEARCH PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISTION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for any information solicited or provided as a result of this notice. The result of the market research process may be used, however, to develop the scope for potential future RFPs. This is not a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP nor pay any proposal or proposal preparation costs.
<p>The Government will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by an Industry Day participant for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts, data offered for examination, or any other expense associated with attendance.</p>
<p>The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Contracting Directorate is hosting an Industry Day on 3 February 2012 at 9:00 (EST) on Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. All information presented during this event will be UNCLASSIFIED. The Industry Day will allow the AFDW to determine the range, scope, capabilities and capacity of potential commercial partners to include small businesses to support future Air Force National Capital Region Information Technology (AFNCR IT) Services. See attachment for further information on the scope of current contracted efforts. The AFDW is seeking industry input with innovative ideas, tools &amp; technology, in support of a full range of unclassified and classified mission essential IT services to the Department of Defense users.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates this requirement will be solicited under its "NETCENTS 2" multiple-award contract vehicle but may ultimately be solicited in any manner consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>Pre-registration for the AFNCR IT Industry Day is required. Attendance at Industry Day is limited to a maximum of 2 individuals per organization. To register for Industry Day, request a One-on-One* meeting with the Government team and submit questions about this requirement email Mr. Sebastian Kaiser-Vu at Sebastian.kaiser-vu@afncr.af.mil with courtesy copies sent to afncr.contract.pmo@pentagon.af.mil and michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil. Upon registration, participants will be sent additional details as to specific location and agenda.</p>
<p>Emails shall include:</p>
<p>1) Subject line of email: "AFNCR IT Industry Day RSVP";<br />2) Organization name, address, and CAGE Code;<br />3) List of Organization attendees to include name, email, and phone numbers of each**;<br />4) Organization's request for one-on-one meeting participation, if desired.<br />a. Industry partners from out-of-town locations will receive priority with one-on-one meeting scheduling due to the cost of travel. This does will not exclude any industry partners from scheduling one-on-one meetings with the Government. One-on-one meetings will be scheduled on a first-come-first serve basis.<br />b. The Government is seeking to foster dialogue with industry on new and innovative ideas/approaches to meet its requirements but does not want purely marketing presentations.</p>
<p>Registrations by telephone will not be accepted. Security clearances are not required for this event. The deadline for submitting registrations requests is 31 January 12 to allow sufficient time to process visitor requests for base access.</p>
<p>*All registered participants are asked to submit proposed questions in advance of Industry Day to Mr. Sebastian Kaiser-Vu at Sebastian.kaiser-vu@afncr.af.mil with courtesy copies sent to afncr.contract.pmo@pentagon.af.mil and michael.dombrowski@afncr.af.mil.</p>
<p>** Ensure all attendees bring a valid driver's license for identification purposes at the base main gate. If any of the attendees are not U.S. Citizens, please include this in your registration email, as he/she will need a military escort to receive access onto the base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>**NOTICE TO INDUSTRY ON ERRONEOUS CANCELLATION**</p>
<p>On 21 Feb this notice was erroneously cancelled. This notice and subject requirement remains active and is NOT cancelled. We are working to rescind the "Cancellation" Notice within the FedBiz Opps.gov website.</p>

<DESC>Title:  Herbicide Application via Helicopter at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), Suffolk (Suffolk Co.), Virginia

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (U.S.F.W.S.) has a requirement for aerial application via helicopter of herbicides to control and eradicate target species Phragmites australis in the footprint of the Lateral West Wildfire, which burned 6,377 acres at the Great Dismal Swamp NWR in August, 2011. This contract will provide control of Phragmites in an area covering approximately 1,395 acres.
The work under this contract consists of furnishing all necessary equipment, labor and materials necessary to accomplish the specified vegetative control and eradication. Contractor shall furnish necessary herbicide and surfactant. The herbicide applications will consist of two separate spray missions: 1) to apply a combination of glyphosate and imazapyr products to all phragmites australis populations identified for treatment; and 2) a late season survey and clean up spray to apply imazapyr product to surviving clones of Phragmites. The contractor performing the spraying work must have on-board GPS (AgNav system). The contractor will be provided with spatial data (shapefiles) indicating the areas to be sprayed. 
Insurance:  The contractor will carry liability insurance that will cover the application of pesticides as defined in the specifications. This coverage will include as a minimum, drift, run-off, and pollution (sudden and accidental) for all contract operations. The amount of coverage this insurance will provide will not be less than $1,000,000. per incident.
The estimated magnitude of this project is between $25,000. and $100,000. This acquisition shall be competed as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 115112. The small business size standard is $7 million. 
The Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about April 3, 2012. The solicitation will only be available electronically at www.fbo.gov. Proposals will be due on May 4, 2012 by 4:00 pm (EST). A Firm Fixed Price Contract is anticipated.
Interested contractors must be registered at the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) website at www.ccr.gov, and complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) at www.bpn.gov, to be eligible for award. Also, any payment requests under the awarded contract for this project must be submitted electronically through the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Internet Payment Platform System (IPP).

<DESC>PMS401 seeks information from industry entities about their capabilities and interest vis--vis the Common Acoustic Cabinet (CAC) to be procured under a small business set-aside, competitive contract.  The CAC will implement Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products and non-developmental item(s) (NDI). The CAC contains upgraded signal processing capability and is reconfigurable to support processing of multiple acoustic and array sensors.

 The CAC is one of many MIL-Spec, environmentally qualified, water-cooled cabinets employed by the Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) Program to house submarine sonar acoustic processing capabilities on SSN 688, 688I, SEAWOLF, VA CLASS and SSGN submarines.
   The CAC consists of a series of COTS-based, reconfigurable, high-performance computing servers, high-speed switch technologies, and technologies that power various sonar sensors and monitor cabinet status.  Hardware is refreshed periodically to mitigate obsolescence issues and implement reliability availability and maintainability (RAM) improvements.  
The CAC performs in extreme, submarine-based, operational conditions such as MIL-S 901D (Grade B) shock, MIL-E-461F electromagnetic compatibility,  0oC to 50oC ambient air temperature with a Relative Humidity of 95%,  and MIL-STD-167 vibration environments.  The CAC requires operation for both spray and drip environments at angles up to 45 per MIL-STD-108E.
All interested sources are encouraged to submit company and product literature, white paper, and/or other pertinent information for the Government's consideration.
  Relevant information shall include but is not limited to the criteria listed above. 

All interested sources are encouraged to respond by providing the Government the following information; technical/contractual points of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code and or tax ID number, as well as small business sub-category, a brief summary of the company's capabilities, description of facilities, personnel, related manufacturing experience, and quality assurance process.  Also, provide any supporting information such as commercial literature, catalogues, manuals, etc.  The response should also include all relevant business information, rough order of magnitude (ROM) costs are NOT required.
 

This Request for Information (RFI) in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the Government for information or materials provided. 

At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This request for information (RFI) does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract in connection with this announcement.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<p>U.S. Special Operations Command, Headquarters Procurement Division, 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL, 33621-5323</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Directorate of Procurement has a requirement to purchase a Non-Development Item (NDI) vehicle with Special Operations Forces (SOF) peculiar modifications. This vehicle will be a highly mobile, C/MH-47 transportable platform with associated manuals, spare parts, mechanical/operator training, and a Government furnished C4ISR suite. This procurement will be accomplished using full and open competition with the intent of awarding a seven year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type of contract, issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) delivery orders. Offerors will be required to provide a product sample as part of the proposal. The sample vehicle is not required to be fully production representative, however it must demonstrate that it is a mature design and with minor engineering effort, capable of meeting the production requirement. It is the Government's intent to release a Request for Proposal (RFP), H92222-12-R-0003, which will be posted on this FEDBIZOPPS (FBO) website in the weeks following this announcement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement&nbsp;is 336112,&nbsp;with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. A small business subcontracting plan is required for all offerors that do not meet the small business size standards under this NAICS.<br /><br />In order to be granted explicit access to the RFP package, Contractors must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) under at least one of the following NAICS codes: 336112, 336992, 336111, 336120, or 336999.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR).</p>
<p>This synopsis shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information. No other program information related to total dollars available, total quantity of vehicles authorized, or timeline for official solicitation is available at this time, other than as provided below. USSOCOM will continue to post information in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to FBO after finalization of the acquisition documents.</p>
<p>The Government has received recurring questions and comments from Industry relative to the Ground Mobility Vehicle Program. This announcement will address the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Budget<br />2. Quantities of Vehicles to be procured</p>
<p>Budget: The recurring questions have been regarding the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 and FY2013 President's Budget position, and its effect on the GMV1.1 acquisition. The Government will not address specific dollar figures by year. However, there are Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDTE) funds planned for this effort in FY12 and FY13, followed by procurement funds planned beginning in FY14.</p>
<p>Quantities of Vehicles to be procured: USSOCOM has an approved Capability Production Document (CPD) that requires 1297 GMV1.1 vehicles to achieve Full Operational Capability.</p>

<DESC><p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) intends to award, via modification P00004,&nbsp;a sole source contract to Central Parking System Inc, for 8 additional parking spaces, on the basis of other than full and open competition under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements". This modification is to provide 8 additional parking spaces in addition to the current contract for 100 spaces at the same facility, with 365/24/7 access for government employee vehicles.&nbsp; The Government has determined that Central Parking System, who owns and operates the parking garage is the only company capable of providing this service due to the limited sources for parking spaces within a close vicinity of the required work location. Close proximity parking is necessary due to physical limitations of some employees and security purposes. The Government intends to negotiate solely with Central Parking Systems.
