<SUBJECT>70 -- Clearpath HW Maintenance Services
<DESC>This serves as a ?Notice of Intent? to purchase Relativity Cobol Mining maintenance for existing software licenses .  This Notice is SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FY 2007 FUNDS pursuant to FAR Clause 52.232-18.  This notice does not obligate funds.  The Government intends to purchase open market Hardware maintenance services under a GSA Schedule task order for mainframe hosting services:  

The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has the responsibility of providing the information technology required to support its business lines.  For decades, a key component in the development of these systems has been based the Unisys ClearPath Enterprise Server platform. A redundant pair of these mainframe computers are located in Eagan, MN and Salt Lake City UT. Six of seven OMB-300 ?majors? run on the ClearPath computers, and the majority of all computing FAS undertakes is served by them.

In February 2002 a competitive procurement under GSA Schedule 70 (in accordance with FAR 8.4) was awarded to Unisys under the GSA Blanket Purchase Agreement (entitled, ?GSAS) for the purchase and installation of the ClearPath mainframe technology.  Unisys was the one of the competitive solutions considered and recommended by the technical evaluation team.   It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.

The following peripheral equipment items are embedded within the current mainframe operating environment and are not available on GSA Schedule.  The open market maintenance items listed below are embedded within the existing equipment infrastructure and are needed to successfully operate the mainframes:

Hardware Maintenance, Model Number, Quantity, Price
L700E, 690 SLOT, TAPE LIBRARY, CLU7000700-E70, 1, $597 
LTO GEN 2 DRIVE FOR L180/700, STK2001000-LT2, 6, $864

PKG CPTY 6.01-8.00, PKG2-T8, 1, $18,307 
 , , Total, $66,184 
Hardware maintenance is a necessary requirement to maintain complex technology systems.  The items are a essential components embedded within an overall mainframe environment that is purchased off GSA Schedule.  The Government is not able to isolate these items and purchase them separately, as it would cause undue burden and risk of disruption of required 24x7 operations.  Therefore it is in the Government?s best interest to incorporate the cost of the maintenance services in the total order.

<DESC>The Heavy Weight Deflectometer (HWD)is a pavement evaluation test equipment. This is a sole source equipment requirement and we intend to award to a sole source provider. The sole source provider is Dynatest Consulting Inc.
JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY:	Department of the Air Force
Air Education and Training Command
325th Contracting Squadron
Tyndall AFB, FL 32403-5526

2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  This is a request to award a firm-fixed price purchase order to DynatestConsulting Inc. Dynatest  Contractor is the sole vendor in the United States for Dynatest Heavy Weight Deflectometers (HWDs).  HWDs are used by the HQ Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency?s Airfield Pavement Evaluation (APE) Team to do airfield pavement evaluations at AF bases and forward operating locations around the world.  These systems allow us to collect data on the pavement and subsurface strength of soils to determine the load carrying capacity of airfield pavement.

3.  DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  The HWD is an air transportable system consisting of a trailer assembly that is pulled by a van that has upgraded electronics and power and well as a central processing/control unit installed.  This procurement is to provide a complete system; trailer and support van.   

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  FAR 6.302 ? Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: The HWD systems owned by AFCESA are the only three currently in the AF.  These are very specialized pieces of equipment, all manufactured by Dynatest for system compatibility.  Due to equipment operational familiarity, interchangeability of parts, maintenance, and the demanding training requirements for this one-of-a-kind type equipment, standardization of pavement testing equipment is essential.  The trailer portion of the HWD system is manufactured by Dynatest.  The original make/model of the support van is not critical, but the modifications and installed electronics necessary to ensure compatibility with the Dynatest trailer are.  A support van was procured in the past from another vendor.  Upon delivery, it proved to be not compatible, and required extensive modification by Dynatest to make it operational.     

6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  There are no other DoD approved or qualified sources for supply of these critical repair items.

7.  CONTRACTING OFFICER?S DETERMINATION THAT ANTICIPATED COSTS WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:  Estimated pricing is based on a review of similar item pricing and past procurement history.  The 325th Contracting Squadron will negotiate with Dynatest and utilize cost/price analysis techniques to ensure that the Air Force is getting pricing that is fair and reasonable and that the orders will result in the lowest overall cost to meet the Government?s needs.  

8.  MARKET SURVEY:  The technical representative attempted market research; however, none of the other pavement testing systems are compatible with current inventory Dynatest heavyweight deflectometer systems.  

9.  OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:  The APE Team is a high demand low density asset and the HWD plays a pivotal role in the team?s airfield pavement evaluations.  An HWD system was recently damaged beyond immediate repair in an accident while being surface-shipped to a test location.  There is an urgent and compelling need to procure this equipment to replace the damaged system, to meet the team?s evaluation schedule requirements and ensure the integrity of the data being acquired.

The relative order of importance of the evaluation factors is set forth in descending order of importance. Technical Features list will be compared to the requirements of the customer and shall be evaluated ?PASS? OR ?FAIL? (More important than price) Price The least important, but will become more important as technical and delivery are more closely aligned. Evaluation Criteria:
Technical Proposal:  Technical proposals submitted by each offeror will be evaluated Pass/Fail.  The Government will not give any favorable consideration, preference, ?extra credit,? or other positive evaluation to any matters contained in a section of the offeror?s proposal, which could be construed to exceed the minimum requirements.

Offeror must identify whether Brand Name or equal product will be used.  All equal products must be accompanied with manufacturer?s salient characteristics, brochures, and literature or other information that will enable a clear technical capability analysis.   No deficiencies and very few significant weaknesses noted.  Fail (F): The proposal or portion thereof, is unacceptable and clearly inadequate and fails to meet explicit and implicit RFQ requirements. The offeror fails to adequately demonstrate understanding of the requirements or to evidence a solid level of competence in the area.  Only through discussions and a revision to the proposal could the Technical Proposal be deemed acceptable. No reasonable chance of being selected for award as currently submitted.
Price Evaluation:   The offeror?s proposed price will be evaluation on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-3.  The evaluation may include, but not limited to: Price comparison with other offerors, Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and Comparison with Independent Government estimates.

Replace three HEPA filters per unit (six total), equivalent to Flanders Biological Grade HEPA filter model number 0-007-W-08-03-BU-12-00-GG-F
Certify filters immediately after installation as described below.*  Minor repair with 100% silicon acceptable, less than one square inch per filter.  Any leak greater than one square inch will require replacement of filter at contractor expense.6 units ? six (24?X24?X11.5?) HEPA filters per bankReplace six pre-filters per unit (36 total), 95% efficiency, 24?X24?X12?, metal frameReplace six HEPA filters per unit (36 total), equivalent to Flanders Biological Grade HEPA filter model number T-007-W-08-05-BU-52-00-GG-FU5Certify filters immediately after installation as described below.*  Minor repair with 100% silicon acceptable, less than one square inch per filter.  Any leak greater than one square inch will require replacement of filter at contractor expense.
*In Place HEPA Filter Testing. Field test and provide written certification of all HEPA filter units with Polyalphaolefin (PAO) after installation to verify that the filters do not contain pinhole leaks in the filter media, the bond between the filter media and the filter frame and the filter frame gasket to filter housing. Filter testing is intended to be completed in a similar manner to industry standards for certification of HEPA filters in Biological Safety Cabinets. Approved Testing Procedure:
        1)    Utilize an aerosol photometer with either a linear or a logarithmic scale and a threshold sensitivity of at least 1 x 10 -3 micrograms per liter for 0.3 micrometer diameter PAO particles and a capacity for measuring 80-120 micrograms per liter concentration. The air sampling rate shall be at least1 cfm. The photometer must be calibrated within the past calendar year. The PAO generator shall be the Laskin nozzle(s) type which generates an aerosol of PAO particles by flowing air through liquid PAO. The compressed air supply to the generator shall be adjusted to 20 psi, measured at the entrance to the nozzle and downstream of all restrictions. The nozzles shall be with liquid PAO to a depth not to exceed 1 inch.   2)    Adjust the air flow to approximately 10 percent of the design air flow rate of the filter. Place the PAO generator to uniformly introduce PAO aerosol upstream of the HEPA filter. Measure and record the upstream PAO concentration approximately in the center of the filter face.  For linear readout photometers (graduated 0_100), adjust the instrument to read 100 percent while using at least one Laskin type nozzle per 500 cfm airflow, or increments thereof. For logarithmic readout photometers, adjust the upstream concentration to 1 x 10-4 above the concentration necessary for one scale division (using the instrument calibration curve). 3)     With the nozzle of the photometer probe not more than 1 inch from the surface, scan the downstream side of the HEPA filters by passing the probe over the entire filter surface in slightly overlapping strokes. Scan the entire periphery of the filter, and the junctions between the filter media and the filter frame, and the filter frame and the housing. Scanning shall be done at a transverse rate of not more than 2 inches per second. 4)    Identify and repair all points of leakage which exceed 0.01 percent of PAO penetration at any point, measured by a linear or logarithmic photometer for acceptance.Initial performance verification testing of three BSL3 laboratoriesReview electronic readout of each BSL3 space and calculate air changes per hour.Confirm directional airflow at each door using smoke.
Compare each magnehelic gauge reading at each door against a calibrated differential pressure monitor.  Adjust magnehelic gauge as needed.
Compare each electronic pressure monitoring device against a calibrated differential pressure monitor.  Calibrate device as needed.
Test exhaust fan redundancy by disabling single exhaust fan.  System should maintain normal operations (pressure differentials).
Test supply/exhaust interlock by disabling all exhaust fans.  HVAC alarm should activate and two position dampers (if applicable) on shared supply system should close to prevent pressurization of BSL3 space, and air handler should shut down.  Upon restoration of exhaust, system should achieve and maintain normal operations.
Simulate control panel failure by cycling power to HVAC controls.  System should maintain normal operations.
Provide report for each failure scenario.  Report should include time of each event (fan failure, alarm activation, duration of positive pressurization of lab space, restoration of exhaust fan, time to normal operation status).
Provide report of deficiencies and any system adjustment recommendations.
Final performance verification testing of three BSL3 laboratories
Review changes that we made following initial testing.
Confirm directional airflow at each door using smoke.
Compare each magnehelic gauge reading at each door against a calibrated differential pressure monitor.  Adjust magnehelic gauge as needed.
Test exhaust fan redundancy by disabling single exhaust fan.  System should maintain normal operations (pressure differentials).
Test supply/exhaust interlock by disabling all exhaust fans.  HVAC alarm should activate and two position dampers on shared supply system (if applicable) should close to prevent pressurization of BSL3 space, and air handler should shut down.  Upon restoration of exhaust, system should achieve and maintain normal operations.
Simulate control panel failure by cycling power to HVAC controls.  System should maintain normal operations.  Work to be completed during normal working hours 8:00-1700  CST, contracts will be escorted at all times.  Work to be completed within 120 day ARO.
