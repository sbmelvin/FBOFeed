<a href="mailto:Frieda.Thornton@wpafb.af.mil;">Frieda.Thornton@wpafb.af.mil;</a>
<DESC>This announcement is an update to a synopsis originally posted on 12 December 2006 and revised synopsis posted on 19 March 2007, both referenced as solicitation number FA8625-07-R-6473.  The 716 Aeronautical Systems Group (716 AESG) (formerly ASC/GRA), awarded a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics (LMA) Marietta GA on 28 June 2007 for the procurement and manufacturing of the C-5 Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) Group A Hardware, kit assembly (which is the assembly of the  C-5 LAIRCM Group A hardware with the government furnished Group B components), C-5 LAIRCM Group A Spares, Interim Contractor Support (ICS) for Group A hardware, Installation of the C-5 LAIRCM Kit for Lot 1 only (Fiscal  Year (FY) 08), and associated over and above for legacy issues encountered d! uring kit installation.  As intended, the Government solicited and negotiated with only one responsible source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  This remains unchanged.  This requirement was not a set-aside for small business and is covered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334511, remains unchanged.  A production and installation (one lot only for installation) contract was awarded on 28 June 2007 for FY07 Group A Kit Procurement and FY07 Initial Group A Spares and included un-priced options for FY08 Kit Assembly, FY08 Group A Interim Contractor Support (ICS), FY08 Kit Installation and FY08 Rapid Repair and Response (over and above) for legacy issues encountered during kit installation.  This contract also contained un-priced options for FY08 through FY11 for Group A kit procurement, initial group A spares, ! kit assembly, and ICS for Group A components.  The C-5 LAIRCM Program is buy-to-budget and is currently dependent on the receipt of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding.  The lot profile is updated as follows:  8 Group A kits in Lot I (FY07); zero Group A kits in Lot II (FY08); 12 in Lot III (FY09); and from 1 to 8 each per FY for FY10 through FY16 for a maximum of 51 kits for all FYs (FY07 through FY16).  The 716 AESG intends to award a contract modification to Contract FA8625-07-C-6473 with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Marietta GA in July 2010 to continue performance of the C-5 LAIRCM Group A Kit procurement/assembly and spares..  The Group A kit procurement and assembly cost is estimated to increase from $24 million to $61 million.  As a result, there would be an overall increase in the estimated price for contract actions under this contract to increase from $34.4 million to $71.4 million.  The period of performance associated with this effort is 112 months which covers kits procurement and assembly beginning in FY07 and lasting th! rough FY16, for a maximum of 51 aircraft under the C-5 LAIRCM production effort.  The estimated value is derived using variable quantities from one to eight aircraft per year.  It is anticipated that the above increase will cover the estimated costs associated with 51 C-5 LAIRCM production kit procurement and assembly, which along with one previously approved as part of the C-5 LAIRCM System Development and Demonstration (SDD) program, allows for kit procurement and assemblies on all C-5 B/M model aircraft.  LMA is the developer of the C-5 LAIRCM Group A hardware and the development aircraft was delivered 31 January 2008.  In order for another source to manufacture the C-5 LAIRCM Group A hardware, that source would require knowledge of or access to LMA proprietary internal specifications and standards which the government does not have the rights to.  The LAIRCM system must integrate with all systems, subsystems, and components of the C-5 B/M model aircraft.  LAIRCM must be!  installed in the aircraft without any degradation of performance of the aircraft.  LMA, the original manufacturer of the C-5 aircraft, is the prime contractor for both the C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and C-5 Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP).  Both of these modernization programs must be considered in the design and fabrication of the Group A components and the integration of the Group A and Group B components into the resulting C-5 LAIRCM Kit.  The installation Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) which would be required by another potential source to bid on and accomplish the first C-5 LAIRCM installation was not available at the time of contract award on 28 June 2007 for the first Lot.  LMA through Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems under contract F09603-01-D-0207-0115 developed the initial Group A hardware and assembled and installed the Group A/B kit on the first aircraft, and delivered the necessary installation TCTO in March 2008, which was verified with the first production aircraft installation und! er Lot 1 (FY08) on 27 June 2008 which allows for the procurement for the installation only of the  C-5 LAIRCM Kit for future lots via competition.  Because the Government plans to issue a sole source solicitation to FA8625-07-R-6473, an additional synopsis will not be issued.  The approximate issue date of the solicitation will be 30 March 2010.  The approximate response date of the solicitation will be 31 May 2010.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>TITLE:  NNA04CI14T  SECTEK,  Inc.NASA/ARC has a requirement to extend the performance period of the ARC ProtectiveServices Contract for a maximum of ten months (April 1, 2010 - December 31, 2010); saidextension will consist of one two (2) month performance period and seven (7) one-monthoption periods, the exercise of each option being determined by the Government on amonthly basis. A contract modification reflecting this extension will be issued on orbefore March 31, 2010, which is the expiration date of the current protective servicescontract. NASA/ARC intends to extend the period of performance of contract NNA04CI14T, forprotective services which was awarded as a result of full and open competition under aGSA Schedule to SECTEK Inc., on June 1, 2004. This extension is necessary to bridge theperformance period between the end of the current contract and resolution of the currentprotest challenging NASAs agency-wide contract which was awarded on May 20, 2008 forProtection Services (i.e. Security guard services, potential fire/fighting/preventionservices, and potential emergency medical response services).Authorization of this extension has been issued by NASA Headquarters under PIC-09-04A,dated December 29, 2009 which provides a class deviation from the requirements of FAR17.204(e) and NFS 1817.204(e)(iii), limiting the terms of service contracts to five (5)years, including the basic contract and all options. This class deviation applies only toexisting contract requirements that will ultimately be provided under the agency-wideNASA Protective Services Contract (NPSC). NASA is using the authority for Other Than Full and Open Competition provided by 10U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Because SECTEK, Inc. possesses unique expertise in meeting thesecurity requirements of the Center, no alternate source could adequately provide for themaintenance of the Centers comprehensive security program during this extension period.  Award to another source when the agency-wide contract for protective services has beenrecently awarded, and while the resolution of the protest is nearing completion, wouldresult not only in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is notexpected to be recovered through competition, but also in unacceptable delays infulfilling the agency's requirement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government.Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 19, 2010. Suchcapabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determiningwhether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Oral communicationsare not acceptable in response to this notice. All questions MUST be in writing andshould be directed to Ms. Drake not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 19, 2010.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The plans will include photo documentation of existing walls to assist in reassembling the walls.  Also included in the project is repointing, pinning of rocks,minor drainage improvements, asphalt repair, and some shoulder slope stabilization.  The walls are adjacent to the parkway so traffic control is important.

This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; and permits discussions if necessary.  The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government.

<DESC>TAS::14 1041::TAS RECOVERY CHOH PMIS # 149742 Reconstruct and Stabilize Big Slackwater Historic Stone Wall and Towpath
This Project is an American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) action. Receipt of award is contingent upon the offeror's meeting the requirements of Section 1512 (reports of use of funds) of the Recovery Act.
General: The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is soliciting proposals for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described as follows: Reconstruct and Stabilize Big Slackwater Historic Stone Wall and Towpath at the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park near Williamsport, Maryland. Solicitation Number N2011100172. PMIS Number CHOH 149742. The offeror selected shall furnish all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of this project.
Description: The towpath was constructed on fill sections behind a masonry retaining wall or on an intermittent rock ledge at the base of a steep bluff. The historic stone masonry retaining wall that supports the towpath has been badly damaged by repeated floods and has not been repaired adequately since the canal ceased operations in 1924. Reconstruction will reestablish the towpath along a 4000-ft stretch of historic walls. An elevated walkway will be constructed along portions of the towpath adjacent to the rock bluffs.  In other areas, the historic wall will be stabilized and the towpath reconstructed. 
This project will require working from barges in the river and land-based staging areas. Work will be undertaken in segments to facilitate construction. Some of the work will require barge-mounted cranes to move material and place construction components including pre-cast concrete deck slabs on cast-in-place concrete piers. The river's depth at the towpath wall varies from 3 to 18 feet depending on seasonal fluctuations in the river's level. 
Type of Acquisition: A negotiated, firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability, subcontracting plan, past performance, and price to determine the best value (trade-off process) to the government.
The NAICS code for this project is 237310 and the small business size standard is $33.5 million. In accordance with FAR Subpart 36.204, the estimated price range for this contract is between $9,000,000 and $15,000,000. The contract duration is 500 calendar days following the notice to proceed.

<a href="mailto:mustard.anna@epa.gov">ANNA L. MUSTARD</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to award a contract for Statistical Support Services for Assessing Air Quality Data and Applications.  These services are required by the Atmospheric Modeling and Analysis Division (AMAD) within the U. S. EPA?s Office of Research and Development (ORD).  This acquisition is being offered as a Total Small Business Set Aside, with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of  541712.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard for NAICS code 541712 is 500 employees.
AMAD leads the development and evaluation of predictive atmospheric models for assessing changes in air quality and air pollutant exposures in support of EPA's mission to protect human health and the environment.  The models developed by AMAD are being used by EPA, NOAA, and the air pollution community in understanding and forecasting not only the magnitude of the air pollution problem but also in developing emission control policies and regulations for air quality improvements.  
AMAD also conducts research to link air quality modeling tools with human exposure and health outcomes. Exposure from ambient pollutants occurs at local (e.g., near-roadways) and regional scales (e.g., transported pollution).  Thus, this research provides analytical and physical modeling approaches that provide the spatial and temporal detail of concentration surfaces needed to understand the relationships among pollutants emitted, the resulting air quality, and exposure of humans to these pollutants. The contractor shall provide statistical support services in pursuit of these objectives in two major areas: (1) generating and improving air quality surfaces for use at various scales; and, (2) evaluating simulated products. 
Efforts required under this contract shall include the following:  improving air quality and related data through statistical approaches such as fusing air quality data and conducting quality assurance of air quality data; analyzing and characterizing air quality and related data through descriptive statistics and assessing temporal and spatial trends and relationships among emissions, ambient concentrations, exposure and health outcomes; and, developing and applying statistical techniques to evaluate models and tools.  Award of an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated.  The resulting contract is expected to have a base year and four one-year option periods.  
The Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued approximately 15 days after the date of publication of this notice, with proposals due approximately thirty (30) days after release of the RFP/solicitation.  The RFP will be available solely through the EPA?s website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments (if any), will also be distributed solely through the EPA?s web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  All prospective offerors must be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) site at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: POLISHED CONCRETE FLOORS IN THE NEW U.S. COURTHOUSE IN EL PASO, TX. POC Lisa B. Byrd, Contracting Officer, Telephone # 817/978-2714; fax # 817/978-2577; e-mail address lisa.byrd@gsa.gov SOLICITATION NO. GS-07P-10-HH-C-0020 (SOURCES SOUGHT WAS LISTED UNDER GS-07P-10-HHC-XXXX) <br />The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for qualified contractors to compete in the procurement process to provide the labor and materials to hone/grind and polish the existing exposed concrete floors in the public areas of the new U.S. Courthouse in El Paso, TX. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 238110. The size standard is $14 million per year. THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN, UNRESTRICTED procurement. Procurement is made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is scheduled to be issued on or about February 26, 2010. Interested firms will be required to provide their Dun &amp; Bradsteet (DUNS) number in order to receive a copy of the solicitation documents. Interested firms must also be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (ccr) database. All requests for the RFP must be made directly to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at lisa.byrd@gsa.gov The Pre-Proposal Conference is scheduled for March 11, 2010 at 11:30a.m. MST. The location is the Federal Building located at 700 E. San Antonio Street in El Paso, TX. A site visit will be offered after the Conference.<br /><br />The process is intended to result in a "honed" finish where the aggregate is exposed and the polish is integral to the finish. The intent is a finish where "wet mopping" would be the primary maintenance required. The level of exposure of aggregate will be determined in the mock-up process. The estimated square footage of floor to be "honed/polished" is 27,000 square feet.&nbsp; This includes a 2-level public lobby and six (6) repetitive floors of public circulation from the elevators to the courtrooms. The majority of the floors to be honed are a light weight aggregate concrete mix on metal deck. There are areas of concrete adjacent to the light weight mix floors - such as the elevator thresholds - that are regular mix concrete and will also need to be finished. <br />An additional area of work will be a transition zone of approximately 50 square feet of topping slab, used to correct a floor level discrepancy.&nbsp; Interested parties submitting a proposal in response to this announcement must provide documentation confirming they have performed floor finishing operations similar to the process described above and in the solicitation documents in buildings with a minimum of 10,000 square feet treated surface area. Such documentation should include the building name, location, square footage treated, photographs of finished floors and contact information for references the Government may contact for past performance information. The GSA may visit selected sites as part of the contractor evaluation procedure. The appearance and durability of the concrete floors listed will be a selection criteria.&nbsp; The scope of this project may require the chosen contractor to perform the work after normal business hours and on weekends. However, the plan is to have the chosen contractor work during normal business hours during the week. The building will be unoccupied. Acceptance of the finished floors will be subject to the inspection of the floor areas by Government inspectors. <br />Anticipated start date is on or about April 27, 2010. Performance period is 21 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed (NTP) date.&nbsp; The contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures. The Government anticipates the award of a Firm, Fixed-Price contract based on a final negotiated or accepted price, to the contractor that offers the best overall value to the Government. The technical factors for evaluation are: 1) Past Performance and Experience of the Firm on Similar Projects and 2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel on Similar Projects. Definition of "Similar Projects" is the installation of a polished concrete floor system for interior concrete floors (minimum of 10,000 square feet) by dry grinding and polishing with various size grit metal-bonded and resin-bonded diamonds and application of concrete densifier. All questions/clarifications regarding the RFP shall be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than 12:00 noon (CST) on March 22, 2010. Proposals will be due by 3:30p.m. CST on March 29, 2010 to the following address: General Services Administration, Attn: Lisa B. Byrd (7PQA), 819 Taylor Street (Room 12A), Fort Worth, TX 76102-6105 All correspondence in response to this announcement must indicate the Solicitation Number GS-07P-10-HH-C-0020. All interested large firms are reminded the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practical extent possible with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business and women-owned small business concerns, as indicated in FAR 19.702. <br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <br />

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION:<BR> a. General: This proposed contract is for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Construction phase Services (CPS) which will be procured in accordance with PL-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and implemented in FAR Part 36.6. <BR><BR>The proposed A-E contract will provide staffing to support the construction activities in the San Antonio Area Office area located  in San Antonio, TX and could include CPS for various military and some Civil Works projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwestern Division (SWD) regional boundaries (TX, LA, NM, AR, OK) to allow the flexibility of sharing capacity with other Corps Districts (outside SWD boundaries) and other Federal agencies in unique cases. This flexibility would only be exercised in unique cases (anticipate less than 10%). North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<BR><BR>This announcement is open only to 8(a) SMALL BUSINESSES.   The prime A-E firm must perform 50% or more of the work on this contract.   Anticipated contract award will be on or about May, 2010.  One Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be awarded from this announcement for a cumulative amount of $6,000,000 with a minimum guarantee amount of $5,000.00 only for the base period.  There will be a base period of 2 years with one 3 year option.  <BR><BR>Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.601-4(b).<BR><BR>Price will not be used as a criterion for selection. <BR><BR>There will be NO design services included in this contract.<BR><BR>Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest. The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONLICTS OF INTEREST. An organizational conflict of interest<BR>can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement. When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award. Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required. And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract. However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors.<BR><BR>b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect-Engineer (A-E) shall furnish all personnel, services, materials, supplies and supervision required to fully complete each task order.   Personnel provided by this contract will operate out of Government supplied facilities.<BR><BR><BR>c. Contract Award Procedure: <BR>The proposed services will be obtained by Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov .<BR><BR>2.

The construction work will require a significant amount of coordination amongst neighboring building project teams and City agencies.<BR><BR>Specifically, an existing asphalt/concrete parking lot will be replaced; existing lagging and pile walls and an intricate web of existing underground utilities as well as a network of abandoned piles will be worked into upper and lower level park spaces. The two park spaces will be connected by way of stairways and an elevator. A grid of auger cast piles has already been constructed. The piles will support a park building housing a fountain equipment room; an area of which is dedicated to public restrooms and other future uses. The building's MEP system includes a geothermal well field and other specialized equipment. Above the building's insulated and waterproofed roof sits the upper level plaza and includes a customized elevator with glass doors,  a computer programmable interactive water feature, a custom fabricated steel pergola with structural glass paving and three structural glass paved balconies sporting a computer programmable water curtain cascading into a basin below, site furnishings/lighting, and tree planting areas utilizing an engineered structural soil matrix. Granite pavers cover the remaining area. A stairway descends 18 feet and is centered between water cascades both to the east and the west, each including programmable features. The lower level park plaza includes 10' to 40' wide stairways and a 60' long sloped walk connecting the park to the neighboring public roadway. A loggia directly below the pergola provides protected access to the fountain equipment building and public restrooms. Ten foot to 50' long x 1' wide water basins include computer programmable features. Solid and clad stone walls, site furnishings/lighting, an irrigated tree planting area, and granite pavers as well as concrete paving are also included in the construction.   <BR><BR>This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement.

<DESC>In compliance with the trancparancy and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery an Reinvestment Act of 2008 (the "Act"), Public Law 111.5, this notice is issued for market research purposes. The USGS has a requirement for replacement feedback electronics (FBE) assemblies for use with the existing Streckeisen STS-1 seismometers operated in the Global Seismographic Netwirk (GSN). These assemblies will be used to upgrade existing seismic stations. These assemblies must be existing, updated or improved versions of models which can be purchased "off the shelf" and of the type or types that have been utilized in previous deployments for periods of not less than six (6) months. Based on the information available at this time, and in accordance with 41USC 253.(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as sole source from Kinemetrics, the incumbent contractor, and proposes to negotiate a modification with that firm on that basis. However should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel they can provide the required units within the criteria specified herein are requested to give written notification (including telephone number for a point of contact ) to the proceeding office within three (3) working days from the date of this announcement. An affirmative response must include sufficient information to determine that the company has the requisite experience to perform. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered nonresponsive without further consideration. The government anticipates award of sole source, firm fixed modification. Full or partial fundings to be completed by the contractor will utilize funds provided by the Act. Inclusions of unique provisions required to implement the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparancy requirements are required. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement. (ATN ARRA-SE0002F.1, TAS 14 0803)

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs is seeking sources to provide Advisory & Assistance Services to implementation Patient-Centered Care initiative. This is not a solicitation announcement.  The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge and information for the purposes of market research.  Information gained by this SSN may or may not result in a subsequent solicitation. A response to this SSN is not a request to be added to a prospective bidders list or to automatically receive a copy of future solicitations.  Parties that do not provide a response to this SSN will not be restricted from proposing on any future solicitation if and when a solicitation is made available for these services.         Title of Proposed Project:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Implementation of Patient-Centered CareBackground:  The best healthcare delivery systems in the nation are now implementing "patient-centered" care. This relatively new concept requires that healthcare providers and institutions completely reevaluate how they deliver care. They then implement new processes where care is totally focused on patient needs and desires, as opposed to the traditional methods of care delivery which are more focused on healthcare providers and the needs of the system of care delivery itself. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides the national healthcare system for United States' Veterans. These services are provided by 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), administering 154 full-service hospitals, psychiatric facilities, community living centers, Veteran centers, research facilities, rehabilitation facilities and 675 Community-Based Outpatient Clinics.   Comprehensive health care is provided through primary, tertiary, and long-term care in the areas of medicine, surgery, psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, neurology, oncology, dentistry, geriatrics, spinal cord injury, women's health and extended care.VA is a "learning organization" that continuously strives to improve patient care, patient satisfaction, patient education as well as employee morale and satisfaction throughout all its divisions and programs. Building upon its strength of providing "the best care anywhere," VA now wishes to embark on a major cultural transformation to Patient-Centered Care.  Assistance with this massive transformation is the specific focus of this consulting contract. The anticipated result of the cultural transformation will include national recognition for the VA Healthcare System as a patient-centered health care environment. It has been well demonstrated that where such patient-centered cultures exist, patient outcomes and patient satisfaction increases dramatically.  In these environments, staff satisfaction is also enhanced, resulting in highly significant improvements in staff recruitment and retention. Additionally, the overall organization is able to function more effectively and efficiently and operational costs are dramatically reduced. Proposed Scope of Work:  VHA wishes to enter into a contractual agreement with an organization with a proven track record in implementing Patient-Centered Care and who is widely known for its expertise in such implementation. The contractor would be expected to provide all resources necessary to accomplish specified goals with proven measurable results over a period of performance not to exceeding three years.  The winning contractor will be expected  provide consultation in helping VA embark on its major cultural transformation to Patient-Centered Care, providing experts who are available to assist in a number of ways including: direct, on-site consultation and guidance; education and training for staff; oversight of the cultural transformation process; ongoing advice and consultation to leaders at all levels; conducting readiness assessments to determine the readiness of individual VA facilities for undertaking implementation and ongoing organizational assessment to determine the progress of the implementation.  Type of Contract Contemplated:  Multi Year Firm-Fixed-PriceSubmittal Information:Respondents shall provide in a general capabilities statement to address the following information: 1.	A short narrative on how your firm would approach a project of this scope detailing at a minimum the level of effort that would be provide, the location of were those efforts would be performed, the resources that would be utilized, the tangible and intangible deliverables that would be provided, and the organization structure that would be employed.  2.

Please identify whether you performed as a prime contractor, sub-contractor, teaming partner, or as a project manager.  Please be specific and provide a complete reference to include at a minimum the project name, contract award amount, time to complete project, and the project owners' contact information. 3.

Respondents are highly encouraged to provide suggestions and comments on the above project.  Suggestions and comments should be included in a separate section and be phrased in a manner to help the government better understand the commercial practices of these services and industry which provides them.   It is requested that interested parties submit a response (electronic submission) that addresses the above information. Please also include a cover page which includes, at a minimum, the company's name, address, Dunn & Bradstreet number, GSA contract number, socio-economic status, point-of-contact name, phone number, RFQ number, and e-mail address.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Lyris Technologies Inc. for Lyris List Server Rebranding and Comprehensive Support (phone/email/upgrades) for Lyris List Manager Extreme at 200 3rd Street, Parkersburg, WV. The Government intends to make an award for a base period and 4 option periods.
<p>A sole source to Lyris Technologies Inc. is intended for this order. Lyris List Server Rebranding is an add-on to software (Lyris List Manager Extreme) already in use since FY2009. The rebranding for this software can only be obtained from Lyris. It is the proprietary and confidential property of Lyris Technologies Inc. This rebranding enables BPD to change the lyris@address by removing lyris and any distinguishing marks of the Lyris List Manager. Instead it will bear all the brand name marks that will be provided by and most advantageous to BPD.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Lyris Technologies Inc. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

TAS: 14  19027086
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of other than Full and Open competition Under $25,000
1) The Conservation Genetics Laboratory needs to order four Qiagen DNeasy 96 Blood & Tissue Kit (12) for DNA extraction.  
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition.  Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title.  
FAR 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This means that the supplies or services can only be obtained from one firm usually due to their unique technical expertise.  Basically, there is no other source that can provide this supply or service.
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). 
DNA extraction is the first and most important stage of producing the highest quality genetic information to meet the Conservation Genetics Laboratory's (CGL) mission and obligations.  Currently the CGL uses the DNeasy 96 Tissue Kits for DNA extraction.  These kits are provided by Qiagen, Inc. and allow for DNA extraction to be accomplished in a standardized 96 well format.  Being able to extract DNA in the 96 well format is imperative to maintain the required work flow of the CGL.	Qiagen, Inc, has proprietary rights to the DNeasy kits and the associated consumables.  The DNeasy kits have been in use at the CGL for more than 7 years due to the success of these products in all laboratory protocols.  Currently all laboratory protocols, chemicals, and laboratory instrumentation are designed to work with this method of DNA extraction.  A change in vendor would require weeks of down-time to allow for re-optimization of all laboratory protocols.  The amount of down-time required to re-optimize the CGL's PCR conditions alone would cost close to $100,000.00, based on previous experience when the laboratory had to change chemistries.  In addition to PCR re-optimization, the laboratory's liquid handling automation would also need to be re-optimized resulting in loss of time and potentially the need to pay for additional service and programming support from the automation vendors.  Because of variations in equipment needed and in DNA quality and quantity produced from vendor to vendor we are requesting this sole source for DNA extraction kits supplied by Qiagen. 
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical.  
The CGL has previously used other DNA extraction methods and found that the quality and quantity were insufficient for current protocols, that the method was not efficient, or the resulting DNA was not archiveable.  Many extraction kits are designed for use with plant tissues, blood samples, or mouse tails.  The CGL primarily extracts DNA from fish fin tissue that is highly cartilaginous.  This tissue can be very hard and difficult to breakdown in the initial steps of extraction. 
Prior to the use of Qiagen DNeasy kits the CGL used PureGene DNA extraction kits provided by Gentra.  These kits do not use a 96 well format for extraction.  This method is no longer efficient based on the amount of samples the CGL is processing.  Based on the throughput required for any kit not using a 96 well format will be in-efficient and could lead to increased human errors.
The CGL has also used Chelex from Sigma as a DNA extraction method.  This method does not produce DNA of sufficient quantity or quality to meet CGL standards.  The resulting DNA from this method is no longer useable after 6 months and therefore is not archiveable.  
Many kits on the market today use beads to mechanically lyse the tissue to be extracted.  This method was tested in the CGL using a Qiagen TissueLyser and the provided beads.  This method failed to lyse the test tissue at all.  Any method using similar technology is not likely to work.		5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. 
The CGL is routinely visited and contacted by industry representatives.  To date no other method discussed has appeared to be an equivalent replacement for the DNeasy kits.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">This technology addresses two important technical problems associated with Special Nuclear Material (SNM) detection. The first is that SNM detectors are generally sensitive to cosmogenic and ambient background gamma-rays and neutrons in addition to any potential real SNM source. This has the effect of reducing the sensitivity to real SNM. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Real SNM tends to emit small numbers of neutrons simultaneously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since background sources of simultaneous neutrons are relatively rare, high multiplicity neutron events become a key signature for the presence of SNM.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">The second problem is ease of operation in the field--environmental and physical safety. Currently, few options satisfy all these requirements. Presently, most detectors require materials that are either expensive, hazardous or need to be operated at cryogenic temperatures. Plastic scintillator detectors have recently been employed to overcome safety issues and enable large detectors. However, plastic scintillators are expensive to approach </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">4</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">&pi; coverage of a cargo container; hence are unlikely to be sensitive to neutron multiplicity.</span></p>

LLNL's detector is equipped with fast timing capability so that the time correlations between seccessive events can be measured.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS<br /></span><br /></strong>The purpose of this Modification 27 is to obligate $600,000 in new funding and transfer from Option Period 1 $238,047.17 to Option Period 2 in support of Work Assignment (WA 2-101; WA 2-102; and WA 2-103). The period of performance for Work Assignment 1-101 will be from May 11, 2009 through December 31, 2009. Funding for WA 1-101 is changed to $775.952.83. The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-101 and WA 2-102 will be from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-101 is $238,047.17. Funding for WA 2-102 is $200,000. The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-103 will be from January 4, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-103 is $400,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-101, requires support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br />&bull; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA. <br />&bull; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.<br />&bull; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&bull; Prepare a report on each waiver. <br />&bull; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-102, the contractor shall provide the technical and logistical assistance to support the EPA in achieving the goal, objectives and requirements of the ARRA provisions as to "Green Infrastructure." Efforts will revolve around the review of DWSRF project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding to determine whether those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices that can be incorporated into the projects. The effort will include providing technical assistance to states and applicants in developing and reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The primary focus is on the green aspects of drinking water infrastructure projects. The work is intended to supplement and be coordinated with EPA's efforts for the GPR through the CWSRF.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This work assignment will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under ARRA's Green Project Reserve (GPR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under WA 2-103, the contractor shall provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.<br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

ITEM DESCRIPTION:<BR><BR>a)  INTENDED USE:  <BR><BR>The Live Fire Shoot House is intended to be used to develop close quarter tactics, techniques, and procedures in day/night conditions.  It must be portable and modular and have an overhead catwalk for instructor observation.  Ease of assembly, layout modification, disassembly, and lead clean up procedures are critical elements of the system.  <BR><BR>b)  SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:  <BR><BR>Dimensions and Modular Properties  Live Fire Shoot House shall be 26 foot by 30 foot with a capability for future expansion without modification of the initial purchase.  The shoot house shall be able to function as a single large room and allow insertion of additional panels to create up to 4 rooms and a hallway within the 26 X 30 room.  The insertion of additional panels shall not require disassembly of previously erected panels.      <BR><BR>Ballistic Panels  All panels shall be manufactured with a minimum 3/8 inch thick steel with a Brinell Hardness Rating of 550 (AR550 Steel).  The contractor shall provide documentation from the steel manufacturer certifying the Brinell rating of the steel.  Panel system shall be capable of supporting explosive entry on doorways with charges possessing a net explosive weight of two (2) ounces.  Cladding for the ballistic panels shall consist of an outer layer that provides a self sealing surface to limit the escape of bullet splatter.  An air gap shall exist between the outer layer and the panel which allows bullets to strike the panel and fall to a collection area.  Cladding shall be attached to individual panels and able to be replaced without disassembly of the wall in which the panel is installed. Ballistic panels and their cladding shall be designed to provide access to lead debris without disassembly or lifting of individual panels.  Door openings and window openings shall be built as individual panels that can be relocated within in the shoot house.  The contractor shall purchase and deliver eight (8) door panels, and six (6) window panels. The contractor shall purchase and deliver six (6) spare ballistic panels that can be utilized to swap out panels that require extensive repair.  The panel swap shall be accomplished without major disassembly of walls.<BR><BR>Overhead Catwalk  The 26X30 live fire shoot house shall have a catwalk system that can support six (6) personnel weighing 200 pounds each.  Access to the catwalk shall be from stairs or ladder.  The access point and the catwalk shall have fall protection.  The design of the catwalk shall provide overhead viewing of the entire interior area of the shoot house.  The contractor shall note in its proposal what type of catwalk design they are proposing.  If the contractor proposes a moveable catwalk, they shall note the time required to relocate the catwalk in their proposal.<BR><BR>Assembly and Disassembly  The Government will utilize its warehouse in the immediate vicinity of the Multi-Story Trainer to store the shoot house panels when they are not in use.  The shoot house shall be capable of being assembled on a smooth surface without the installation of additional floor tiles.  Strips of material necessary to support wall placement are acceptable as long as they do not require attachment to the floor with fasteners.<BR><BR>Technical Testing - The Government will test all panels/AR Steel with a Brinell Hardness Tester to verify all AR steel has a minimum hardness of 500 on the Brinell Scale.<BR>

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

		(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agencys network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk  regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPMs IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.
 
	(f)	Points of Contact

1752.224-71	Freedom of Information Act Requests (Sep 2009)

	(a)	Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Therefore:

		(1)	All items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked in all documents submitted to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or The Government).  Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the OPM determines disclosure is warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.

		(2)	No later than five (5) business days after award of a contract, blanket purchase agreement (BPA), or order, the Contractor must provide OPM a redacted copy of the contract/BPA/order in electronic format. This copy will be used to satisfy any requests for copies of the contract/BPA/order under the FOIA. If the Contracting Officer believes that any redacted information does not require protection from public release, the issue will be resolved in accordance with paragraph 3.104-4(d) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

	(b)	Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.

	(c)	In performance of this contract, the Contractor assumes responsibility for protection of the confidentiality of Government records and must ensure that all work performed by its subcontractors shall be under the supervision of the Contractor or the Contractor's responsible employees.

	(d)	Each officer or employee of the Contractor or any of its subcontractors to whom any Government record may be made available or disclosed must be notified in writing by the Contractor that information disclosed to such officer or employee can be used only for a purpose and to the extent authorized herein, and that further disclosure of any such information, by any means, for a purpose or to an extent unauthorized herein, may subject the offender to criminal sanctions imposed by 19 U.S.C. 641.

The incumbent will be the primary advisor to a number of projects in the USAID West Bank &amp; Gaza Mission.

<p>The USAID Mission for the West Bank and Gaza manages the overall U.S. assistance program to the Palestinians.

It is implemented against the backdrop of ongoing conflict and negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel. The USAID program is intended to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza; promote a competitive market economy; foster the effective use of scarce resources; promote the development of a democratic society; encourage sound public management and provide emergency or humanitarian assistance when needed. The program has obligated $2.9 billion since 1994 on the WBG development program. In per capita terms, this is one of the largest USAID programs in the world.</p>

PROJECT INFORMATION:<BR><BR>This contract will provide architect and engineering services primarily for flood risk management efforts for the Mamaroneck/Sheldrake Flood Risk Management General Re-evaluation Report (GRR). At a minimum, the potential flood damage reduction measures that may be examined in the reevaluation report include channel modification, levees, floodwalls, diversion, as well as non-structural measures and the no action alternative. Solutions may include, but will not be limited to: variations of the recommended plans components i.e. channel work, diversion tunnel, levees and floodwalls.  Non-structural measures such as buyouts and preservation and/or creation of open space in the floodplain will also be reconsidered in light of changes to existing conditions and changes to environmental policy.<BR><BR>Ultimately, the final GRR will detail the optimal plan for flood risk management in the Mamaroneck and Sheldrake Rivers Basin. The reevaluation report will serve to document the re-evaluation of the recommended plan, (including any adjustments or variations of said plan) and provide a basis for a decision on construction authorization of the project (if needed) and serve as the decision document for signature of a Project Partnership Agreement.<BR>  <BR>This work is within the New York District boundaries.

Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation.

Vendors that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for validity of quotations. The vendor agrees to establish a firm timeframe in which the proposed price is good for.<br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of quotations. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.<br />(e) Multiple quotations. Vendors are encouraged to submit multiple quotations presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each quotation submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. (This section is reserved for Request for Proposals using FAR Part 15 except as described by (f)(6) of this section) <br />(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or<br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.<br />(6) In accordance with FAR 13.004, the following information regarding quotations is provided:<br />Legal Effect of Quotations<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. <br />(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate quotations as described in FAR 13.106-2 on a Best Value basis considering price and technical acceptability. Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government may accept other than the lowest quote; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotes received. <br />(h) Multiple awards. (To be used at the Contracting Officers discrestion) The Government may accept any item or group of items of a quote, unless the vendor qualifies the quote by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, quotes may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity quoted, at the unit prices quoted, unless the vendor specifies otherwise in the quote.<br />(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.<br />(1)(i) The GSA Index of Federal Specifications, Standards and Commercial Item Descriptions, FPMR Part 101-29, and copies of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained for a fee by submitting a request to--<br />GSA Federal Supply Service Specifications Section<br />Suite 8100<br />470 L'Enfant Plaza, SW<br />Washington, DC 20407<br />Telephone (202) 619-8925)<br />Facsimile (202 619-8978)<br />(ii) If the General Services Administration, Department of Agriculture, or Department of Veterans Affairs issued this solicitation, a single copy of specifications, standards, and commercial item descriptions cited in this solicitation may be obtained free of charge by submitting a request to the addressee in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this provision. Additional copies will be issued for a fee.<br />(2) Most unclassified Defense specifications and standards may be downloaded from the following ASSIST websites:<br />(i) ASSIST (http://assist.daps.dla.mil).<br />(ii) Quick Search (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch).<br />(iii) ASSISTdocs.com (http://assistdocs.com).<br />(3) Documents not available from ASSIST may be ordered from the Department of Defense Single Stock Point (DoDSSP) by--<br />(i) Using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard (http://assist.daps.dla.mil/wizard);<br />(ii) Phoning the DoDSSP Customer Service Desk (215) 697-2179, Mon-Fri, 0730 to 1600 EST; or<br />(iii) Ordering from DoDSSP, Building 4, Section D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5094, Telephone (215) 697-2667/2179, Facsimile (215) 697-1462.<br />(4) Nongovernment (voluntary) standards must be obtained from the organization responsible for their preparation, publication or maintenance.<br />(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all quotations exceeding $3,000, and quotations of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The vendor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its quotation, the annotation ``DUNS'' or ``DUNS +4'' followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the vendor's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the vendor to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the vendor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An vendor within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An vendor located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The vendor should indicate that it is a vendor for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.<br />(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the vendor does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered vendor. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) is seeking interested contractors to provide Contractor Logistics Support services for a Maintenance Data Collection (MDC) system in support of Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) SAP/SAR programs. This contract&nbsp;is <strong>scheduled to&nbsp;begin in summer&nbsp;</strong> 2010 and will have a 1-year period of performance (PoP) with four 1-year options. The available funding profile is ~830k per year in 3400 funding only. The Government intends to award a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contract using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) solicitation approach. SYSW currently uses the Logistics Information Operations and Network System (LIONS) to perform MDC for its Space Control SAP/SAR programs. The current contractor providing these services to SYSW is Dynamic Research Corporation.
<p>SYSW desires to contract for the data management and sustainment of an existing, TO 00-20-2 compliant, web-based Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) MDC system that is accredited to receive and manage maintenance data collected from operational SYSW systems through the Air Force Secure Global Network (SGN) platform. Specifically, the contractor, and their offered solution, must perform the following technical requirements: provide data/reports and populate forms regarding equipment management and tracking; equipment status reporting; configuration status; stock control reporting; preventative maintenance inspection tracking; unique identifier (UID) tracking; user access administration and help desk support. Contractors must, at the time of contract award, have an established Air Force SGN Node and be capable of operating their SGN accredited solution on the AF SGN platform.

<p>The contractor may either propose to sustain LIONS (the LIONS User Guide and a software requirements document will be provided as Government furnished information (GFI) in the solicitation package) or propose their own DCID 6/3 accredited MDC solution that: 1) meets the security requirements required to support SYSW SAP/SAR systems, 2) meets the technical capabilities as stated above, 3) meets the schedule requirements of the Government to ensure support is available to the operational user (see following paragraph), and 4) fits within the Government's established funding profile.</p>
<p>To minimize operational impacts, the contractor must be ready with-in 1-week of contract award to provide training to the operational users, provide access to their proposed MDC solution at the SYSW operational and contractor sites (i.e. California, New Mexico, Colorado and Florida), and load Government provided maintenance data into their proposed MDC solution. In addition to meeting the aforementioned technical requirements, the contractor must be able to perform the following scope of tasks IAW the Performance Work Statement:</p>
<p>1. Depot and Sustaining Engineering (D&amp;SE): D&amp;SE is defined as the delivery of sustainment/CLS services in support of the proposed MDC solution. The contractor shall maintain a sustaining engineering capability; a depot repair and test capability; perform spares repair and testing; perform integration and test; perform system interface control; perform emergency site repairs and support System Problem Requests (SPR) resolution.</p>
<p>2. Network and Data Administration: The contractor shall maintain the MDC's web-based network database management system to include server maintenance and the assignment of user accounts and privileges.</p>
<p>3. Support to Field Operations: The contractor shall provide technical advice and assistance from the contractor facility, as required, via a help desk. At the direction of the Government, the contractor shall provide fly-away sustainment support when necessary.</p>
<p>4. Training: The contractor shall conduct training for operational users, site maintenance, and site system administration. Training shall include a User's Guide along with classroom instruction.</p>
<p>5. Studies and Analyses: The contractor shall conduct analyses to reduce life cycle costs, replace obsolete/unsupportable equipment and evaluate the feasibility of potential capability enhancements and/or system changes.</p>
<p>6. Upgrades: The contractor shall perform upgrades, to include pre-planned product improvements (P3I), to enhance system capabilities (i.e. to migrate the proposed MDC solution onto SIPRNET) and/or promote life-cycle cost savings. This includes updating/upgrading associated technical documentation, training, system hardware, system software, etc.</p>
<p>7. Installation: At the direction of the Government, the contractor shall install, configure and test workstations and software at both the user and contractor locations in support of newly developed SYSW systems requiring a MDC capability.</p>
<p>8. Security Support: The contractor shall establish and apply a process for adhering to the contract DD254 to include controlling classified document control, managing personnel security (billets, clearance processing), SCIF operations, Communications Security (COMSEC), Automated Information Systems (AIS) security, program security, Operational Security (OPSEC) and other required security tasks</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME<BR><BR><BR>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Armys LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<BR><BR>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<BR><BR>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Armys LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<BR><BR>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<BR><BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Armys Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <BR><BR>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<BR>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Armys current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to Additional Info located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents.                                                                                                                       <BR>Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm <BR><BR>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <BR><BR>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Armys LNA Compliance requirements. <BR><BR>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendors assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendors certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<BR><BR>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<BR><BR>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<BR><BR>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <BR><BR><BR>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<BR>

If the Contracting Officer isn't available, please contact the Team Leader, Vivian S. Hubbs at Vhubbs@cdc.gov.</strong></p>
<p>The contractor shall conduct interviewing, data processing, and data file documentation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Interviewing shall be conducted from mid-2011 to mid-2019, based upon approximately 5,000 completed interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age in the household population of the United States. In summary, the contractor shall perform the following tasks, working in close, continuing collaboration with the NCHS/NSFG staff:</p>
<p>(1) design a national sample that will yield about 5,000 interviews per year with men <br />and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews), with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age; <br />(2) program and test questionnaires for males and females; <br />(3) prepare advance letters, consent forms, and other survey field materials; <br />(4) recruit, hire, and train interviewers;<br />(5) conduct all interviews in person, typically in respondents' homes, collecting signed consent for the interview for all respondents, and signed parental consent for interviews with 15-17 year olds;<br />(6) achieve a 75% weighted response rate for both men and women;<br />(7) Use laptop computers to conduct the interviews, and send the (encrypted) data electronically to the contractor's central office as promptly as possible; <br />(8) Prepare 3 public use data files based on every 2-3 years of interviewing <br />(a public use file must be based on at least 12,000 interviews);<br />(9) Prepare Series 1 ("Plan and Operation") and Series 2 ("Sample Design, weighting, imputation, &amp; variance estimation") reports to describe the work that was done.<br />(10) Keep the data safe, secure, and confidential.</p>
<p>Thus, this contract will require the collection of a wide range of complex and sensitive data, in person, in English and Spanish, from national samples. The data must measure trends &amp; differences among the total population &amp; important sub-groups, with a response rate that gives its users confidence in the results, and at a cost that NCHS can afford. The contractor must also meet requirements for Certification and Accreditation for IT security under FISMA and other applicable laws.</p>
<p>Further information on the survey is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.<br />Offerors are expected to be familiar with the contents of the web site and with Series 1, No. 48 ("Planning and Development of the continuous National Survey of Family Growth" and Series 2, No. 142 ("National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 6: Sample Design, Weighting, Imputation, and Variance Estimation.")

<p>Q-Bank (a product of an interagency collaboration and hosted by NCHS), is a database consisting of evaluated questions from Federal surveys and links each question to the scientific report that evaluated the survey question. Questions are searchable by survey title, question topic (e.g. income, demographic, chronic health conditions), information type (e.g. objective characteristics, behavioral reports, attitudes), response category (e.g. yes/no, open-ended, quantity), response error (e.g. problems with terms, recall problems). In addition, users can search for keywords within individual questions. Q-Bank is intended to help users of survey data interpret the survey questions on which the data are based and understand the potential errors that might be associated with these questions. A steering committee of representatives from various agencies directs the future and development of the database.</p>

<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has three facilities located at Boulder, Colorado; Wellington, Colorado; and Kauai, Hawaii. These locations consist of approximately 30 separate buildings totaling approximately 650,000 square feet, which consist of scientific research laboratories and clean rooms, warehouses, machine shops, maintenance, shops, a central utility plant, administrative offices, and conference/auditorium facilities, along with radio transmission sites. The age of the facilities range from the late 1950's to present day state of the art technology and construction.
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking a qualified firm to provide Architect-Engineer Services with emphasis on a firm that has complete architectural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, security systems, and civil engineering capability.</p>
<p>The Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Task Order Contract will have a twelve (12) month base period of performance with renewal options for four (4) additional twelve (12) month periods.</p>
<p>**A firm-fixed price will be negotiated for each task order. The contract will have a $5,000.00 minimum and a $5,000,000.00 maximum over the life of the contract.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330. The Size Standard is $4.5 million in annual receipts (average annual gross revenue for the last three (3) fiscal years).</p>
<p>Projects include the evaluation, renovation, modification, replacement, and upgrading of buildings, structures, and services. Work may include the following disciplines: architecture, landscape architecture, field investigation, civil structural, mechanical, electrical, fire protection, security systems, construction management, inspections (quality assurance and control), geotechnical engineering, materials testing/evaluation, surveying and document preparation. Document preparation includes engineering feasibility studies, conceptual designs and reports, contract drawings and specifications, design calculations, cost estimates, master planning, and project schedules. Specialized qualifications include experience in the evaluation and refurbishment of building structural systems especially in terms of a campus type or similar large-scale facility. Projects may include design of new and renovated scientific research laboratory facilities, administrative facilities (offices, operation centers, warehouses), utilities, electrical systems, water, sewage systems, ADA compliance requirements, safety systems such as fall protection devices/guardrails, solar/energy conservation systems, roofs, communications, security systems, radio transmission towers, heating/ventilation/air conditioning systems, roads, fences and gates.</p>
<p>Criteria to be evaluated in the selection for award include:</p>
<p>**(1) Construction of additions to commercial facilities, such as but not limited to laboratories which include cleanrooms;</p>
<p>**(2) Recent specialized experience (within five years) with architectural renovations, such as but not limited to, laboratory facilities, commercial window replacements, masonry repairs, exterior building repairs, and roofing;<br /><br />**(3) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including research laboratory environments; vibration analysis and environmental factors for laboratories (clean rooms), and the renovation of government facilities of different square footages built in the 1950-1960's era;<br /><br />**(4) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules;</p>

<p>(6) Ability of the firm to respond to specific tasks within the required time frame; and</p>
<p>**(7) Location of the firm within the general geographical area of the NIST, Boulder, CO and Kauai, HI Facilities, provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project. Architect-Engineering firms are advised that at least 50% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the specific project location.&nbsp; Any local area offices must have the authority to commit the firm and have adequate staff depth to assure quick response to technical and administrative matters.</p>
<p>Selected firms will work on projects partnering with a government assigned engineer/project manager to provide a complete design and procurement ready contract package acceptable for the government procurement process. All documents will be in a contract ready format and used to solicit qualified contractors requiring firm fixed prices to perform the work requirements detailed in the specifications.</p>
<p>Firms responding are requested to clearly indicate those tasks performed in house and those to be subcontracted. Firms requesting consideration are required to submit a Standard Form 330, dated 6/2004. The Government reserves the right to award more than one contract as a result of this announcement. This contract will be procured under the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36. This is not a Request For Proposal.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor is required to perform at least 50% of the labor with their own employees.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Media Activity Contracting Office is seeking sources for the MODERNIZATION/UPGRADE OF THE AUTOMATED STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM (ASRS) located at the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center (DIMOC-R) located in Riverside, CA.  This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified companies capable of meeting the Government requirement.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this RFI.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI.  This FedBizOps sources sought notice is an announcement seeking market information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Governments evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), the Government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP); however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information (e.g., use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement).

A draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) is  attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the needs of the DIMOC.  Respondents should be aware that it will be the responsibility of each offeror to submit their own Performance Work Statement (PWS) for this requirement, including functional and acceptance testing and training plans for operators and on-site start-up and routine maintenance personnel.  Respondents should communicate their ability to meet DIMOCs objectives by demonstrating successful project management and completion of similar ASRS upgrades. The purpose of this notice is to identify interested vendors  large businesses, small businesses, 8(a), Veterans Owned, etc., and to determine if a set-aside is warranted.  Responses should speak to the ability to perform the requirements contained in the SOO and provide evidence of successful experience regarding projects of this nature.

SUBMITTALS ARE REQUESTED TO BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN 25 FEB 2010.

The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of your submittal.

Interested small businesses should review and understand the requirements in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 19 and FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  In addition, the statement of qualifications should include information that clearly demonstrates the respondents capabilities, expertise and experience to perform the requirements contained in the draft Statement of Objectives.

The ammunition caliber has not been specified by the government to allow industry the greatest amount of flexibility to meet the PSR performance specification. The program will use full and open competition to fulfill the joint USSOCOM PSR requirement and the solicitation is tentatively scheduled for release in March 2010. The PSR system is designed to address the operational effectiveness and SOF sniper survivability over the current inventory of sniper weapons. The major components of the PSR system are: rifle, ten magazines, sound suppressor including a mirage mitigating device, operator manual, sling, cleaning kit, bipod, drag bag, and hard carrying case. These items have been determined to be a commercial item and are intended to fulfill the approved USSOCOM requirement for a PSR.
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 332994. USSOCOM intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (10-year) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) line items</p>
<p>Offerors will be required to provide product samples as part of the proposal. The product samples will consist of 3 each rifles with ancillary equipment, 3 each suppressors, a total of 1000 rounds of ammunition, 1 each field reject headspace gauge, and headspace gauge (minimum). Vendors will also be required to supply a weapon firing fixture per previous FBO announcement H92222-10-R-0016, published 23 December 2009.</p>
<p>The government has reserved the right to award multiple contracts. The minimum quantity is projected to be 2 each PSR systems and 4000 rounds of ammunition as test units. The government will conduct an evaluation of the test units that may result in subsequent delivery orders for PSR systems and ammunition. Vendors receiving an award will be required to provide New Equipment Training as part of the government's evaluation/ testing process. The contract(s) maximums for the PSR system is projected to be 14,064 and 28,135,000 rounds of ammunition. The contract will contain, but not be limited to, contract line item numbers (CLINs) for the following items: Provisioning Item Order (PIO), Engineering Services for product improvement/ caliber modularity development, Product Improvement to allow the continual evolvement of configuration items to meet USSOCOM requirements, magazines, bolts, barrels, bipods, muzzle devices, cleaning kits, drag bags, hard cases, ammunition test barrels, and pressure transducers. The contract will also have provisions for ordering technical data.</p>
<p>To be eligible for award, contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

NNC10CA11C. THE R&D EFFORTS WILL DEVELOP ADVANCED LOW NOX COMBUSTORTECHNOLOGY.NASA Glenn Research Center has committed support for specific efforts under the AmericanRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Recovery Act funds for NASAs Aeronautics ResearchProgram will accelerate key research, enhance the state of aeronautics for the nation,and expand the viable and well-informed trade space for vehicle design decisions andenable simultaneous realization of National noise, emissions, and performance goals. Withthe NASA Research Announcement (NRA), NNH09ZEA001N, NASA sought proposals that willidentify new combustor concepts capable of meeting N+2 NOx goals.The specific area of support for this work, per NASAs Recovery Act Program Plan forAeronautics Research, is to develop low emissions combustor concepts capable of meetingthe LTO (landing and take-off) NOx emissions reduction goal while contributing to theachievement of the fuel burn goal and without negatively impacting other emissions. Thelow emissions combustor should be capable of meeting the N+2 LTO NOx goal of 75%reduction from the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) standard adopted atCAEP 6 (Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection).

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification Review DocumentForOther Than Full and Open Competition1.  Contracting Organization:  VA Black Hills, Fort Meade, SD2.  Description of Action:  A Firm Fixed-Price contract is contemplated for acquisition of construction services from McCarthy-Anderson Construction for emergency sewer line repairs at Fort Meade VA Medical Center, Sturgis, SD.  The sewer line under Dietetics is partially blocked and appears to be broken and/or collapsed.  In the process of investigating the blockage, the VAs snake camera has become lodged in the damaged pipe and cannot be removed.  The pipe may become completely blocked at any time, so it   is imperative that the problem be resolved immediately to insure continued operation of a large portion of Dietetics. 3.  Description of Commodities:  Work consists of removing vinyl asbestos tile and asbestos mastic removal, removal of concrete, excavation, replacement and compaction of soil, demolition and replacement of cast iron pipe, replacement of concrete, new flooring, acoustical ceilings and painting.  Dietetics must continue its daily operations throughout the duration of these repairs and the contractor may be required to work off  hours to accomplish the work. 4.  Statutory Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)5.  Validity of Use of Statutory Authority:  This contractor has successfully completed many projects at this facility and has established a history of responsiveness, competence and cost control in these types of situations. They also have the manpower and experience to complete this work immediately.  If not corrected as soon as possible, the sewer line may become completely blocked and seriously impact the continued operation of Dietetics and the mission of the hospital.  There is an unusual and compelling urgency for the government to resolve the problem as soon as possible.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-2, Statutory Authority 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(2) is being cited.6. Sources Solicited:  McCarthy-Anderson Construction was the first vender contacted based on their past performance on similar projects and their availability to take on the project immediately. 7.  Market Research Conducted:  Due to unusual and compelling urgency, a minimal Market Survey was completed.  McCarthy-Anderson Construction has provided prompt and competent response to previous problems and emergencies at the facility in the past, and were the first contractor contacted.  McCarthy Anderson Construction is a small, woman owned business. 8. Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:  The following reasons are cited for choosing McCarthy Anderson Construction as a sole source contractor:  	McCarthy Anderson Construction   has successfully completed many projects at this facility and has established a history of responsiveness, competence and cost control in these types of situations.	 They have the manpower and experience to complete this work immediately.   	They are familiar with the facility, the environmental and security requirements. 10.  Actions to remove Barriers to Competition: All of the existing cast iron sewer pipe in the area excavated will be checked and replaced if necessary.  This action should prevent any blockages in this area in the foreseeable future and thus mitigate the need for emergency repairs in this area. 11.  Fair and Reasonable Price:  Pricing for previous work performed by this contractor has always been in line with Government estimates.  We anticipate negotiations with this vendor to result in a fair and reasonable price, as determined by the prepared Government estimate, as well as the prevailing costs for this type of work in this area. 12.  Contracting Officer's Certification:  Based upon the information provided herein, I believe the justification for awarding this project to McCarthy-Anderson Construction on a sole-source basis is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and recommend we proceed as such.________________________________________Contracting Officer		dateconcur________________________________________Warranted One Level Above CO		dateNOTE:  Additional approvals may be required at a level as high as the Agency Senior Procurement Executive (for procurements exceeding $50,000,000. The citation for these levels of approval is VAAR 806.304.
