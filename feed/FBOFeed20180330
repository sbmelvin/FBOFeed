An engineering review has determined the affected seats may not adequately protect the occupants, or may fail entirely, during a crash or hard-landing event. In order to eliminate this potential safety risk to human life, all of the faulty Lower Mounting Fixtures must be identified and replaced. All deliveries should be completed NLT 240 days ARO.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;contract will be awarded to the current manufacturer of the CWS Bracket. GDS the current manufacturer of the bracket is the only capable source capable of producing the kits in the time frame and meeting the specifications required to produce this critical component to satisfy a potential safety requirement to ensure military personnel are protected during an aircraft crash.</p>

<CONTACT>Patrick J Winders, Phone 7704882669, Email vxx6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) contemplates award of a firm-fixed-price sole source Contract to Central Mining Institute, Miko&#322;&oacute;w, Poland for the acquisition of large-scale layered test explosions. <br /><br />The process of deploying rock dust in an underground mine frequently results in layers of float coal dust and rock dust. This is particularly evident in belt entries where a fine layer of coal dust is deposited on surfaces as the belt operates. It has been experimentally demonstrated that ~100 g/m3 (nominal dispersed concentration) of float coal dust lying on top of dry rock dust will propagate an explosion. The results of the proposed experiments will reveal if treated rock dust is at least as effective as untreated rock dust when topped with the same nominal concentration of float coal dust. For these tests, a thin layer of less than 75-&micro;m coal dust will be distributed on top of a layer of either treated or untreated rock dust. Testing will compare relative flame propagation distances, flame velocity, and explosion intensity (impulse) for coal dust layer on top of dry untreated rock dust to those obtained with that same layer of coal dust on top of dry treated rock dust. Testing will also compare results for a coal dust layer on top of damp untreated rock dust to those obtained with the same layer of coal dust on top of treated rock dust after exposure to equivalent amounts of added moisture.<br /><br />Central Mining Institute's Experimental Mine Barbara near Miko&#322;&oacute;w, Poland consists of 200- and 400-m long underground entries with interconnected workings capable of conducting very strong dust/gas explosions, up to detonation. The cross section of the 400-m long entry is 7.5 m2 and the 200-m long entry is 5 m2 but contains an 11 m2 section for the testing of full-scale ventilation control structures. The Experimental Mine Barbara has panels containing explosion-monitoring instrumentation along the entry walls. The Experimental Mine Barbara has a long history of explosion testing. <br /><br />There is no other experimental mine that meets the requirements:<br />A. Preparation of the experimental mine test site which is needs to have a 400 m horizontal length,<br />B. Provide &lt; 75-&micro;m coal dust having similar volatility and ash content as the Pittsburgh coal seam.<br />C. Provide two limestone rock dusts: non-treated dust (NTRD) and anti-caking treated dust (TRD); <br />D. To acquire, prepare, and place the coal dust/rock dust layers,<br />E. The methane gas, ignitors, and other miscellaneous materials required for initiating float coal dust explosions, <br />F. The labor to set up each test,<br />G. The labor to conduct each test,<br />H. The calibrated instrumentation to collect data such as static pressure, flame travel, flame velocity, etc. at high speeds (all instrumentation are to be calibrated as per manufacturers' specifications), flame sensors and pressure sensors extended at least beyond 300 m from the closed end, <br />I. Provide experienced personnel to assess the data for inconsistencies or instrumentation failure,<br />J. The labor to clean the experimental mine entry after each test, <br />K. The disposal of waste material generated during each test, and<br />L. Provide mine flat car and locomotive to slowly move it along gallery while mining technicians distribute dust along the floor.<br /><br />No other vendor has been identified that can adequately meet the CDC's needs within the required timeframe.<br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification Standards (NAICS) Code is 541380. This acquisition will be negotiated under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 as only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. CDC is not requesting competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Interested parties who believe they possess the capabilities to satisfy this requirement should indicate their interest in writing and submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement no later than 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, on April 14, 2018. Determination not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Respondents will assume all financial costs for preparing a response to this notice. The U.S. Government assumes no financial obligation for the preparation and distribution of prepared responses. Inquiries may be sent to Patrick Winders via email at vxx6@cdc.gov

<p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>1. Title: Research Coordinator/Clinical Research Coordinator for the Transfusion-Related Infections Prospective Study (TRIPS)<br />2. Background Information: The CC is a clinical research hospital providing medical services for patients participating in human research protocols at the NIH. The CC provides patient facilities, services for clinical investigations, research in related areas, and training programs for residents.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) mission is to provide high-quality patient care and hospital services in support of NIH clinical research programs, to pursue research that contributes to our knowledge and practice of transfusion medicine and related technologies, and to provide advanced training in transfusion medicine.</p>
<p>The DTM Infectious Diseases Section (IDS), including the Clinical Studies Section (CSS) conducts a large-scale, investigator-initiated, and collaborative research program. The long-term goals of this research program are to: 1) study and prevent transfusion-associated infections; in the past, these studies focused on transfusion-associated hepatitis, but have now expanded to investigate all potential transfusion-transmitted agents; 2) explore new technologies for the detection and study of blood-transmitted agents including gene array and deep sequencing technology; 3) characterize novel and established blood-transmitted agents, their infectivity, and their susceptibility to inactivation/neutralization; 4) prospectively study donors infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) to determine the natural history and long-term outcome of this infection; 5) study the immunologic, virologic and gene-associated differences between HCV chronic carriers and those who spontaneously recover; 6) study mechanisms of HCV binding to B lymphocytes and downstream effects using deep sequencing and functional assays; 7) study the mechanisms of HCV binding to erythrocytes and relationship to HCV-related immune complex diseases; 8) study epidemiology and pathogenesis of transfusion-transmitted arboviruses, including Chikungunya virus, dengue virus and Zika virus; investigate the potential for infection enhancement and/or increased severity of disease with co-infection.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSALS. </strong>
<p>The NINDS Contracts Management Section of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), intends to solicit on a sole-source basis by a request for quotation to Blackrock Microsystems LLC on or around April 11, 2018 with an award issued on or around April 30, 2018. The purpose of the resultant purchase order will be to provide the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) with a high-density microarray upgrade with micro-stimulation capability to extant Blackrock Microsystems NeurPort neurological recording equipment currently in use at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit.</p>
<p><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE and SET ASIDE STATUS</strong></p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334510 with a Size Standard of 1,250 employees or fewer.</p>
<p>This acquisition is NOT set aside for small businesses, but rather is a sole-source acquisition to Blackrock Microsystems LLC.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong> <br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source provides that: For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, Contracting Officers may solicit from one source IF the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name OR industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>The Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit (FRNU) of NINDS exploits the unique investigative opportunities provided by intracranial electrical recordings during neurosurgical procedures. Using recordings captured from epilepsy patients implanted with subdural and depth electrodes, we investigate the activation of cortical networks during memory encoding and recall, and using the recordings captured during the implantation of deep brain stimulators, we investigate the role of the basal ganglia in learning and decision making.<br />The purpose of this acquisition is to upgrade existing microarray recording equipment at the Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit (FRNU) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke with the ability to safely administer electrical stimulation to the human brain. The NINDS currently utilizes a Blackrock Microsystems NeuroPort recording and acquisition system with 128-channel neural signal processing units, a pneumatic inserter and digital hubs for Blackrock Microsystems CerePlex I headstages.  NINDS has a requirement for equipment that will interface with an implantable device used to record neurological signals from and administer stimulation to the human brain. Arrays are requested to have micro-stimulation capability, stimulated by a Blackrock Microsystems CereStim R96 stimulator (or comparable equipment).  The equipment will be installed by NINDS once the service to build the equipment is completed. <br />The ability to administer stimulation is a requirement for the Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery Unit laboratory's research experiments, which aim to decipher the neural code of human memory.   The FRNU laboratory at NINDS depends upon microarrays to capture information from 10 to 150 individual human neurons at once.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Blackrock Microsystems microarrays are the only high-density single-neuron recording devices currently approved for human use. <br />Recently, Blackrock Microsystems has developed a proprietary method for administering low-levels of electrical stimulation to individual micro-array channels, and NINDS would like to upgrade its existing Blackrock Microsystems arrays to make use of this new technology. In order to ensure continuity of ongoing research experiments, it is imperative that (1) no component of NINDS' existing Blackrock Microsystems neural recording system is changed during the upgrade, and (2) that the microstimulation system integrates with NINDS' existing Blackrock neural recording equipment. For these reasons, Blackrock Microsystems is the only vendor capable of providing the service to enhance NINDS' existing arrays with stimulation capability.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR part 10, extensive market research was conducted to reach this determination. Specifically, a Sources Sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps referencing the above detailed requirements and no responses were received. Additionally, contacts with knowledgeable individuals both in industry and Government, as well as reviews of available product literature, revealed no other sources. Finally, a review of the GSA Advantage, Dynamic Small Business Search, and previous government acquisitions returned no results that meet all of the requirements. Therefore, only Blackrock Microsystems LLC is found to be capable of meeting the needs of this requirement.</p>
<p>The intended source is:<br />Blackrock Microsystems, LLC<br />630 S Komas Dr., Suite 200<br />Salt Lake City, UT  84108-1262</p>

  This is a follow-on requirement to contract N00189-14-C-Z059 whereby SENSA Solutions developed and used proprietary tools to provide career lifecycle management of the DoNâs executive cadre, which includes leadership development, workforce planning, succession management, individual competency assessments, and trend analysis of historical enterprise-wide competency assessment data.  As such, the government has determined that SENSA Solutions is the only source capable of satisfying the DONâs needs, and award to any other source would result in a duplication of cost to the Government for the development of a similar competency model that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Subsequently, the government intends to negotiate and procure these services on a sole source basis under of the authority of 41 U.S.
 Code 1901(e)(2) as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The period of performance for this procurement will be 30 September 2018 through 29 September 2019, with three one-year options.  This is not a request for quote.  Any interested parties may submit capability information in order to challenge this intent to procure the services on a sole source basis from SENSA Solutions; however, the final decision to process this requirement on a sole source basis rests with the Department of the Navy.  Capability information shall be submitted via email to Mr. Art Conkwright, arthur.conkwright1@navy.mil no later than 1600 EST on 4 April 2018.

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

<DESC>Synopsis:
The Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Boise ID (VAMC) and the Veterans Integrated Service Network 20 Optical Fabrication Laboratory (VISN 20 OFL) has an ongoing program to furnish eyeglasses to those veterans that require them and are eligible for assistance. 

This requirement is for all lens materials, labor, equipment and transportation required to provide complete ophthalmic lenses using VISN 20 OFL provided frames for beneficiaries of the Department of Veterans Administration, VISN 20 OFL. Contractors shall be capable of providing a diverse array of requirements including processing glass lenses of all types and styles, Slab Off lenses of all types, styles, and materials, AR coatings, Mirror coatings, High power lenses (powers above +/- 10D) of all types, styles, and materials, and High prismatic lenses (powers above +/- 4.5D) of all types, styles, and materials at a reasonable price. Regular orders in all materials and powers may be processed in an overflow capacity if the VISN 20 OFL goes into a backlog status. 

Market research for this requirement determined that a 100% set-aside for small business could be met. The VA contemplates awarding one but reserves the right to award multiple IDIQ contracts to small business concerns if the Government deems it advantageous.

<SUBJECT>Design Build PIT Tag Data Collection
<SOLNBR>W912EF-17-R-0034
<RESPDATE>033117
<CONTACT>Kent R. Bernard, Phone 5095277205, Email kent.r.bernard@usace.army.mil
<DESC>The two-phase selection procedures are described in FAR 36.3. The contracting officer with involvement of the PDT shall make a determination that the design-build procedures are appropriate, using the criteria delineated in FAR 36.301 (b). If appropriate, the contracting officer should use the two-phase selection procedures, unless another design-build acquisition procedure authorized by law is used.
<p>NOAA Fisheries and other regional fish managers use Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tag data to track fish movement of anadromous species as they go downstream in their outmigration and as they come back upstream heading to their spawning grounds. Information collected can be used to estimate bypass passage rates, run timing, survival and smolt to adult return rates as well as evaluate the effects of project operations. The estimated construction cost limitation (combined design and construction costs) for this project is $6,000,000.00.</p>
<p>Currently, spillway bay one functions as the surface passage route at Lower Granite and passes an average of 75% of those fish passing over all eight of the spillway bays. The Corps of Engineers does not have a way to collect PIT Tag data from outmigrating juvenile salmonids and steelhead passing over these spillways. Studies six to ten years ago indicated an average of 65% of fish passing the dam on their way downstream passed over the spillway and, as a result, were undetected by existing monitoring systems. In an attempt to collect PIT Tag information from the fish passing over the spillway at Lower Granite Dam, the Corps of Engineers intends to install a monitoring system in spillway bay one.</p>
<p>The contractor would design, fabricate, and place a steel bulkhead on the downstream end of the spill bay one deflector. The bulkhead would span from pier to pier across the spill bay (from several feet below the end of deflector (elevation &cong;630 ft) to high tailwater elevation (&cong;642 feet). The bulkhead would isolate the construction area in the spill bay from the stilling basin. The bulkhead design would be stamped by a licensed professional engineer. The bulkhead would isolate the work area from about 10-12 feet of water in the stilling basin and would need to seal tightly at the base to minimize leakage into the work area. The contractor may use a barge mounted crane moored in the stilling basin outside the work area to set the bulkhead and support the construction work. Divers may need to assist with bulkhead placement to ensure correct positioning and establish an effective seal between the bulkhead and the existing spillway deflector surface. Once the bulkhead is in place, the area between the steel bulkhead and the spillway surface or the existing spillway piers would be dewatered. Work on the spillway chute and deflector would then be accomplished in the dry. Some water leakage is usually present, so pumping water may be required throughout the construction period.<br /><br />The contractor may use any combination of methods such as saw cutting, drilling, splitting and/or high pressure water blasting to remove some concrete from the face of the existing spillway, exposing the rebar and leaving a roughened surface for placement of the new concrete forming the flatter spillway chute and modified spill deflector. Estimated concrete removal is 150 cy. The removed concrete would be captured and not allowed to fall into the tailrace pool. During concrete cutting/removal operations, all process water and waste material would be collected for treatment and upland disposal. Construction materials or fluids are not allowed to come into contact with Snake River water. The work may include drilling and grouting concrete anchors into the face of the spillway followed by installation of reinforcing steel. The contractor place concrete for the final spillway chute and spill deflector surfaces. The contractor would have to place the concrete within a limited work window, and would be required to demonstrate concrete placement on a sloped surface. All seepage water and other water from construction operations would be removed from the work area for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Should the need arise to spill water from other bays during construction, any support barges outside of the dry work area would need to be removed. Depending on levels of spill, construction may continue or be halted depending on the risk to workers in proximity to the river tailrace area.</p>
<p>A series of pass-over antennas (GFE) would be installed within the added spillway ogee surface. The antennae project an electromagnetic field up through the ogee concrete surface and spillway flow. PIT Tag data is collected from tagged fish as they pass over the antennas. Multiple antennas would be installed by the contractor and covered with a cap to isolate them from spillway flow during spillway operation. Aluminum shields would be fabricated and installed by the contractor beneath the antenna to isolate their field from magnetic elements in the spillway. If concrete is used; new concrete placement above the antennae requires non-metallic rebar and non-magnetic aggregate. Associated cabling and conduit would be installed in the spillway surface to connect the antennaes to a climate controlled shelter provided by the contractor and ground the antennae and shields. The electrical shelter would be located adjacent to spillbay one. Communications cable would include copper antenna cables between the antennas and transceivers (GFE) and fiber optic cables from the transceivers back to the existing data system in the juvenile fish facility.</p>
<p>Arbitrary dates for scheduling purposes only.<br />Contract Award: October 2017<br />In Water Work Window: December 15, 2018 - March 15, 2019<br />Construction complete: March 15, 2019<br />System operational by: April 01, 2019</p>

This RFI is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force. <br /><br />The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential businesses having multidisciplinary engineering capabilities sufficient to develop a domain connectivity software application, strand solver capability, and common scalable infrastructure, to be incorporated into a high fidelity physics-based software application for the next generation production computational fluid dynamics (CFD) Navier-Stokes flow solver for the HPCMP CREATE - AV Program. <br /><br />AEDC's mission is to test and evaluate Department of Defense (DoD) systems and subsystems at operational flight conditions in order to qualify the system for flight, improve system designs, and establish performance before production. Fulfillment of this mission requires aircraft simulation tools in the areas of aerodynamics, structural dynamics, propulsion, and kinematics and kinetics.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense High Performance Computing Modernization Program (DoD HPCMP) is currently developing a Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) tool for aircraft design and analysis. The resulting program is called the Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments for Air Vehicles (CREATE-AV). Two of the three physics-based simulation software products being developed as part of the program are Kestrel and Helios. Kestrel delivers virtual design test and analysis capabilities for fixed-wing aircraft (full spectrum - fighter, bomber, tanker, reconnaissance, etc), while Helios provides that same capabilities for rotary-wing aircraft. The CREATE-AV Helios and Kestrel software products utilize a dual mesh paradigm. Specifically, this is use of either a strand grid or unstructured grid near a surface geometry (of an aircraft) to resolve boundary effects, and a high-order Cartesian system of grids away from the body. The desired organization must be able to develop the grid assembly software application that will enable efficient interpolation between the strand (unstructured) grid and the far-field (Cartesian) grid. This dual mesh combination presents a novel and very powerful paradigm that none of the other commonly used domain connectivity tools is currently exploiting. Exploitation of these attributes is on the critical path to development of both Kestrel and Helios. The capability captured by this unique paradigm enables true automation of domain connectivity, is highly scalable, and enables efficient memory use.</p>
<p>All interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing a capabilities/information package. The capabilities package should be no more than 10 PAGES in length, MS Office compatible, single spaced with 12 point font. In addition to the information package, interested parties are highly encouraged to submit short answers to our ATTACHED QUESTIONNAIRE.</p>
<p>Please include your company name, point of contract, address, telephone number, Duns and Bradstreet Unique Numbering System (DUNS) number, and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code. Firms responding to this notice should state whether they are, or are not, a small business concern, a service-disabled veteran owned small business, or a HUBZone business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 541511, small business size (revenue) standard of $25,500,000.00. The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this RFI, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.</p>
<p>In accordance with Far 52.204---System for Award Management, interested parties shall ensure that they are registered in System for Award Management. To register in SAM, go to https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or call 1-866-606-8220 for assistance.</p>
<p><br />3. SECURITY<br />The deliverables for any contract award associated with this potential requirement along with all preparatory materials and software shall be considered International Trade Agreement Restricted (ITAR) until downgraded by the buyer. Should a solicitation result, all offerors must have a current certified DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. Further information regarding certification is available at www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/default.asp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;QUESTIONNAIRE FOR INDUSTRY</p>
<p>1. Should the Government award a contract based on our potential requirement, we will require unlimited data rights regarding any and all software, software documentation, and source code developed as a result of the awarded contract, including components and modules provided/included in the final software. Would this requirement deter your business from submitting an offer/proposal in response to a request for quotation/proposal?</p>
<p>2. This effort is anticipated to last for approximately three years. Please provide a rough order of magnitude cost for budgetary purposes. As opposed to a lump sum, please provide the ROM at the task level.</p>
<p>3. Should the government award a contract based on our potential requirement, development would likely involve access to HPCMP CREATETM - AV Project source code, which is controlled under ITAR Protocols. Please describe the environment in which development work will be executed and measures that will be in place to ensure that export controls associated with HPCMP CREATETM - AV Products are maintained.</p>
<p>4. Describe your firm's background in working within the Defense Supercomputing Resource Center environment and network.</p>
<p>5. Describe your firm's familiarity with the internal architecture and source code of the HPCMP CREATETM-AV Kestrel and Helios products.</p>
<p>6. Describe your firm's experience and abilities as it relates to developing, incorporating, testing, maintaining and supporting production quality software components to the HPCMP CREATETM-AV Kestrel and Helios products in the following subject areas: domain connectivity algorithms, strand mesh in the near-body portion of a dual-mesh paradigm, and the "Common Scalable Infrastructure" known as CSI.</p>
<p>7. Describe your firm's experience and abilities as it relates to work with the HPCMP CREATETM-AV development groups to ensure that the software components fit into the automated Kestrel and Helios test harnesses and that the software components meet software development standards of the projects.</p>

<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase Brand Name or Equal Bayer Healthcare ZEISS Axio Scan Z.1 system for Brightfield and Fluorescence detection.</p>
<p>The NCI Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) functions as a translational research program dedicated to the design and development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer treatment and prevention. A major effort in our laboratory is the study of novel combinations of cancer vaccines, cell-based therapies, checkpoint inhibitory antibodies, and a variety of immunomodulatory agents that impact the tumor phenotype and the number and activity of various anti-tumor immune cell types. These studies are being conducted in vivo in animal models, both with murine tumor models and human xenograft models. To understand the changes that are taking place at the tumor site when various combination immunotherapies are administered, the NCI laboratory is planning to evaluate tumor tissues (primary and metastasis) for the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, B and NK cells, and a range of other immune cells that could reduce the tumor response to immunotherapy, including macrophages, myeloid cells, and regulatory T cells. Moreover, the phenotype of the tumor will be also assessed. These studies require the use of multiple, fluorescently labeled antibodies for identification of each cell type, as well as the subsequent quantification of the number of each cell type and its location relative to the tumor cells. Such evaluation requires the scanning of the whole tissue slides in various fluorescent channels. Similar studies are being conducted with tumor biopsies obtained from patients included in ongoing immunotherapy clinical trials, at various treatment stages. These studies will help understand whether a particular immunotherapy combination is more effective at inducing an anti-tumor immune response Genomics Core. In addition, this study provides the NCI intramural investigators with a range of genomics technologies, available either as services delivered by the core, or as walk up access to specific instrumentation and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>The requested instrument will allow the NCI to:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Effectively obtain high quality digital images of these various analyses.<br />(2) Archive the pathology images generated in digital form.<br />(3) To quantitatively and comparatively evaluate the expression of the markers investigated.</p>

This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>NAVAIR desires a platform independent physiological monitoring/alerting system qualified for use in a Naval Aviation Environment that can provide real-time information about aviator physiologic and cognitive status in flight. The organization that provides this capability must be able to develop and rapidly field a technology solution that provides a reliable method for detecting / predicting and alerting the aircrew of an impending physiological event (e.g., hypoxia, hypercapnia, decompression sickness, etc.) that may result in degradation of psychomotor performance so that aircrew can take timely corrective action.</p>
<p>The organization must be familiar with / able to:</p>
<p>&bull; Understand tactical military aviation environment (i.e., flight support equipment and clothing, environmental stresses, tempo, physical constraints/demands, etc.)<br />&bull; Physiological monitoring / alert system must be compatible with current tactical military aviation environment<br />&bull; Aeromedical needs and capabilities, human element and physiology<br />&bull; Provide a physiological monitoring / alerting system that provides insight into cognitive status<br />&bull; The organization must also possess an advanced/detailed understanding of the physiological monitoring / alerting system hardware and software to support timely correction of deficiencies identified during test or after the system is fielded.</p>
<p>NAVAIR requests that interested organizations submit a white paper including a capabilities statement to NAVAIR Contracts (AIR 2.5.1.15). (See instructions in Section III) (RFI responses due 30 April 2018 @1600 EST)</p>
<p>II. DATA PROTECTION</p>
<p>This RFI is an exchange of information between Government and Industry. It is the first step of an iterative process aimed at understanding the existence of sources that can deliver solutions to the capabilities described herein. Additional RFIs requesting further detail may be issued in the future to continue the Government's informational exchange with Industry. Information received as a result of this request is expected to be sensitive and/or proprietary to the responding company and will be protected as such. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosures; however, it is incumbent upon the respondent to appropriately mark all submissions. In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share the information within the Government and any responses marked in a manner that will not permit such internal Government review may be returned without being assessed or considered.</p>
<p><br />III. INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>RFI Responses:</p>
<p>Organizations should submit a white paper including a capabilities statement package that (1) provides the proposed physiological monitoring / alerting system capabilities, including product description and (2) provides examples of the organization's prior experience working with a physiological monitoring / alerting system. Respondents are welcome to provide multiple responses that vary the emphasis between cost and capability considerations. The respondents should clearly delineate the differences in each response identified.</p>
<p>It is requested that the unclassified response have a page limit of 20 pages, double-spaced, 11- point font, and must be in English.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS NOTICE. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This notice is a market research tool used for planning purposes only to determine the availability and capability of small business sources.
Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC MIDLANT) is seeking Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) Businesses with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel and capability to perform a proposed contract.
A Non-recurrent type, performance-based contract is anticipated.
 The total contract term including the exercise of any options, shall not exceed 60 months. Lowest Price Technical Acceptable Source Selection procedures will be used to evaluate and select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government. The Contractor shall provide all labor, material, equipment, supervision, and transportation necessary to provide Type A, B, and C preventative maintenance, troubleshooting, load and weight testing, inspections and certifications, and any necessary routine and emergency repairs to Category 1 A, B, C, and D shore mounted marine pedestal luffing cranes.  These pedestal cranes also are equipped with unique computers and software features for special operations.
  The four (4) luffing cranes have computers that have the ability to synchronize to work in pairs of two (2) when performing joint lifting operations.  The software for the computer system is proprietary to McGregor USA Inc. and requires the OEM to be the only vendor to be able to provide software updates as crane operational problems are identified in the field, or make any changes. Therefore, any possible contractor must be an authorized/certified McGregor distributor capable of working on these cranes.   The Navyâs tight training schedules require minimal crane down time for emergency or scheduled preventive maintenance services, and the OEM has the trained mechanical staff and crane engineering expertise to provide the quickest service repairs possible.
 

All work is to be performed at Cheatham Annex, Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, Virginia.  Authorized technicians must receive International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements (UR) Z17 certification to provide operation and maintenance services.

The Government will not pay for any information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. One of the main functions of this synopsis is to assist the Contracting Officer in determining whether Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, certified HUBZone Small Business, and certified 8(a) is an acceptable strategy for this procurement.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov.

The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period.

<DESC>This is a Market Research and Sources Sought Notice for information on capability and availability of potential Small Business contractors to perform construction services in support of the Huntington District's Construction Program.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT synopsis and is not a solicitation announcement. The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of potential qualified Small Business firms to establish Small Business Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOC). This notice neither constitutes a solicitation announcement, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, please do NOT request a copy of a solicitation. It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the government in making appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District, anticipates a future construction program to perform various small construction projects primarily within its Area of Responsibility (AOR), which includes a major portion of Ohio, most of West Virginia, northeastern Kentucky, and a small portion of Virginia &amp; North Carolina (See Huntington District boundary map - Attachment 1). The government is also exploring expanding the area of where work can be performed to anywhere within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division boundaries (See Great Lakes and Ohio River Division boundary map - Attachment 2) which include the remaining Districts (Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Louisville, Nashville, and Pittsburgh), and is seeking information from the small business community on how this would impact their decision to submit a proposal on any future solicitation.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the proposed contract is to provide site survey, work plan(s), construction, maintenance, repair, and/or rehabilitation (MRR) services. The Contractor shall be required to perform/manage all facets of the work such as surveying the problem, recommending a solution and correction of the problem in a timely manner. The Contractor shall maintain the capability to provide quick response for this work. Work requirements shall vary from site to site.</p>
<p>The contract(s) would require the contractor to be capable of mobilizing sizeable crews to multiple work sites and possess multimillion-dollar bonding capability. The contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, supplies, and materials necessary to perform work associated with task orders. The cost of individual projects are generally anticipated to be within the range of $100,000.00 to $3,000,000.00 for small business concerns. The proposed MATOC would have a performance period of five years (one (1) year base period with four (4) one year option periods)</p>
<p>Typical tasks performed under this contract could include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Emergency mobilization (within 24 hours) of experienced construction crews capable of handling immediate disaster response, Flood Damage Reduction (FDR), and/or Interim Risk Reduction Measures (IRRM) to multiple work site(s) (capable of running a minimum of 3 jobsites). <br />&bull; Emergency mobilization (within 24 hours) of experienced construction crews (including professional surveying services) capable to support the above with various sized equipment including, but not limited to, dozer(s), end loader(s), dump truck(s), etc. intended for use in Dam and Levee Safety.<br />&bull; Various small repair/maintenance/construction projects to the existing infrastructure.<br />&bull; Utility work.<br />&bull; General site work involving clearing, excavation, grading, paving, etc.<br />&bull; Working on and around Levees, Locks and Dams. <br />&bull; Land-based stream bank protection and excavation site work.<br />&bull; Construction or remodeling of small to large buildings.<br />&bull; Small bridge construction.<br />&bull; Demolition of small to large structures and restoration of cleared areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Sources for Small Business concerns are being sought for firms with a North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) of 237990, which has a size standard of $36.5 million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Responses are requested with the following information, which shall not exceed a total of 15 pages.</p>
<p>1) Offeror's name, home office and/or local office assigned to perform work address, points of contact with phone numbers and e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>2) Business size/classification to include any designations as Small Business, 8(a), Woman-Owned, HUBZone, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business.</p>
<p>3) Will consolidating these various small construction project requirements into a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) for a base period and four one year option periods impact your ability to compete for this requirement?</p>
<p>4) What negative impacts, if any, will your firm experience as a result of the consolidation of these construction projects?</p>
<p>5) If the consolidation were limited to performance within the Huntington District boundaries (See Huntington District boundary map - Attachment 1), will that impact your ability to participate in this type of requirement for other Districts (specifically within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division)?</p>
<p>6) If the Huntington District established multiple regionally based contracts (divided the performance area within the Huntington District boundaries into 2 to 4 smaller geographic regions), would that change your ability to participate compared to performance under a MATOC within the entire Huntington District boundary?</p>
<p>7) If the area were expanded to require performance anywhere within the Great Lakes and Ohio River Division boundaries (See Great Lakes and Ohio River Division boundary map - Attachment 2), how would that impact your decision to propose and/or your ability to perform on the MATOC?</p>
<p>8) If a design-build requirement (combining design and construction in a single contract with one contractor) were added to the MATOC, how would that impact your ability to participate?</p>
<p>9) Provide bonding capability (construction bonding level per single contract and aggregate construction bonding level, both expressed in dollars), along with current bonding capacity.</p>
<p>10) Description of capability to perform the proposed construction (see typical tasks above) within each region, manage subcontractors, prepare and comply with various environmental and construction permits, and capacity to execute this project with other ongoing construction projects. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with your response as a separate attachment and will not count against the 15 page limitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) Past performance/experience on projects of similar scope and magnitude for which the firm acted in the role of prime contractor, describing no more than five (5) projects that are at least 50% construction complete within the past five years of the issue date of this Notice.

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Education intends to award sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Centrieva-WEAVE, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

This software allows the university to monitor assessment of faculty curriculum, administrative support services and develop reports, records, findings and assists with strategic plans for future operation.  The software is proprietary in nature.  This is for the annual subscription fee for unlimited campus-wide use of WEAVE on-line.  The WEAVE subscription has already been implemented throughout campus and the university documentation and research has been entered into the system for annual cycle assessment purposes.  We need to continue with functionality of the software and services in order to prepare for the accreditation site visit, adequately assess curriculum, and create corrective action plans for improving our shortcomings.  
The purpose of this procurement is to award based on a sole source requirement, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  This notice is not a request for competitive quotations.  A solicitation will not be available for this requirement.  The intent of this notice is for informational purposes only.

<p>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity for industry partners to use LLNL's new </span>ALE3D for Industry software on LLNL's high-performance computing resources.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ALE3D <em>(short for Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian three-dimensional analysis)</em> is a versatile multi-physics simulation tool used to solve 2D and 3D engineering and physics problems developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). LLNL is offering a new version - customized for industrial use - called ALE3D for Industry to be run on LLNL's high-performance computing resources.</p>

<p>With ALE3D For Industry, companies and academic users will have access to one of DOE's premiere multi-physics codes and the ability to run on Livermore Computing's HPC platforms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For over 30+ years, LLNL has been developing its ALE3D multi-physics simulation tool and providing it for U.S. Government use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>ALE3D has had extensive validation and verification and is used to solve a wide variety of 2D and 3D engineering and physics problems.

<p>Customized for industrial uses, the ALE3D4I code allows a user to not only switch between the Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques but also combine the two so that the mesh "relaxes" at the leading edge of the object. The amount of relaxation is determined by the user, who can "weight" the simulation so that more zones are forced into a specific area of interest, for greater accuracy at that spot. Supporting mesh relaxation broadens the scope of applications in comparison to codes that are restricted to Lagrangian- or Eulerian-only approaches. For some applications, ALE3D4I can deliver accuracy similar to that of other simulation techniques but with as few as one-tenth the number of mesh elements.</p>
<p>Beyond its foundation as a hydrodynamics and structural code, ALE3D4I has multi-physics capabilities that integrate various packages through an operator splitting approach. Additional features include heat conduction, chemical kinetics, species diffusion, incompressible flow, a wide range of material models, chemistry models, multi-phase flow, and magnetohydrodynamics, which can be used in numerous combinations for long (implicit) to short (explicit) time-scale applications.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Electrochemical measurements in aqueous solutions are typically measured against a well-characterized and widely used reference electrode (RE), such as silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), saturated calomel electrode (SCE), or reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Ag/AgCl reference electrodes can be used in some ionic liquids, however, the high solubility of AgCl in some ionic liquids greatly limits their use. As no other convenient reference electrode currently exists for electrochemistry in ionic liquids, potentials are often measured and reported against a quasi-reference electrode (QRE). In the ionic liquid literature, this QRE is typically a silver or platinum wire, which is immersed directly in the electrolyte. <br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The redox reaction occurring at the surface of the QRE is not known and can vary with wire purity and cleanliness, and therefore the potential of the QRE is likely to vary between labs and experiments. Furthermore, the potential of the QRE can change during the electrochemical experiment due to dissolution, reaction, or polarization, and potential drifts of 10s to 100s of mV throughout experiments are often observed. The potential of the QRE must be reported against a well-defined redox couple (e.g. ferrocene) to allow comparisons of potential to be made between experiments. However, as ferrocene is typically added at the end of the experiment, this one-point calibration of the QRE does not necessarily apply throughout the entire experiment, as the QRE may drift during the measurement.<br /></span><br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Currently, the only commercially available REs for ionic liquids or other non-aqueous solvents are based on a silver wire in a tube separated with a porous frit, which contains a fixed concentration of Ag+ ions (typically 10 or 100 mM). This Ag/Ag<sup>+</sup> RE exhibits good stability, with a variation of only 1-8 mV between measurements made over the course of a few weeks. However, it must be prepared and used in a glove box and protected from light, as the Ag<sup>+</sup> salt is air/moisture and light sensitive. This Ag/Ag<sup>+</sup> RE must be prepared frequently due to diffusion of the silver ions out of the electrode, and the photoreactivity of the silver ions.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL has developed a reference electrode that is a great improvement on the widely used silver or platinum wire QRE commonly used in electrochemistry in ionic liquids. This new reference electrode, based on a silver-sulfide coated silver wire, exhibits greatly improved stability over a QRE. The stability of our RE approaches that of the Ag/Ag+ RE, but unlike the Ag/Ag+ RE, the RE reported here is not sensitive to light and can be made and used without a glovebox. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, the long-term stability of our RE is far superior to any RE reported in the ionic liquid literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode can be used in non-aqueous electrochemistry work to provide a stable reference potential throughout multi-day measurements with minimal drift in potential. The Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode is a single-junction or double-junction electrode containing the same electrolyte inside and outside of the reference electrode body, thereby minimizing the junction potential. The reference potential is fixed by the silver sulfide coating on the silver wire, which establishes an equilibrium with the filling solution of the reference electrode. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode has been found to have minimal interference from air or moisture when assembled and used outside of a glovebox when it is used with air/moisture stable electrolytes.</span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode provides a major improvement over commonly used quasi-reference electrodes, which have unstable and unknown reference potentials. It is robust and generally maintenance free. Unlike reference electrodes containing a fixed concentration of ions (i.e. Ag<sup>+</sup> ions), which are susceptible to potential drift due to leaching or breakdown of the ions, LLNL's Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode relies on a dynamic equilibrium between the stable Ag<sub>2</sub>S coated Ag wire and the filling solution, thus providing a longer shelf-life and usage lifetime for the reference electrode.</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">LLNL's Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode can be used for electrochemistry in any electrolyte, such as ionic liquids, organic solvents, or aqueous solutions. It can be used in an inert atmosphere, or in a normal air atmosphere. The Ag<sub>2</sub>S coating is very stable after formation, and it is envisioned that this reference electrode can be sold as a kit containing the Ag<sub>2</sub>S coated Ag wire plus reference electrode tube with a frit, and the customer can fill the reference electrode with their desired electrolyte.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">LLNL's Ag/Ag<sub>2</sub>S reference electrode was initially developed as a 4 mm x 50 mm mini electrode for use in a small volume cell, however, it could be further miniaturized in a capillary tube, or scaled up to a conventional reference electrode size.</span></p>

<DESC><p>N00164-18-S-NB63- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/SOURCES SOUGHT - STRATEGIC RADIATION-HARDENED MICROELECTRONICS - FSC 5999 - NAICS 334511</p>
<p>Issue Date: 30 MAR 2018 - Closing Date: 16 APR 2018 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/Sources Sought Notice as part of market research for Strategic Radiation-Hardened Microelectronics (SRHM). This RFI/Sources Sought Notice is for the purpose of determining industry sources with strategic-level radiation-hardened microelectronics manufacturing capability using Radiation Hardening By Process (RHBP) and Radiation Hardening By Design (RHBD) at less than or equal to the 0.8 &mu;m Silicon on Insulator (SOI) technology node and that can meet existing U.S. Government (USG) requirements. Additionally, it provides industry with a method to communicate any feedback regarding the requirements, acquisition strategy, and any other relevant matters.</p>
<p>The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) requires implementation of a broad range of ongoing and new programs of record for near, medium, and far term strategic modernization to assure the viability of the U.S. Strategic Triad that will provide deterrence through the mid-2040s against known or projected strategic threats. The NPR findings further require assuring and maintaining a robust industrial base to provide the highest technological capabilities for these strategic initiatives. One of the most critical elements for modernization and sustainment of strategic nuclear weapon system programs of record is to assure a viable proven supply base is maintained for uninterrupted design, development, and production of SRHM components at the highest levels of production-demonstrated SRHM.</p>
<p>The SRHM sources must internally possess the facility, knowledge, and extensive successful experience in the design, layout, manufacturing, packaging, and testing of SRHM components using RHBP and RHBD. Sources will have access to classified information up to and including the SECRET level. The sources must be a Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA)-accredited Trusted Supplier, i.e., a currently operational Trusted production foundry. This is required in order to support the Department of Defense (DoD) certification to Congress by 31 December 2020, stipulated by Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Section 1670, which states that the "capability to produce or acquire strategic radiation hardened trusted microelectronics, consistent with Department of Defense Instruction 5200.44, is operational and available to supply necessary microelectronic components for necessary radiation environments involved with the acquisition of delivery systems for nuclear weapons." In order to support this certification requirement, sources must utilize in-house, Trusted wafer fabrication lines. The products must be certified to a strategic radiation-hardened level of at least the currently fielded strategic delivery systems, which include features, density, performance, power, radiation-hardness, reliability, and an end-to-end Trusted flow/supply chain. These products would include, but are not limited to: memories, processors, custom Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), and mixed signal and low-voltage analog (&le;5V) components. Radiation hardness levels are specified by MIL-STD-750, MIL-PRF-19500, and other documents. If necessary, interested parties may request additional clarification of the radiation hardness requirements by email to the POC for this solicitation.</p>
<p>In addition, the source of SRHM must be able to provide dynamic, interactive support for the design and development of innovative science and engineering projects in the form of Multi-Project Wafers (MPW). After comprehensive collaboration in the design phase, these MPW must be fabricated on the source's existing, in-house fabrication line to support the development of novel SRHM technologies for the next generation of USG strategic deterrent. The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking.</p>
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a basic ordering agreement, to the current source for these items, Honeywell International Inc., 12001 Highway 55, Plymouth, MN, (CAGE 27330).

<SUBJECT>66--Notice of Intent to Negotiate on a Sole Source Basis
<SOLNBR>68HE0C18R0008
<CONTACT>Young, Sean
<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.501(a), Sole Source Acquisitions, with PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc., for a NexION 2000P Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).

The EPA has identified PerkinElmer Health Sciences, as the only contractor able to provide the equipment with the unique capabilities and specifications in one instrument that EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), located at 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH  45268 requires to meet its minimum needs. 

PerkinElmer Health Sciences is the sole manufacturer and distributor of NexION 2000P Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass spectrometer (ICP-MS).  The NexION 2000P ICP-MS is the only Mass Spectrometer that can do what is required to satisfy the EPA's minimum needs as stated below:  

1. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer shall detect the concentrations of dissolved ions, suspended particles at extremely low concentrations in environmental matrices. 
2. The instrument shall be used to distinguish the difference between inorganic compound that are in the ion form or as nanoparticle (1 to 100 nm).
3. The instrument shall verify the presence of particles, their concentration, composition, size and size distribution, dissolution and agglomeration tracking in a single run.
4. The instrument shall be able to see two elements per single nanoparticle.
5. The measurement shall allow real time nanoparticles visualization of number, size, concentration and composition.
6. The instrument shall have a fast continuous data acquisition with no settling (or overhead) time between consecutive readings to allow processing large volume of one hundred thousand data points per second. 
7. The instrument setting and data processing shall allow measuring nanoparticle events in the plasma as low as 10 dwell time that allows a continuous data acquisition rates as fast as 105 Hz. Hence, the instrument shall allow fast continuous data acquisition with no settling time, and with no overhead time between consecutive readings and dwell time must be 10 Âµs or less.
8. The instrument shall allow full characterization with a signal acquisition rate of no less than 6 Million data points per minute that allows full characterization of a sample in less than 60 seconds.
9. The instrument shall allow users to read a minimum of 100,000 data points per second to acquire and process data from the nebulizer, mass spectrophotometer.
10. The instrument shall allow the calculation of particle size in the sample mix flown through the nebulizer based on the integration of signal peak area.
11. The instrument shall enable the determination of individual particle signal profiling for differentiation between ionic and particle fractions.
12. The single cell ICP-MS shall be upgradable to operate in the single-cell mode meeting the capabilities listed below in item 13 to 20.
13. The measurement shall allow the determination of mass of metal content per cell, from cellular uptake of metals (dissolved or metallic nanoparticles) or measuring the intrinsic metal content of the cell.
14. The instrument shall have the ability to differentiate between the dissolved and cellular fractions of the same analyte. The instrument shall allow the ability to clearly separate between exogenous ions and those endogenous to the cell.
15. Dwell time shall be 10 Âµs or less Single cell ICP-MS and upgradable to operate in the Single Cell mode meeting the capabilities listed below in items 16 to 20 
16. The instrument shall allow the determination of the mass of metal content per cell, from cellular uptake of dissolved metals ions to elemental nanoparticles up taken including measuring the intrinsic metal content of the single cells.
17. The instrument shall provide mass distribution of nanoparticles concentration of cells containing metal or nanoparticles.
18. The single particle ICP-MS shall allow the EPA to determine the number of nanoparticles per cell and assists to differentiate between the dissolved and cellular fractions of the inorganic matter.
19. The instrument shall also have the ability to clearly separate between ions and particles that are originating from outside an organism (exogenous) and those coming from the cell (endogenous)
20. The instrument shall have software that eliminates the need for labor-intensive data processing by summarizing the above mentioned characteristics and allowing for easy reprocessing and export to Microsoft Excel.

The NexION 2000P is the only ICP-MS that can achieve the required tasks without additional auxiliary units, and its equipment has the following unique capabilities:

<SUBJECT>H--GPS/Iridium satellite collars and repair of TGW-4577-X GPS/Iridium collars
<SOLNBR>140G0318Q0046
<CONTACT>Lushenko, Nikolas
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, Bozman, MT intends to issue a non-competitive Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award to Telonics, Inc. of Mesa, AZ. The requirement is the purchase of GPS/Iridium satellite collars and repair of TGW-4577-X GPS/Iridium satellite collars that were previously deployed on grizzly bears and have been recovered from the field.

Telonics, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing GPS/Iridium satellite collars with the following unique features required to meet Government minimum needs.

1) As required by the USGS Animal Care and Use Committee protocols, USGS cannot use belting materials that may result in injuries to the animal; therefore, collars must be built with the collar material and sizing as per specifications provided as follows: Belting thickness must be composed of two layers of butyl belting (1/16" brown butyl) over (1/8" white butyl) with a thickness no greater than 3/16". Belting width must be no greater than 2 inches and no less than 2 inches in order to prevent neck injuries.

2) Collar size adjustment where cotton space must be integrated into the collar itself.

3) The ability to use a remote release mechanism that uses the Iridium satellite network to allow collar release at any time (i.e., not pre-programmed). This remote release mechanism must have a programmable backup release mechanism in case of 2-way communication failure

4) Metal housing necessary to withstand substantial forces exerted on the units due to unique grizzly bear behaviors and interactions with conspecifics and other wildlife.

5) Collars with drop-off mechanism and adjustable belting must not exceed 900 grams while also meeting the minimum life-span requirements of at least 5 years.

6) Collars must allow on-demand downloading, where attempts to download data are user defined rather than automatically preset

7) Collars must contain a secondary battery to provide additional VHF operation without impacting overall weight/size of the collar.

8) Collars must allow for user-upgrading of firmware updates without sending units back to the manufacturer.

9) GPS/Iridium antenna housings should have rounded edges and protrude no more than 3/4" from the top of the collar belting to prevent shearing of antenna during rubbing behaviors. These dimensions is critical to assess the risk of antennae failure due to typical grizzly bears behaviors, specifically rubbing behaviors that affect the collar where the antennae are located. Grizzly bears frequently rub against trees and sharp edges and corners provide more opportunity for antenna to catch during this behavior. Furthermore, the farther an antenna housing protrudes from the collar housing, the more torque can be applied to the antenna attachment points during rubbing behavior. Shearing/damage of antenna housings during rubbing is a serious concern for collar performance and longevity. The accuracy of the clock on board the unit must provide breakaway time accuracy of +/- 6 minutes per year at 25Â° C typical and +/- 30 minutes per year for -20 to +40Â° C.  

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334220 - Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing, size standards 1,250 employees.

The USGS intends to make a non-competitive award to Telonics, Inc. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), and FAR 16.5. The anticipated contract will be firm fixed price 5-year IDIQ award. A vendor must be registered at http://www.sam.gov to be awarded the contract. 

All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

Quotations shall only be accepted through electronic mail addressed to nlushenko@usgs.gov. All documents required by this notice must be uploaded and received in their entirety no later than April 9, 2018 at 1700 ET. Quotations submitted by hardcopy or the Fed Connect web portal or Fed Connect Message Center shall not be accepted or considered.

<DESC>The Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) is the single logistics center for the Coast Guard surface fleet providing engineering, maintenance, supply and technical information services to the Coast Guard cutters and boats stationed throughout the United States. The SFLC purchases a wide variety of marine goods and services and we are committed to small business participation in our acquisition programs to support the fleet. The SFLC posts its upcoming forecast of opportunities on the Acquisition Planning Forecast System (APFS), which is a portal for small business vendors to view projections of all anticipated opportunities estimated to exceed $150,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with the SFLC or perform part of the effort through subcontracts. APFS identifies all upcoming forecasted, but not necessarily funded, opportunities at http://apfs.dhs.gov/.
<p>We hope that APFS will assist you in doing business with the SFLC. By helping vendors identify procurement opportunities as early in the acquisition process as possible, we hope to improve communications with industry and assist the small business community with its marketing efforts. Vendors seeking to track upcoming SFLC opportunities may register to be notified when anticipated opportunities are published in APFS. AFPS is continually updated and informs the public of our projected requirements estimated to exceed $150,000 early in the process. Information on this site is organized in a manner to permit various data sorts and descriptions of required supplies or services and program points of contacts so that vendors can call and inquire about the specific program needs prior to formal solicitations being released. Marketing efforts are most effectively conducted with the Program Offices, since they originate the requirement and prepare the associated market research report. Vendors are encouraged to have their technical experts communicate with our technical personnel, as their knowledge of advances in technology and the firm's capabilities are much more helpful to us than generic sales presentations.</p>

<p><strong>DOI-AAAP-0050 Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (Feb 2016)<br /></strong>a. FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15.<br />b. The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.<br />c. We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer (CO) with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official (AO). Information in the report must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.<br />d. When your Contractor Representative(s) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at https://www.cpars.gov/. <br />e. Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the AO will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at https://www.cpars.gov/. <br />1. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. <br />2. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the AO's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. <br />3. All information provided should be reviewed for accuracy prior to submission. <br />4. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating No comment in the space provided, and then selecting "Accept the Ratings and Close the Evaluation".<br />5. Your response is due within 60 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR. On day 15, the evaluation will become available in PPIRS-RC marked as "Pending" with or without comments and whether or not it has been closed.<br />6. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 60 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: -The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment.- <br />f. The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:<br />1. Protect the evaluation as source selection information. After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the CO for instructions.<br />2. Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.<br />3. Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, pre-award surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.<br />g. If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the CO no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 60-day review period.<br />h. A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.<br />(End of Local Clause)</p>
