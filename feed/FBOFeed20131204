<DESC>Army Contracting Command-Warren plans to issue a sole source solicitation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. (BAE Systems) for the Conversion of Bradley M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) into the Bradley M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) for a total quantity of up to 150 vehicle conversions.  It is the Government's intent to award the initial base quantity of 70 vehicle conversions as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) letter contract with BAE Systems (cage # 06085). It is also the Government's intent to separately issue a sole source solicitation for the additional option quantities of 80 conversion vehicles.  The letter contract would allow for a quantity of 70 conversion vehicles with the remaining 80 conversion vehicles separately solicited and negotiated into the definitized contract.  The purpose of this acquisition is for the repair and conversion of Bradley vehicles from the M3A3 to the M2A3 configuration.  These converted vehicles will support the digitization of the Combat Engineer vehicles as directed in the recent Army Force Structure redesign and the removal of the analog Operation Desert Storm (ODS) configuration engineer vehicles from Bradley A3 units.  The conversion of the vehicles from the M3A3 to M2A3 configuration will also modify the interior stowage capabilities, periscope locations, and ramp configuration, and increase the number of squad seats.  This effort is synopsized to notify of potential subcontracting opportunities as required by FAR 5.201(c).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Edgewood Contracting Division intends to negotiate with MRIGlobal, Inc., 425 Volker Blvd Kansas City, MO 64110 under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1)(i), for maintenance/sustainment of the Individual Protection Ensemble Mannequin System (IPEMS) facility at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah. The IPEMS was designed, developed and installed at DPG by MRIGlobal under competitively awarded contract. <br>  <br> MRIGlobal designed IPEMS as a highly specialized unique system which is in the component level verification stage of development and consists of an integrated IPE Mannequin, exposure chamber, and control room.  Since the IPEMS is incomplete, and the required maintenance program has not been fully developed, the Government requires a contractor familiar with this highly specialized one-of-a-kind system to perform the maintenance during FY2014. Currently, the Government does not have trained individuals on site at DPG with operational knowledge and experience to properly sustain the IPEMS facility. Purchase Order award is anticipated no later than 30 September 2013.   <br>  <br> This is not a request for quote.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Natick Contracting Division (ACC-APG-NCD), on behalf of the U.S. Army Product Manager - Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) has a requirement for a Global Positioning System based navigation system for use during clandestine air infiltration missions.  The PARANAVSYS will provide a reliable and easy to use navigation system that will allow for accurate, automated mission planning, precise determination of the release point in the aircraft, the ability to update the mission profile as required prior to deployment and real time navigation information during infiltration to multiple drop zones.  The system will allow for enhanced mission capabilities due to the elimination of environmental and visual limitations of the current doctrine.  It will increase the operational capability of Commanders to infiltrate parachutists by air surreptitiously into enemy held or denied territory, maintaining unit integrity and maximizing Force Protection at multiple drop zones with near simultaneous landings, during all weather and light conditions.  This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> It is anticipated that a final Fedbizopps Announcement and RFP will be released in January of 2014 with proposals due an estimated 30 days after release of the RFP. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates awarding a five (5) year Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The NAICS Code is 334511 (Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing).  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards or no awards as a result of any solicitation.  The minimum contract requirement is for four (4) Navigation Units and two (2) Mission Planners for each contract awardee.  The maximum contract requirement will not exceed 10,000 Navigation Units and 1,000 Mission Planners. <br>  <br> Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders, and not by the basic contract.  In accordance with FAR 15.306(a) (3), it is the intent of the Government to evaluate proposals and may award without discussions.  This is being procured IAW FAR Part 15. <br>  <br> When released, the RFP, including all amendments and applicable documents (with the exception of patterns, if applicable) will be available in electronic medium at U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Natick Contracting Division at https://www3.natick.army.mil and through Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov. <br>  <br> NOTICE:  All data contained herein is for informational purposes only and is subject to change.  In the event of discrepancy between the information shown on this web page and the actual RFP documents, the actual RFP documents and amendments thereto shall govern.

<DESC>Bureau of Reclamation's Upper Colorado (UC) Region, which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, encompasses Utah and New Mexico, western Colorado, northeastern Arizona, southwestern Wyoming, west Texas, and small portions of Nevada and Idaho.  The UC Region is involved in a wide variety of issues, programs, partnerships, and activities that reflect Reclamation's mission as a manager, developer, and protector of water and related resources.  Pursuant to Public Laws 84-485 15, 87-483 15, and 87-590 6, as amended, the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to continue studies of quality of water of the Colorado River Basin, to appraise its suitability for municipal, domestic, and industrial use and for irrigation in the various areas in the United States in which it is used or proposed to be used, to estimate the effect of additional developments involving its storage and use on the remaining water available for use in the United States, to study all possible means of improving the quality of such water and of alleviating the ill effects of water of poor quality.
Through ongoing quality of water studies, the UC Region monitors reservoir water quality and collects data and samples representing the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the water.  Samples of phytoplankton and zooplankton are regularly collected from the following UC Region reservoirs:  Lake Powell, AZ-UT; Flaming Gorge, UT-WY; Fontenelle, WY; McPhee, CO; Navajo, CO-NM.  Analyses of phytoplankton are used to indicate primary productivity and analyses of zooplankton are used to indicate secondary productivity in different bodies of water.  Analyses of both types of plankton are key indicators in characterizing the health of reservoirs.  It is important to obtain consistent and reliable taxonomic identification for the integrity of the projects.  
This is a solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.5-Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in the performance work statement that shall be attached to the Solicitation.  Reclamation plans to issue an Option Year Contract for the analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton samples, including the current inventory of backlogged samples.  This will be a base year plus four 1-year options, with an expected period of performance into 2019.  This procurement shall be 100% small business set-a-side, under NAICS Code 541380-Testing Laboratories, with a size standard of $14M.

<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The subject requirement is for acquisition of 1 NSN. The requirement will result in an award of a Firm Fixed price contract. The solicitation will be available in DIBBS on or about December 9, 2013 at http://dibbs.dscc.dla.mil. The AMSC code of 3D implies that parts procured under this NSN are candidates for other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, and past performance evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>This solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted acquisition.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is restricted to domestic sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-3. Accordingly, foreign sources, except Canadian sources, are not eligible for award.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong>
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Cartagenia, 485 Massachusetts Avenue, Suite 300, Cambridge, MA 02139-0418 to provide additional BENCH Communication Module LIMS Integration Services for NHGRI.</p>
<p>IT and 508 Compliance is not required, was initially instituted on the base contract.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Procurement:</span></p>
<p>This is a Follow-On Requirement. This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research. NHGRI also supports the training of investigators and the dissemination of genome information to the public and to health professionals. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, MD. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p>To continue and maintain compatibility NHGRI will procure additional services provided by Cartagenia Bench platform software, which is required by the Undiagnosed Diseases laboratory to reliably and systematically sift through large lists of patient genome variants derived from next generation sequencing and SNP microarray data in order to make informed calls on variants that are potentially deleterious and the cause of the unique disorders seen in admitted Undiagnosed Diseases Program patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, the BENCH Communication Module (BCM) for LIMS Integration and the Integration Services acquisition is to further develop communication between the LIMS 24/7 platform that is already in use in the lab and the BENCH platform software that is also currently in use. The communication module will allow the transfer of data between the Cartagenia BENCH software and the LIMS and will allow the LIMS to execute and monitor analysis of SNP chip and exome data from UDP patients and their families. It is also an integral part of the LIMS development and connectivity to allow the transfer of data from the Cartagenia software to other analysis software, to collaborators and to generate necessary reports. Cartagenia is the sole provider of the BENCH platform software and is the only provider of the BENCH Communication Module as well as the LIMs Integration services that will accompany the module.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance:</span></p>
<p>Base: 3-Months from the initial award.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Justification:</span></p>
<p>The intramural NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP) has been given the additional mandates of founding and training extramural UDP sites and providing classes for analysis of next generation sequencing data and SNP chips. To this end, the UDP requires a mechanism by which it can uniformly provide mentoring and a common database for analysis of genomic and sequence variants. Cartagenia Bench Platform software provides the only integrated SNP chip and next generation sequence analysis platform with a web-based interface that can service multiple sites and allow hierarchical access according to permissions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regulatory Authority:</span></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Information</span>:</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511--Custom Computer Programming Services and the Small Business Size Standard is $25.5M. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-71, November 25, 2013.</p>

<DESC>ADVERTISEMENT FOR PREQUALIFICATION<br />For Central Tender No (163/2013)<br />December 2013
<p><br />Title: Invitation to Prequalify Contractors for<br />Construction of the East Jerash Wastewater Treatment Plant, Jordan</p>
<p>Contact Point: Ministry of Public Works and Housing<br />Government Tenders Department<br />Eighth Circle King Abdallah Street<br />Amman Jordan<br />Fax: 962 6 5857583, 962 6 5857639<br />Email: w-biddings@gtd.gov.jo<br />Website: www.gtd.gov.jo<br />P.O. Box 1220, Amman 11118, Jordan<br />Tel: 962 6 585 8311/14</p>
<p>The Water Authority of Jordan/Ministry of Water and Irrigation (WAJ/MWI) of Amman, Jordan, through the Government Tenders Department (GTD) invites expressions of interest and submission of completed prequalification questionnaire from Construction Service firms who can demonstrate the required experience and capability in construction of water and wastewater services for the purpose of developing a shortlist. The project comprises the construction of a wastewater treatment plant and auxiliary facilities, at the existing East Jerash WWTP in the Jerash City of Jordan. One Host Country Contract with WAJ is anticipated. Award will be made to the lowest responsive responsible bidder. Payment will be made in both US Dollars and Jordanian Dinars (JD). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will finance the US Dollar portion through a direct letter of commitment. Financing of the JD portion will be made by WAJ; Issuance of this request does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the WAJ or USAID, nor does it commit WAJ or USAID to pay for costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any information. It is a requirement that all applicants comply with USAID geographic code 937 pursuant to applicable source and nationality regulations as defined in USAID Automated Directives System, Chapter 310, and the Code of Federal Regulations 22 CFR Part 228, and supplemental references. Geographic Code 937 is defined as the United States, Jordan (the cooperating/recipient country), and developing countries other than advanced developing countries, and excluding prohibited sources (USAID ADS, Chapter 310). USAID has certain approval rights, including but not limited to, approval of the list of prequalified contractors, the selected contractor, and the contract award. The exercise of USAID approval rights is not, however, to be construed in any case as making USAID a party to the Contract. Construction services firms will be evaluated for prequalification to bid in accordance with the evaluation criteria found in the Prequalification Package. Construction services firms are expected to demonstrate the following information, which will be used for the evaluation process: (1) extensive experience and capability in similar types of civil, mechanical and electrical construction work, (2) similar services and work experience within the past five years in the Middle East and/or Jordan and/or similar developing country environment, (3) satisfactory completion on schedule of large water/wastewater projects, (4) a history of satisfactory bonding capacity, and (5) the net current assets or available working capital that will be sufficient, in the judgment of WAJ and USAID to satisfactorily execute the contract and to meet all financial obligations incurred. The firm's current financial statement and an affirmative statement that the firm can meet USAID's source and nationality regulations must also be submitted. Copies of interested firm's brochures and annual reports may also be of value in presenting the firm's qualification. If a joint venture seeks prequalifications, qualification information must be supplied with respect to all firms in the joint venture. Firm's data will be verified. It is anticipated that the successful bidder will sign a host country contract(s) with WAJ to provide construction services subject to availability of funds. The Prequalification questionnaire can be downloaded free of charge from GTD web site www.gtd.gov.jo Due date for submittal of the completed questionnaire is 12:00 noon local Jordanian time on Thursday, 16 January 2014. To the following address <br />:<br />Ministry of Public Works and Housing,<br />Government Tenders Department, <br />Eighth Circle King Abdallah Street, Amman Jordan,<br />Fax: 962 6 5857583, 962 6 5857639,<br />Email: w-biddings@gtd.gov.jo, <br />Website: www.gtd.gov.jo, <br />P.O. Box 1220, Amman 11118, Jordan, <br />Tel: 962 6 585 8311/14.</p>
<p>Qualification packages received after the due date will not be accepted under any circumstances. If the application is delivered by courier or other method, the Applicant is responsible for its timely delivery. Applications delivered after the time stated will not be accepted.<br />WAJ and GTD will establish a short list of qualified bidders who will be permitted to purchase the bid documents and submit bids for the contract(s). The Invitation For Bids (IFB) is expected to be available for distribution to qualified firms approximately in the first quarter of 2014. Bidders will be allowed sixty days from the date of issuance of the IFB to prepare and submit their bids. The estimated duration for construction is 720 calendar days. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United States Agency for International Development encourage and welcome in this activity the participation to the fullest extent possible, of minorities and women both as individuals and as members of contracting or sub-contracting firms. In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every practicable use of such personnel and firms.<br /><br />Expressions of interest will be publicly opened at 1:00 p.m. the same day.

<p><br />BRAND NAME: (APPISTRY, LARGE APPLIANCE (SOFTWARE) AND HOSTING OF 512 NODES)</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHMENT A: IT SECURITY PROVISIONS AND ATTACHMENT B: 508 COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE.</p>
<p>A. Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a trans-National Institute of Health (NIH) initiative that focuses on the most puzzling medical cases referred to the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. It was organized by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR) and the NIH Clinical Center. Many medical specialties from other NIH research centers and institutes contribute the expertise needed to conduct the program, including endocrinology, immunology, oncology, dermatology, dentistry, cardiology and genetics, among the dozens of participating senior attending physicians. A longstanding medical condition that eludes diagnosis by a referring physician can be considered undiagnosed and may be of interest to this clinical research program.</p>
<p>Genomic DNA is isolated from all admitted Undiagnosed Diseases patients and family members. Depending on the phenotype of the patient, these DNA samples are sent for exome sequencing as the first step to obtain variant information that may determine the mechanism of the patients' disease. It is necessary for the Undiagnosed Diseases Laboratory to then perform extensive analyses on the large amount of exome sequencing and variant data that is generated in a timely manner to facilitate genetic studies when combined with SNP analysis. This information will then be used to perform research experiments to discern the genetic and molecular basis of the unique disease of the patient. Critical to accomplishing this goal is the use of the diploid alignment methodology developed in the NIH UDP.</p>
<p>B. Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The current use of alignment of NGS short reads to a monoploid canonical reference is successful for the majority of a random individual's genome that has adequate entropy given current sequence lengths and error rates. However, in the absence of other corroborating evidence, the NIH UDP needs a complete survey of the entire genome before committing the resources to validate candidate variant(s). To generate a more complete alignment, the diploid-alignment pipeline uses SNP chips, leveraged with imputation based on 1K genome haplotypes, to modify the canonical reference into two different parental references that are subsequently used to align short reads of an offspring. Time complexity is increased by 3.5X over standard monoploid alignment thereby requiring HPC resources and expertise to provide results in reasonable timeframes.</p>
<p>C. Scope of Work:</p>
<p>NHGRI will establish a collaboration to develop the next generation sequence alignment and genotyping tools that will be available to the research community, including NIH.&nbsp; NHGRI will provide the Contractor the genetic data (SNP chip data and Illumina lane fines (sequence data) from up to sixty (60) patients from the Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP. The information is collected with patient consent obtained under Clinical Protocol Number: 76-HG-0238. No personally identifiable information or code to such personally identifiable information will be provided.</p>
<p>The Contractor will integrate Ayrris into NIH CIT Biowulf which will allow all NIH<br />UDP genomic data to remain within the NIH instead of being transferred to an outside data center, which would eliminate the time to transfer data to and from Bethesda and will enable other NIH Biowulf users to leverage the Ayrris computing environment when the Diploid-Alignment is not running.</p>
<p>D. Project:</p>
<p>The Contractor will use the data to implement and refine the processes developed by the NIH UDP for diploid alignment and subsequent genotyping and annotation of next generation sequence data derived from UDP patients.</p>
<p>Information will be provided to the Contractor by secure mail, by encrypted ftp or on an encrypted hard drive. Specifically, the Imation Defender external USB hard drives that provide secure hardware encryption in a tamper-resistant metal closure and use hardware-based encryption of FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated (Certification #1269) will be utilized; this meets federal regulatory requirements for encryption of sensitive, but unclassified data. The Contractor agrees to store the information in a suitably secure and confidential manner that restricts access by any individual not involved in the Research Project. Upon completion of the Research Project the Contract will forward the results and conclusions obtained during the Research Project to NIH/UDP and upon request, destroy or return to NIH/UDP all copies of the information that are in the Contractor's possession. This information may not be used in Human Subject Research.</p>
<p>E. Other considerations:</p>
<p>1. Ability to use Appistry Inc. Large Appliance.<br />2. Compliance with HIPAA, Safe Harbor and CLIA Regulations.<br />3. Ability to integrate the system in partnership with RuRo Inc., LIMS 24/7 System.<br />4. Must show proof of HIPAA Compliant Encrypted Infrastructure for Storing and Analyzing Protected Health Information (PHI).<br />5. Ability to process more than 1000 exomes in accordance to UDP diploid alignment and genotyping pipeline within 6-months.</p>
<p>F. Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Twelve (12) months from the date of award.</p>

1.0     INTRODUCTION

The Fleet Readiness Center Southeast (FRCSE) Jacksonville, FL.
 requires professional/technical support services to license and maintain the FlightVizTM/ FlightAnalystTM software applications currently in use by the T-45 Fleet Support Team (FST) under Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) program support. 

2.0     BACKGROUND

Commander, Naval Air Force, is responsible for providing combatant commanders with the most combat ready and operationally efficient Naval Air Forces possible, and along with other Department of the Navy (DON) leadership, has recognized MFOQA as a priority initiative for minimizing risks and improving operational efficiencies in Naval aviation.  The DON MFOQA knowledge management process was derived from a program implemented by commercial airlines, known as Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA), in which aggregate flight data are analyzed to identify trends in flight operations for use in improving safety and maximizing economy.
  In addition to the aggregate data collection and analysis methodologies proved beneficial by commercial aviation, the DON MFOQA concept includes flight data analytical and visualization capabilities following each flight that are available at the squadron level for aircrew debrief and post-flight aircrew and aircraft systems performance analyses.  

In 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense informally directed DON, Air Force and Army to fund MFOQA demonstrations based on proposals submitted by each of the Services leading safety organizations.  The DON MFOQA Demonstration began in FY05.  With Commander, Naval Air Force, concurrence, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Safety) selected the Marine and Aviation Division (Code 5300), Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock, as the technical lead for the DON MFOQA Demonstration.
  In order to accomplish the objectives of the DON MFOQA Demonstration project, systems were fielded and initial standard operating procedures were developed at select aviation squadrons to collect and process flight data from aircraft and simulators to demonstrate and evaluate the MFOQA knowledge management process.  Focus areas include flight operations, maintenance, training and safety.  Upon completion of the DON MFOQA Demonstration, Chief of Naval Air Forces (CNAF) directed continued support for operational units utilizing and equipped with fielded MFOQA Systems in an effort to ensure continued utilization and integration with local commands and identification of developed and maturing requirements for integration with Naval Air Systems Commands MFOQA procurement process The routine collection and analysis of flight data also supports Fleet aviation management programs, including flight data monitoring, mishap and incident investigations, Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Aircraft and Engine Structural Integrity Programs (ASIP/ENSIP), aircraft development programs and aircrew training.
 

In order to sustain the discovered efficiencies developed, continue refinement of DON MFOQA requirements, emphasize the DON-wide risk mitigation strategies associated with awareness of MFOQA strategies, and continue to optimize the development of processes and procedures to accelerate the fielding of MFOQA production systems, continued support is needed to sustain and enhance residual MFOQA capabilities in use by participating Fleet squadrons and commands.  Additionally, CNAF, in close coordination with the collaborative MFOQA team formed and operating within the USN community, intends to expand the CNAF MFOQA Bridge Program to include wing level operational requirements by accomplishing the specific tasks contained in this document.
 These elements will allow for the proper information flow to facilitate the continuing development/integration of MFOQA processes into fleet operations at every level within the USN aviation community. 

Specifically, the T-45 FST supports the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) located at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, TX. in their training of Student Naval Aviator  flight officers. The T-45 aircraft is based at four sites, NAS Kingsville, TX. (NASK), NAS Meridian, MS. (NASM), NAS Patuxent River, MD. (NASPAX), and NAS Pensacola FL. (NASP). The purpose of the MFOQA program is to monitor aircraft performance for maintenance, operation, safety and training by processing aircraft stored data.
 The data is downloaded from each aircrafts Aircraft Data Recorder and imported into the FlightVizTM/ FlightAnalystTM software applications for analysis. 

3.0	SCOPE
The contractor shall provide software maintenance, reports/documentation, and technical services support for T-45 DON aviation squadrons utilizing MFOQA ground stations with FlightVizTM/FlightAnalystTM software applications. This software requires a unique configuration for each aircraft type/model/series and applicable mission profile, and a superior level of proficiency with the software in order to successfully integrate the capabilities of the software with the operational requirements of the select units supported.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Rock Island District is seeking Small Business Concerns capable of providing marine rock placement on the Mississippi River backwater area to create environmental habitat. The work consists of but is not limited to: furnishing all plant, labor material, and equipment necessary for constructing a rock closure structure, bank line protection, and a rock chevron. Only river access is available. <br>  <br> The rock closure structure would be constructed in Garner Chute and would require approximately 20,000 TN of riprap. Approximately 1 acre of trees would need to be cleared and removed from site at the closure structure tie in. Most rock placement would be in water. The lowest elevation for rock to be placed is at approximately elevation 513 ft MSL (flat pool is 528 ft MSL). A top width of 15 feet (at up to a top height of 532 ft MSL) with specified upstream and downstream slopes will be required. Excavation of existing material to tie in the structure will be required.   <br>  <br> Huron Island bankline protection will consist of a specified depth of bedding stone (~9,000 TN) and riprap (~16,000 TN) that would be placed along approximately 2,500 linear feet of Huron Island along Huron Chute. The rock would be placed to specified slopes. The lower third of the protection would include locked log placement which includes laying large trees into the rock protection and extending these into the chute. Approximately 2 acres of trees would require removal from the site. Excavation of existing material to tie in the structure will be required.   <br>  <br> The island protection will consist of a specified depth of bedding stone (~2,000 TN) and riprap (~4,000 TN) and will be placed on the upstream end of a small island in Huron Chute (similar to the Huron Island bank line protection). A small offshore chevron is also being evaluated for this project. Both designs would require rock placement in the water.   <br>  <br> No clearing of trees greater than 4 inches in diameter with loose peeling bark shall be allowed between April 1 and September 30 (During the Indiana Bat Breeding and Rearing Season).   <br>  <br> Coordination with the USFWS and IA DNR prior to any tree cutting may be required. <br>  <br> Coordination with the IA DNR personnel is required prior to working during the seasonal waterfowl and deer hunting seasons. During peak hunting weekends or dates, all construction activities may be required to cease for a short period of time.   <br>  <br> Copperbelly and diamondback water snakes emerge from hibernation in early spring (April) when temperatures reach 64 to 72 degrees F. USFWS and IA DNR personnel shall survey areas under construction for snake activity during this period as a precaution to keep these snakes from being destroyed while they are still lethargic. Construction activities within these areas of suitable snake habitat shall be restricted if such activities are identified. Heavy equipment shall be restricted from this habitat and normally be lifted within 7 to 10 days when the snakes are active enough to escape the disturbance. <br>  <br> No clearing of trees where roosting or occupied nests exist shall be allowed when bald eagles or red-shouldered hawks are present in the area. Although there are known nest sites on Huron Island, currently, none are known to exist within 660 feet of the selected measures. If any nesting activity is observed, no construction activities within 660 feet of the nest shall be allowed.   <br>  <br> The entire project site is within the Mississippi River and is therefore highly susceptible to water fluctuations that may impact work progress. No physical work at the project site shall be required 1 December through 15 March. Standby cost will not be paid.   <br>  <br> This project will have a base bid with approximately 40,000 TN of riprap, approximately 11,000 TN of bedding stone, and approximately 4 AC of tree removal. Between 15 and 20 locked logs will be installed on Huron Island. This construction project has an estimated range of $1 to $5 million. The construction of this project is anticipated to take multiple years depending on the options awarded. The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) Code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding size standard of $33,500,000. <br>  <br> All interested Small Business Concerns are encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought Notice. Contractors are reminded that THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential Small Business Concerns prior to determining the method of acquisition. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall not constitute responses to the solicitation, which is not currently available. This Sources Sought Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition is in the Government's best interest. <br>  <br> Please email the following documentation to the Point of Contact listed below. <br>  <br> 1.) Relevant experience in performing efforts of similar size and scope to that of the project description above within the last five (5) years. <br>  <br> 2.) A list of equipment (plant type, size, etc) the contractor is proposing to use. <br>  <br> Email responses with the information required above must be sent to Brunson.E.Grothus@usace.army.mil no later than 2:00 PM Central Standard Time on 13 December 2013. If you have any questions or comments regarding this notice, please contact Mr. Brunson Grothus at (309)794-5241 or by email at Brunson.E.Grothus@usace.army.mil <br>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of an upgrade to the current PSV-300 Doppler Scanning Laser Vibrometer for the Turbine Engine Fatigue Facility (TEFF) of AFRL/RQTI to the PSV-500 system. AFRL/RQTI will also trade in the currently owned PSV-300 for credit towards the purchase of the upgraded system. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c).<br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 334516. Size standard is 500 employees. <br />The proposed source is Polytec Inc, 16400 BAKE PKWY STE 200, IRVINE, CA, 92618-5603. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires an upgrade to an existing system. To completely replace the system would be far more expensive then performing the upgrade which keeps the equipment viable. Polytec Inc. is the only known source for this system as they are the original equipment manufacturer and only seller of their products. <br />The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM at 866-606-8220. SAM website: www.SAM.gov

<DESC>This synopsis is a special notice and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).
<p>On November 15, 2013, CMS posted presolicitation notices which informed industry of the pending solicitations for the Beneficiary and Family Centered Care (BFCC) Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) contract and the Quality Innovation Network (QIN) QIO contract.</p>
<p>This special notice serves to inform industry that CMS intends to conduct a preproposal conference on Monday, December 16, 2013 in the CMS Auditorium located at 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21244 at 9:00 a.m. local time.</p>
<p>This conference will include information regarding the future structure of the QIO Program as well as upcoming acquisition opportunities for the BFCC-QIO, QIN-QIO, and other QIO-related work under the program. An agenda will be provided on the morning of the conference.</p>
<p>This conference will begin at 9:00 a.m. local time, and is planned to continue through approximately 5:00 p.m. local time.</p>
<p>Participants may attend the conference in two ways: 1) in person at the CMS Auditorium; or 2) via webinar for visual presentation with teleconferencing supplementation for the audio.</p>
<p>In-person Participating Instructions:</p>
<p>To register for the event, please go to http://www.cms.gov/apps/events/upcomingevents.asp and provide the names of the attendees, company name, and attendee phone numbers for all in-person registrants. Please note that this information will later be distributed to all the conference attendees to allow for potential partnering arrangements. Registration is required no later than 5:00 p.m. local time, on Thursday, December 12, 2013 for in-person attendees. Conference registration will close once the seating limit has been reached or on December 12, 2013, whichever comes first. CMS strongly suggests that registrants refrain from making travel arrangements until you receive confirmation from CMS that your registration is received. CMS cannot grant in-person access to individuals who have not pre-registered to attend.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE ATTENDANCE LIMITATIONS: Potential offerors will be limited to two (2) attendees per company if you plan to propose as a prime offeror. If you are planning to participate as a subcontractor, registration will be limited to one (1) person per company. There will also be a call-in teleconference made available for those who are unable to attend in person and for any additional personnel from any companies in attendance.</p>
<p>Since the conference begins at 9:00 a.m., we recommend that in-person attendees arrive at the location at 8:00 a.m. local time to provide adequate time to go through security and complete the in-person registration process. Information about visiting the CMS complex - including important information about security procedures and our no-smoking policy - is available online at: http://cms.gov/About-CMS/Agency-Information/CMSHeadquarters/index.html. The CMS Auditorium is a secured area and identification will be required.</p>

Participants who wish to register for our webinar must do so no later than 5:00 p.m. local time on Friday, December 13, 2013, at https://webinar.cms.hhs.gov/qio-registration/event/event_info.html. Registered participants will receive information about calling in to the event once they complete registration successfully at this link. Please note that registration information will later be distributed to all the conference attendees to allow for potential partnering arrangements. Due to limited webinar/phone lines, potential offerors will be limited to the use of five (5) lines per company. When registering teleconference attendees, please also provide the number of phone lines to be used, so CMS can accommodate all participants. Due to the limited number of webinar/phone lines available, registrations will be accepted on a first-come first-served basis. You must dial-in in the first ten (10) minutes of the conference to ensure that your call is received.</p>
<p>CMS intends to solicit BFCC-QIO and QIN-QIO requirements under full and open competition. This special notice is not a request for proposal (RFP). CMS anticipates release of an RFP for BFCC-QIO work and an RFP for the QIN-QIO work on or about December 5, 2013. The solicitations will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. It will be the offeror's responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitations are to be posted for any amendments to the RFPs.</p>
<p>Questions in response to this notice related only to the preproposal conference shall be submitted electronically to this email box: QIOProgram@cms.hhs.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education (ED), Office of Communications and Outreach (OCO), intends to purchase a subscription to POLITICO Pro.  POLITICO Pro is a subscription-based news service distributed by email and accessible online. The subscription provides breaking news coverage and analysis of politics and Education issues. Users receive customizable alerts and daily newsletters.  POLITICO Pro is an authoritative news source on Congress and national politics.  POLITICO LLC is the publisher and is currently the only source for subscription.  The Government intends to solicit POLITICO LLC dba POLITICO Pro, 1100 Wilson Blvd, 6th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209 on a sole source basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  ED intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for a 12-month Base Period with two 12-month Option Periods.<br /><br />OCO leads ED's communications and outreach efforts and oversees press relations, publications, contacts with organizations, and communication with parents, educators, students, and citizens.  OCO is responsible for social media, press releases, speeches, photos, ED blog, and ED publications, among other duties.  While multiple news agencies cover Congressional activities and politics, POLITICO is the leader in subscriber-only content delivered promptly and tailored to an organization's needs.  No other source has been found to provide the timely breaking news and in-depth, targeted coverage that POLITICO Pro provides.  OCO has subscribed to numerous news sources and publications over the years and finds the quality of journalism and relevance of content provided by POLITICO to be unmatched.&nbsp;<br /><br />Market research, including a comparison of previous acquisitions, internet searches, requirement search on General Services Administration (GSA) schedule e-Library, Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) website search, and Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) search, determined that POLITICO Pro is not available on GSA schedule or through resellers.<br /><br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to meet the requirement in writing to the identified point of contact on or before the Response Date.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely to determine whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by ED not to compete this proposed action on a full and open basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of ED.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations .<br /><br />The NAICS Code size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement will be processed pursuant to FAR Part 12, Acquisition of  Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 4.5pt"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license intellectual property rights to commercialize its technology Convergent Polishing for polishing flat and spherical, round and rectangular surfaces on glass of various aspect ratios (width/thickness).</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Steps in a typical optical fabrication process include shaping, grinding, edge grind/polish, full aperture intermediate polishing or lapping, full aperture final polish and sometimes small tool polishing. Significant advances in precision optical fabrication have been made since the invention of the laser in 1960 when the demand for high optical quality material including precise surface rose dramatically. In the past 30 years, there has been significant advancement with respect to the ability to deterministically remove material during the grinding process based on advancement in tooling and real-time diagnostics using Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) grinders. Similarly the advent of small tool polishing and magneto rheological finishing has revolutionized the polishing industry. However, full aperture lap polishing is far from reaching the status of deterministic process. Incremental improvements have been made but conventional polishing still requires highly-skilled opticians often using artisan techniques. This type of polishing requires multiple, often long, iterative cycles with multiple process changes to achieve to the desired surface figure.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">LLNL's apparatus and method of Convergent Polishing specifically named CISR (<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">C</strong>onvergent, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">I</strong>nitial surface independent, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">S</strong>ingle iteration, <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">R</strong>ogue-particle free) polisher would allow for performing this operation in a single iteration under a fixed, unchanging set of polishing parameters regardless of the initial shape of the workpiece.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The principles behind how LLNL's CISR polisher works is essentially all the factors contributing to non-uniform spatial material removal on the optic have been eliminated except for optic-lap mismatch which leads to convergence of the optic surface figure to desired shape and the sources of entry and creation of rogue particles into/in the polisher system have been removed or are actively removed which leaves little/no scratching of the workpiece.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Advantages:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">LLNL's CISR polisher has the following advantages: 1) polishing parameters are fixed and remain the same during/between polishing runs regardless of the initial surface figure of the workpiece; 2) polishing can be done in a single iteration from the ground state since the workpiece figure will converge to desired shape matching that of the lap leading to less polishing time and less metrology; and 3) polishing is performed in a rogue particle-"free" environment leading to little or no scratching on the workpiece. Ultimately, these advantages lead to the ability to make high end optics faster &amp; cheaper.</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Potential Applications:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Potential applications include manufacturing of optics used in high power or high energy laser or optical systems; as well as general manufacturing of optical flats and spheres.</span></p>

<DESC><p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1"><br />The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of River Protection (ORP) intends to award a firm-fixed price modification to Contract Number DE-EM0002103, by means other than full and open competition. DOE ORP intends to award a sole-source contract modification to EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc., located at 2345 Stevens Drive, Suite 240, Richland, WA 99354. <br />Work under Modification 004 will support development of the vitrification process for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP). The WTP is expected to treat both high-level waste (HLW) and low-activity waste (LAW).<br /><br />CLIN 0012: Enhanced HLW Glass Property Composition Models - Phase 2<br />WTP has developed glass property-composition models to control glass compositions for HLW vitrification at the Hanford Site in Richland, WA. These models are based on data from crucible scale tests to the DM1200 HLW Pilot Melter tests, but focused mostly on high-Fe HLW. In addition, these models are based on the glass property-composition data collected under DOE&nbsp;ORP Contract No. DE-AC27-01RV14136 (Design, Construction, and Commissioning of the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant), which have much lower waste loadings than compositions subsequently developed for ORP for HLW processing. More recently, EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc. has developed new high waste loading formulations with good processing characteristics for Hanford HLW with high concentrations of Fe, Al, Al+Na, Cr, Bi, S, and P. To utilize the advantages of these formulations for HLW processing at the WTP, the HLW glass property-composition models need to be updated to incorporate these new compositions. ORP has started a program to incorporate the new HLW glass property data into the models; Phase 1 of that work is on-going. <br />The models of interest include PCT, T1% (crystallization), TCLP, viscosity and electrical conductivity, of which T1% is expected to be the most constraining with respect to waste loading. Nepheline formation during CCC heat treatment is another factor to be considered in models and is particularly important for high-Al and high-Al+Na HLW. Development of new HLW models is expected to be a multi-year task with various activities. The proposed work scope elements for FY14 are listed below:<br />Assess the current database, including data from the on-going Phase 1 work, and identify composition spaces in the database that need augmentation.<br />Develop statistically designed composition matrices to cover the composition regions identified in the above analysis.<br />Prepare crucible melts of glass compositions (about 50) from the statistically designed composition matrix and measure the properties of interest.<br />Incorporate the above property-composition data into the database.<br />Assess existing models against the augmented dataset.<br />Future work is expected to include preparation and characterization of additional crucible melts to address data gaps from the above assessment, and augmentation of property-composition databases with the new data followed by development of new models. Preparation and characterization of crucible melts in phases, with assessment of the data in between, is expected to be more efficient in addressing the data gaps and require fewer new crucible melts as compared to preparing and characterizing all of the crucible melts together.<br /><br />CLIN 0013: Redox Effects and Corrosion of High-Bi HLW Glass<br />Hanford tanks contain a number of HLW streams that are high in bismuth and phosphorous. Under previous tasks funded by ORP, glass formulations were developed for some of these HLW streams and melter tests were conducted. The results from that work showed that these glasses are very sensitive to redox changes. Bismuth is a relatively easily reducible species that has the potential to form molten metal phases that can be detrimental to melter operations and melter lifetime. The test results have also shown that the HLW glasses with high bismuth contents can be quite corrosive towards metallic melter components such as Inconel 690. Severe corrosion was observed in the DM1200 bubbler, especially under partially reducing conditions. There is a need to determine the viable range of operating conditions that do not lead to formation of molten metal phases and to investigate the corrosion of metallic melter components and potential mitigation strategies.<br />This task will focus on redox effects in high-bismuth HLW glasses and corrosion of metal components. High-bismuth HLW glasses will be subjected to various redox states in controlled atmosphere furnaces and characterized to determine the effect of the redox state on secondary phase formation, and especially the formation of metallic phases. A limited number of tests will also be conducted to explore potential additives to mitigate adverse effects of high bismuth in HLW glass. High-bismuth HLW glasses previously developed for ORP will be used in the studies. The results will be analyzed to determine potential operating ranges. A further aspect of the work will be to determine the effect of redox state of the high-bismuth HLW glass on the corrosion of alloys such as Inconel 690 and MA758 that are frequency used as melter materials of construction. Corrosion tests will be conducted under controlled redox conditions to determine the effect of redox state on alloy corrosion. <br /><br />CLIN 0014: Phosphorous and Calcium Constraints for HLW Glass<br />A significant fraction of the projected HLW feed batches to the WTP HLW vitrification facility will have relatively high concentrations of phosphorus. In some composition ranges, high levels of phosphorus can lead to the formation of crystalline phases such as calcium phosphate. The calcium can originate from the waste itself or from the glass forming chemical additives. Since many of the high phosphorus HLW batches are also high in sulfur, there are potential benefits to the addition of calcium to increase sulfate solubility in the glass. However, this can also increase the tendency for calcium phosphate formation. Consequently, there is a need to develop constraints and/or models that can be used to define the acceptable ranges of phosphorus and calcium contents that avoid calcium phosphate crystallization over the likely range of HLW glass compositions. Previous ORP System Plan projections have employed a simple preliminary constraint for this purpose, but there is a need to extend the underlying data set in order to support the development of improvements on the present approach.</p>
<p>In this task, existing data on calcium phosphate formation in HLW glass compositions will be reviewed and data gaps will be identified. This information will be used to develop a test matrix of new glass compositions to address those gaps. The new glasses will be prepared and characterized with respect to formation of crystalline phases on heat treatment. While the particular emphasis of this work will be on calcium phosphate, all crystalline phases that form will be identified and quantified since data on other phases are valuable for the development of other property-composition models. The new data will be combined with existing data and the data set will be used to develop improved models for the prediction of calcium phosphate formation in HLW glasses. Other phases that that may be limiting for high-phosphorus HLW streams will also be identified.<br /><br />CLIN 0015: Effect of the Form of Iron on HLW Melt Rate<br />Previous testing performed for ORP has demonstrated that the form of aluminum in the HLW stream can have substantial effects on glass production rates during HLW vitrification. In view of the very high concentrations of iron in the Hanford HLW inventory and the complex chemistry involved in the production of the mix of iron species present in those wastes, there is significant potential for iron speciation to result in similar impacts on HLW melt rates. As is the case for aluminum, iron is likely present predominantly as various hydroxides, oxides, and oxy hydroxides. The majority of the existing melt rate data on high-iron HLW compositions have been obtained with simulants that were prepared using a precipitated iron source that is nominally ferric hydroxide but which likely consists of a mix of different phases. <br />In this task, the previously used iron source will be characterized with respect to the types and quantities of the various phases that are present. The results will be used to identify other potential iron sources that differ significantly in the types and quantities of the phases that are present. In addition, the limited available characterization data on actual Hanford HLW samples will be reviewed for information on iron-containing phases. This information will be combined and used to develop a test matrix to assess the effects of different iron sources on glass production rates. A high-iron HLW composition and corresponding glass formulation will be selected for these tests. Simulants will be prepared that are identical except for the form of iron that is used. Melter feeds will be prepared and subjected to melt rate testing on a DM100 melter system. The data will be analyzed to determine the potential range of effects of iron source on melt rates in comparison to rates that are obtained with the extensively tested nominal iron source.<br /><br />CLIN 0016: Support for HLW Feeds <br />The pretreatment requirements for waste solids will be determined based on benefit to the processing mission. This treatment will range from: simple solid-liquid separators to; oxidative leaching to remove chromium and caustic leaching to remove aluminum followed by solid-liquid separation. The degree of solids-liquid separation will impact the amount of interstitial soluble components such as sodium. There is also a need to understand the impacts on HLW melter performance and throughput of these HLW compositions.</p>
<p>Hanford HLW inventory information will be reviewed to select a HLW stream with high plutonium content. The impacts of the increased supernate content and lower solids content in this feed option will be investigated in this task. A series of waste compositions and solids contents will be investigated that span the range of washing efficiencies between the baseline WTP full-wash option and the no-wash option. A series of crucible melts will be formulated and tested to investigate the effects on glass compositions and waste loadings. Based on those results, a range of wash options will be selected with ORP for subsequent testing on the DM100 melter system. These tests will assess the impacts on processability and melt rates as well as the need for redox control resulting from the higher levels of nitrates from the increased supernate fraction. Off-gas data will be collected to assess off-gas carryover and the potential impacts of increased NOx generation on the WTP HLW facility, which, unlike the WTP LAW facility, does not include an SCR NOx removal system. In addition, the ability of increased bubbling to compensate for the increased evaporative load will be investigated. One of the objectives will be to determine the extent to which the shortfall in feed solids content can be compensated by improved HLW melter bubbling.<br /><br />CLIN 0017: Effect of Feed Solids Content on LAW Melt Processing<br />Although the baseline LAW melter feeds have relatively high solids content, it is likely that LAW glass production rates could be increased if the solids content in melter feeds could be increased. The limitation in the present WTP baseline derives from the potential effects of higher solids on the rheological properties of the melter feeds and the need for compatibility with the WTP feed mixing and transport systems. This is accomplished essentially by designing the melter feeds such that they all have similar solids contents and glass yields. Accordingly, melter feed for a LAW stream with high waste loading that requires less glass former additives will be prepared with a more concentrated waste, whereas a LAW stream with lower waste loading and more glass former additives will be prepared with a less concentrated waste. The required waste concentration for each LAW stream is, therefore, defined based on the waste loading. Thus, there is a need to determine the impact of increased solids content on LAW glass production rates and potential methods of compensating for the resulting changes in feed rheology. <br />In addition, under the need to fully understand the spectrum of LAW feeds, it is possible that the LAW feeds to the vitrification facility will have lower concentrations than those projected under the present baseline. In this LAW feed processing flexibility, LAW is fed to the vitrification facility with minimal in-tank or near-tank pretreatment, which will likely involve ion-exchange and solids removal. Without the capability for evaporation, some feeds to the vitrification facility will be delivered at much lower than design concentrations. This can lead to issues such as feed settling and lower processing rate. Thus there is also a need to investigate the effects of lower feed solids contents. <br />In this task, tests will be conducted on the DM100 melter system over a range of solids contents, both above and below the nominal, to assess the effects on glass production rates and melter operations. Tests will also be conducted to adjust the rheology of both highly concentrated and very dilute feeds using rheology modifiers and/or particle size adjustments so that the feeds have rheological properties within the WTP bounds. Steady-state production rates for the feeds at different solids contents will be determined so that the glass production rate at a specified solids content can be estimated. These data will be valuable in planning feed for the LAW flow-sheet for the WTP and for the assessment of potential LAW throughput enhancements.</p>

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8pt">While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical, and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</span></p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), with Motorola Solutions, Inc., ("Motorola") U.S. Federal Government Markets Division, 7031 Columbia Gateway Drive, 3rd Floor, Columbia, MD 21046, under RFQPR2080.

Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

The FBI's LMR infrastructure employs a unique encoding design proprietary to Motorola. The FBI uses Motorola equipment spanning several generations for its radio system communications that requires hybrid components also unique to the LMR infrastructure and includes Motorola's proprietary encoding design. Motorola Solutions, Inc. will upgrade and perform maintenance and repair FBI owned existing LMR infrastructure equipment to include all types and generations of Motorola Solutions, Inc. equipment.</span></p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to <br />be incorrect information within the meaning of the ``Suspension of Payment'' paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-<br />(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

As used in this clause- <br>  <br>  quote mark Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number quote mark  means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors. <br>  <br>  quote mark Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number quote mark  means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern. <br>  <br>  quote mark Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database quote mark  means that- <br>  <br> (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database; <br>  <br> (2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database; <br>  <br> (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br>  <br> (c) <br> (1) <br> (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- <br>  <br> (A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br>  <br> (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and <br>  <br> (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the  quote mark Suspension of Payment quote mark  paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br>  <br> (3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun & Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer.

As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to award a firm-fixed price contract on a non-competitive basis with IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-On Industrial of Kenosha, WI for common hand tools and toolboxes for the JSF Tool Control Program, necessary to support the Joint Strike Fighter Program Office (JSFPO) LRIP7 program. Since 2011, IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial has had a five year exclusive agreement with Lockheed Martin, the OEM for the JSF, for the JSF tools and toolboxes, and continue to work closely with the Lockheed Martin procurement and tool management personnel. IDSC Holdings, LLC Snap-on Industrial independently developed and created the Design Control Activity for this program. The required tools and toolboxes have been previously designed and purchased by the JSF program at the squadron level, however, the JSF program did not procure the data to compete this requirement. Each specific tool and toolbox is designed to accomplish a specific maintenance task on the JSF aircraft. The toolboxes are fitted with foam inserts into which the exact designs of the required tools are etched. This provides the fleet with the capability of ensuring that all the tools are accounted for upon completion of the maintenance tasks. Further, training is conducted utilizing these identical tool and toolbox kits. In order to ensure that all servicemen trained on servicing the JSF aircraft and equipment can perform their designated tasks no matter where they are located. JSF tools are the same from one squadron to another. Should another manufacture provide the tools to be procured, the requirement will then exist to re-cut the foam insert for the tool which is a costly procedure which will not be recouped through competition. Furthermore, there would then be inconsistency from one squadron to another in the type of tools utilized for each task and would present a logistics problem should replacement ever be necessary. IDSC Holdings LLC, Snap-On Industrial tools and toolboxes are essential to satisfy the agency need. IDSC Holdings LLC, Snap-On Industrial is the only source available today to meet the programs requirement.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above item under the authority of 10 USC 3204 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not to request for competitive proposals: however the Government will consider all responses received to this notice. A determination by the Government, not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received within fifteen (15) days of publication of this notice. The Point of Contact is Mr. Rhondi Bates, Rhondi.bates@navy.mil, (732) 323-4832.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address: <br />Contracts Department<br />Hwy. 547 Attn:B562-3C<br />Lakehurst, New Jersey 08733-5083 <br />Primary Point of Contact.: <br />Mr. Rhondi Bates<br />rhondi.bates@navy.mil<br />Phone: 7323234832</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [X], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New or in good condition- initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Monthly delivery for one year. <BR> <BR>(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as ?brand name or equal,? the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government?s needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that ?equal? products must meet are specified in the solicitation. (b) To be considered for award, offers of ?equal? products, including ?equal? products of the brand name manufacturer, must? (1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; (2) Clearly identify the item by? (i) Brand name, if any; and (ii) Make or model number; (3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and (4) Clearly describe any modifications the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modifications. (c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate ?equal? products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. (d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an ?equal? product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation. <BR> <BR>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK: TELECONFERENCING/VIDEOCONFERENCING SUPPORT SERVICES</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Scientific Review Program (SRP) at the NIH NIAID conducts the peer review of grants and contracts that are submitted for funding. No grant or R and D contract gets funded at the NIH without first being peer reviewed. We recruit experts from around the world to review approximately 1800 grant and contract proposals each year. For many years the standard was to bring these reviewers to the Washington DC area for face to face meetings. In past years we have been decreasing the number of face to face meetings and increasing the number of teleconference/videoconference meetings. This has increased our reliance on reliable teleconference/videoconference service providers. In 2012, SRP conducted approximately 320 digital conferences including participants from around the world. The total meeting minutes comprised approximately 50,000 minutes and we expect to use the same number of minutes during the 2014 performance period.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is Request for Quotation (RFQ) HSCG23-14-Q-AFR404. This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-71. The solicitation does not have a Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAP) rating.</p>
<p>In preparation to meet the training requirements for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Fast Response Cutters (FRC), USCG desires to purchase one (1) frame for the Propulsion Control Console (PCC). The PCC frame will provide a means of housing and mounting the entire 5th generation Monitoring Control System (MCS-5) and the 5th generation Remote Control System (RCS-5) system components. The PCC will emulate the configuration of the actual FRC bridge console, providing the students a realistic and enriched training environment.</p>
<p>The PCC will be used in the training program that directly supports maintenance and operations of the electronic Propulsion Control Systems installed aboard Coast Guard WPC class cutters.</p>
<p>The PCC frame will consist of a four-bay assembly fabricated from 5052-H32 Aluminum. The assembly will be modular in four sections to facilitate installation in new training building and movement through standard door openings. The four sections will be bolted together using stainless steel hardware. Please see the attachment entitled "Picture of the FRC PCC Frame" for an example of how sections can be bolted together.</p>
<p>The support frames for each section will be made from formed aluminum (.125") with slots to support an adjustable shelf in each section, as well as other electronic support items to be installed later. Frames will support cover plates and hinged panels (.125") using stainless steel for all hardware and fasteners. Assembly will be powder coated RAL 3011 color, matte finished fine texture.</p>
<p>The hinged panels (Sections A-D) will have provisions to lock in the vertical position, should be pinned to allow removal of the entire panel, and be capable of free movement in degree indicated on drawing with 25 pounds attached. Front and Rear access panels on each section shall be attached using 1/4-turn fasteners for quick access. The rear upper panel on each section will be louvered to facilitate venting of electronic components. Please see the attachments entitled "Picture of the FRC PCC Frame" and "Drawing of the FRC PCC Frame" for additional details.</p>
<p>Within 45 days after contract award, the contractor-built frame shall be shipped and have arrived at the USCG Training Center in Yorktown, VA, where the MTU electronic control components will be installed.

Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>

<DESC>This notice is for planning purposes only. A project award will not be awarded from this announcement. The Government intends to release an Interim Annual Plan for execution of a project award(s) in support of Ground Robotics related research areas. The purpose of this announcement is to provide members of the Robotics Technology Consortium, and industry in general, advanced notification of Government intent.  <br>    <br>  In December 2007, the Government announced its intent to enter into an Other Transaction Agreement with one (1) consortium in support of Ground Robotics related Research and Development projects. As a result of the Ground Robotics Industry Day in January 2008, one (1) consortium formed, the Robotics Technology Consortium. It is the intent of the Government to make multiple project awards to the members of the Robotics Technology Consortium as a result of member project proposals submitted via the Request for Project Proposals.  <br>    <br>  The anticipated three (3) research areas for which white papers and project proposals will be sought are the following: (1) Autonomy; (2) Platform; (3) Capabilities & Usage. The Interim Annual Plan (W15QKN-08-9-0001-iAP_14.1) will be issued to the Robotics Technology Consortium's Administrative Agent, the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, who will then issue the request to the members of the consortium. For information on the Robotics Technology Consortium and/or how to become a member, visit the following website: http://www.roboticstechc.org/.

<DESC>Army Contracting Command-Warren plans to issue a sole source solicitation pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, to BAE Systems Land & Armaments, L.P. (BAE Systems) for the Conversion of Bradley M3A3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) into the Bradley M2A3 Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) for a total quantity of up to 150 vehicle conversions.  It is the Government's intent to award the initial base quantity of 70 vehicle conversions as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) letter contract with BAE Systems (cage # 06085). It is also the Government's intent to separately issue a sole source solicitation for the additional option quantities of 80 conversion vehicles.  The letter contract would allow for a quantity of 70 conversion vehicles with the remaining 80 conversion vehicles separately solicited and negotiated into the definitized contract.  The purpose of this acquisition is for the repair and conversion of Bradley vehicles from the M3A3 to the M2A3 configuration.  These converted vehicles will support the digitization of the Combat Engineer vehicles as directed in the recent Army Force Structure redesign and the removal of the analog Operation Desert Storm (ODS) configuration engineer vehicles from Bradley A3 units.  The conversion of the vehicles from the M3A3 to M2A3 configuration will also modify the interior stowage capabilities, periscope locations, and ramp configuration, and increase the number of squad seats.  This effort is synopsized to notify of potential subcontracting opportunities as required by FAR 5.201(c).

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt">Synopsis:<br /><br />The F-16 Wing and Maintenance Support Project is posting a synopsis with an attachment of NSNs to allow vendors the opportunity to view the NSN list and the Annual Demand Quantities (ADQs) for the OO-ALC customer and for the World Wide Support. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Adjustments in the concept of operations are in process, therefore, it is anticipated that the RFP will post in the next 30-60 days. <br /><br />The following information is the current support needed and will not change:<br /><br />1. The item is 100% Small Business Set Aside<br /><br />2. The scope of this requirement includes delivery of NSNs and the engineering required to deliver solutions for material obsolescence and diminishing sources of supply issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt">3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The prime contractor will be required to demonstrate that they possess or real-time or near real-time access to F-16 technical information and engineering expertise to deliver solutions for material obsolescence and diminishing sources of supply issues and present those solutions to the Government for final approval.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed solutions will include supporting documentation, drawing changes, and test results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The small business prime contractor must provide 51% of the contract support.<br /><br />4. Each NSN will have&nbsp;a dual delivery channel, in that, there will direct supply to the OO-ALC depot maintenance operations and world-wide (operational units) supply via DLA wholesale inventory. The NSNs will have a specific ADQ for the OO-ALC&nbsp;customer and will have a specific ADQ for the World Wide DLA support.&nbsp;<br /><br />5. OO-ALC will have specialized customer service, and delivery requirements that will require the contractor to forecast requirements and hold some level of inventory to successfully meet contract requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DLA will maintain management, forecasting, and wholesale inventory for requirements supporting DLA Direct Operation customers. <br /><br />6. An over above CLIN will be included in the contract to cover non-recurring costs for remedying material obsolescence issues.<br /><br />7. The purpose of the NSN list on Tab 1 and Ampl on Tab 2 is allow the suppliers to initiate estimates for the sole source items that may take longer and to begin developing relationships with subcontractors.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 7.5pt">8. The Contract is expected to have a 5 year base period and a single 3-year option. Pricing for all eight years is expected to be provided at the time of proposal submission. </span></p>

<DESC>I have attached the second set of questions. Please let me know if i have missed any questions. Tomorrow is the last day to submit a question. I will issue an amendment that corrects a few thing from some of the Q&amp;A's. This will be cosmetic only and should not change the proposal submission. An example of the amendment is to add the building number to section C. Or to make some corrections that were pointed out from the Q&amp;A's. This should be complete on Thursday once i see if there are any other questions.

<DESC>These are the last of the questions&nbsp;i recieved. I have decided not to issue a third amendment since the correcttions do not changes are not major and will not affect form for price of the&nbsp;proposal. All of the&nbsp;Q&amp;A's have the corrections as needed. <br /><br />&nbsp;
<p>1&nbsp;) Amendment 0001 to subject solicitation extended the due date to 30 September 2013. Please verify the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>time for submission is "No Later Than 3 P.M. EDT, 30 September 2013."<br /><br />Answer: That is correct<br /><br />2) Attachment SPE4A513R03970001.0002 provided with the amendment documents, contained two tabs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Our assumption is the tab called "sheet 1" is the one we should input our FA pricing on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Could you please confirm that this is the case and that we should ignore the tab called "query1"?</p>
<p>Answer: SPE4A513R03970001.0002.xls this is title of the fat prices spreadsheet, it is under the amendment.</p>
<p>3) Paragraph L.5 of the RFP states that the 4 pricing spreadsheets (309th unit pricing, Operational Customer unit pricing, FAT pricing, Surge and Sustainment pricing) must be submit via email to Veronica Salazar in addition to the CD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was confirmed in yesterday's Q&amp;A's that only a CD was required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do we still need to email the pricing spreadsheets?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If so, does section L.2 on the RFP apply?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Do we need to send it as an encrypted message or is regular email acceptable?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Answer: Yes send an electronic copy, if you are comfortable without a digital signature I am too, no one else can get into my computer.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

The ENs issued require a clear answer. A decision to review the EN responses in a Source Selection format will be made once the EN answers are received. The intent of the contracting officer is to move forward to close negotiations after the responses are received. Should the responses need further negotiations as determined by the pricing or tech teams, Round 2 of ENs will be issued to continue negotiations. After satisfactory responses are received, and approval has been granted, a request for Final Proposal Revisions will be requested.<br /><br /><br />Question 2: Do the pricing spreadsheets count towards the page limits and if so, to what extent?<br /><br />Answer: The pricing spreadsheets should be submitted in the same format that they were solicted with the RFP. <br /><br /><br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Question 3: EN A-10 states that we "are requested to meet the Government's solicited delivery objective for Operational Customer."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /><br />Answer: The intent of this statement is to negotiate the Operationl customer PLT to the solicted PLT. </span></span>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation for the procurement of approximately thirty-three (33) Low Profile Photonics Masts (LPPMs). Requirements will include LPPM development, production, spares procurement and engineering/technical services (150,000 hours). NAVSEA intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 27, 2013. Proposals will be due sixty days after issuance of the RFP. LPPM features shall include visual imaging, infrared imaging, laser range finding, special stealth features and a capable antenna suite with broad spectral coverage and direction finding functions contained within a physically small housing. The systems are required to have the capability to be integrated and interoperable with the Universal Modular Mast (UMM) and diploop assembly as well as below decks AN/BVY-1 and AN/BLQ-10 hardware/software for the applicable platforms. This contract is intended to be awarded as a base plus four option years. In the base year of the contract the successful offeror will complete LPPM design and development. LPPM First Article will be awarded if funds are available. In the first option, the contractor will procure Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) materials for eight Virginia Class new construction LPPM systems. Each of the four options contain two Virginia Class new construction LPPM systems. Full funding for the new construction systems will be provided using optional sub-contract line item numbers to be exercised during the contract&acirc;&euro;&trade;s four option years. The contract will include pre-priced options for modernization kits, spares, and diploops that may be exercised during the course of contract execution. An orders line will be used to procure additional mast systems, spares, dip loops, electronic warfare imaging components and repairable parts associated with the contract. The RFP and related files listed under solicitation number N00024-13-R-6280 will be issued electronically. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it after issuance by accessing the following internet address: http://www.neco.navy.mil. The performance specification and other related controlled files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance. To gain access, prospective offerors must submit a written request via email to the PCO representative, Ms. Karen Giunta (Karen.Giunta@navy.mil). The written request must include the Company Name, Business Address, Classified Address, Commercial Activity and Government Entity Code, Data Universal Numbering System Code and the POC (Name, Title, and phone number of Employee(s) Responsible for the Data). The written request may be submitted prior to the RFP release to obtain security verification and approval. The contractor will receive correspondence confirming eligibility or denial to this data package. Navy policy does not support the release of the performance specification and other related controlled files to non-U.S. contractors. In the event the Navy issues a solicitation for procurement of Low Profile Photonics Mast, only U.S. companies may propose as prime contractors. If a non-U.S. company decides to team with a U.S. prime contractor then the U.S. prime contractor must comply with the Department of State 22CFR Parts 120-130 and submit a request for an export license. DFARS 252.204-7004 ALT A, required Central Contractor Registration applies. Lack of current registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information may be obtained via the internet at www.ccr.gov or via telephone at 888-227-2423. The Government will consider all comments received on the RFP. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comment or question. All such questions should be received in writing within seven (7) days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses to all Offerors prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals. The subsequent revision to any specification or RFP based on comments received remains solely at the Government&acirc;&euro;&trade;s discretion. No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified in this synopsis. This is not an RFP. This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind. This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract. The Government is not responsible for any cost incurred by Industry in responding to this notice. Any comments and/or questions regarding this pre-solicitation notice must be submitted to Karen Giunta via email at Karen.giunta@navy.mil.

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO PRE-SOLICIATION NOTICE:
Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Task Order for Vocus Software Subscription in Support of U.S. EPA/OAM/OEAEE
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), on behalf of the Office External Affairs and Environmental Education (OEAEE), intends to issue a firm-fixed-price task order on a sole source basis with Vocus, Inc. (Vocus) of 4296 Forbes Boulevard, Lanham Seabrook, MD 20706, against Vocus? General Services Administration schedule contract number GS-35F-0668S.  The task order will be processed under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B).  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  Vocus the only source capable of providing the requisite subscription services to EPA?s public relations and government relations software (see below for an extended description of services) since Vocus does not license the software for resale by other vendors.  Additionally, the software subscr iption is the only item that meets EPA?s need.
Description of Requirement:  The EPA has a requirement for integrated, web-based public relations software, hosted via a secure website, with the following capabilities: (1) ability to build, manage and track relationships with the media, including distribution and press inquiry capabilities; (2) access to and regular maintenance of a media database which provides complete contact information and background on various news media which tracks EPA contacts with them; (3) ability to turn news reports into easily distributed reports; (4) ability to identify and pursue media opportunities relevant to EPA and the environmental industry through editorial calendars; (5) ability to send emails with action steps and materials to a targeted audience and view and measure results; (6) graphical reporting tools that tie together news and related activities on a real-time basis, representing them in a customized view which can be tailored for different groups of users; (7) ability to build,  manage, and track relationships with Members of Congress and state legislators, including distribution of information; and (8) access to and regular maintenance of a Government relations database which provides complete contact information, including staff directories, and tracks EPA contacts with them.
For this requirement, the EPA needs access to public relations and Government relations software for 25 concurrent users, which must include the following additional features: News on Demand with premium content, Advanced Analytics with Prominence and Scoring, unlimited email campaigns, ability for interested parties to sign up to receive content on a general and/or specific criteria, and five (5) gigabytes of additional storage.
EPA has determined that Vocus software has features essential to the EPA?s requirements described above.  With its Public Relations Enterprise system and its Government relations system, Vocus is considered the only vendor capable of providing an integrated public relations and Government relations system that includes media inquiries, press call management, federal and state legislator call management, complete news archiving from EPA selected sources and analytics in a single software system.  Additionally, market research indicates similar products offered by vendors other than Vocus do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the EPA?s need.
This requirement is currently being provided by Vocus under task order number EP08H002535, which was awarded on a sole source basis to Vocus under GSA contract GS-35F-0668S on 29 September 2008.  The current task order is due to expire on 31 December 2013.  The EPA expects to extend the performance period end date of this task order by a few months to allow enough time to award a new task order.  This time extension has yet to take place.
THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE TASK ORDER UNDER THE REFERENCED GSA CONTRACT.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSAL.  NO SOLICITATION FOR THE SOLE SOURCE TASK ORDER WILL BE PROVIDED.  The determination not to compete this proposed contract action is solely in the discretion of the EPA.  The EPA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice.  This notice in no way obligates the EPA to award a sole source task order to Vocus.
Interested parties must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill this requirement no later than Wednesday, 19 December 2013 by 10:00 AM ET to Stefan Martiyan, Contracting Officer, via email at martiyan.stefan@epa.gov.  A work statement will not be provided.  Responses to this notice must demonstrate evidence that clearly and convincingly demonstrate that competition of the proposed contract action is appropriate and would be advantageous to the Government.
END OF AMENDMENT.
AMENDMENT TO PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE:
THIS NOTICE IS HEREBY CANCELLED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  ANY/ALL SUBMISSIONS IN RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE WILL NOT BE REVIEWED AT THIS TIME.

Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Task Order for Vocus Software Subscription in Support of U.S. EPA/OAM/OEAEE

<DESC>The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) requires the services of a geotechnical engineering firm to provide Architect/Engineer (AE) design services for the reclamation of hazardous abandoned coal mine areas.  The hazards at the abandoned coal mine sites primarily consist of open shafts and portals, mine subsidence, venting mine gases, and mine drainage.  Other hazards may include mine fires, mine facilities, mine waste piles, and unstable high walls.  Emergency hazards, such as the sudden collapse of shafts, portals, or mine workings, will also require design services under this Scope of Work (SOW).
Generally, the engineering work will include site investigations; exploratory drilling or excavation; sampling and analysis of mine gases and mine drainage; surveys and development of site maps; development of reclamation design alternatives; design development for the selected alternative; identification of environmental effects of the proposed construction; technical support for obtaining environmental permits; preparation of construction specifications and plans; construction cost estimating; participation in public, pre bid, and pre construction meetings; monitoring of construction activities; preparation of reports for the various tasks completed; and other work elements as specified in the Delivery Orders.  Each Delivery Order will specify the work elements to be completed for each project site.

Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 09 - 249 - Murfreesboro, TN intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 09 - 249 - Murfreesboro, TN is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<AWARDEE>Kimball International, Inc., 1600 ROYAL ST, Jasper, IN 47549-0001 US
<DESC>This action procured office furniture in support of Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) AIR 5.1.7 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) VX23, Building 2780 at Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, MD. This procurement requires the delivery of forty-three (43) Kimball workstations with seating, filing, storage, and conferencing. This includes the procurement of the office furniture products, as well as design verification and installation services. This procurement will be awarded on the Navy-wide Office Furniture multiple-award BPA.
<p>As a result of a Department of Navy (DoN) strategic sourcing initiative dated 26 September 2011, the Navy made the decision to establish a multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement to procure furniture products, in order to leverage the buying power available through GSA. FISC Norfolk was recruited to award the $120 million multiple-award BPA. A total of 74 vendors were awarded BPAs in the September-October 2007 timeframe. The Spiral II BPAs were awarded in the May-June 2011 timeframe and became effective 01 June 2011. Kimball International, Inc was awarded BPA N00189-11-A-0100 in April 2011.</p>
<p>This effort is sole source procurement as authorized by Reference (c) and FAR 8.405-6, with Kimball International Inc, a vendor on the FISC Office Furniture BPA. Jerrell Design Group is the local distributor for Kimball International, Inc. JSF VX23 is modifying existing cubicle workstations to accommodate additional personnel. New workstations will be fully integrated with existing workstations; therefore it is essential that the new networked office system components are fully compatible with existing components. The existing furniture brand is Kimball, and no other brands are compatible with Kimball's furniture. The total cost of the procurement which includes material, installation, and design services was $239,332.96. Contract N00189-11-A-0100-M801 was awarded to Kimball International, Inc. on 27 November 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />V. DEMONSTR TlON THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITIY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p><br />At this time, Honeywell Div.

The applicable RMSC B. This part must be repaired by a source(s) specified on a<br />source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of ASME Tl4.1 00, Engineering Drawing and Related Documentation Practices, Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing<br />knowledge is not available to permit repair by other sources. Although, by ASME T 14.

Without this data, which this contractor will not provide to the government, there appears to be no potential for competition for this requirement. Data is proprietary to Honeywell Div. Aerospace.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY,<br />NAVAL MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMMAND<br />LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION
<p><br />1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), acting on behalf of Naval Hospital Yokosuka, intends to award a delivery order against Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract V797P-4237B, pursuant to the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACT ACTION: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program (Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies). This is a limited source action to be awarded as a new FSS delivery order. The placement of a firm, fixed price delivery order is anticipated.</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF REQUIRED SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The proposed acquisition is for an Automated Medication Dispensing System provided by ScriptPro USA Inc., 5828 Reeds Rd, Mission, KS 66202.</p>
<p>The requirement is for one (1) robotic medication dispensing system for Naval Hospital Yokosuka. System shall incorporate a workflow system using robotics for medication dispensing, manual prescription filling, prescription imaging, checking, filling and verification of all medications dispensed. Solutions shall be designed to prevent medication dispensing errors during prescription fulfillment and cross-contamination of products during dispensing.</p>
<p>System shall be directed and controlled by a workflow management system (WFMS). System shall provide role-based security such that an operator's tasks/access shall be limited to only the tasks/access they are authorized for. Unit shall utilize a method of scanning as a means of medication and patient verification throughout the dispensing process including the robotic medication dispensing, manual filling stations, PV stations and the issuing windows.</p>
<p>System shall provide imaging capability for drug products. An image database shall be provided that shall be capable of displaying an image of the dispensed drug at the various workstations. For tablets, an image of two sides of the tablet shall be displayed and for unit of use items, an image of the manufacturer's package shall be displayed. Solution shall be capable of handling hardcopy prescriptions presented for fulfillment.</p>
<p>System shall include robotic medication dispensing unit(s) that can automatically select a prescription vial of the proper size, fill the vial with the proper medication, and print and apply the correct prescription label directly to the filled vial. The prescription label shall include standard prescription information, a bar code, and USP auxiliary label information. Solutions shall use bar codes to confirm correct drug product and strength. Vials shall be filled directly from drug dispensing cells to prevent cross-contamination. The vial shall be collated for the pharmacist to perform a final verification.</p>
<p>Robotic medication dispensing unit shall have drug dispensing cells that can be cleaned and calibrated onsite by pharmacy technicians when changing the medication dispensed by the individual cells. Proposed unit shall not require dispensing cells to be shipped offsite for cleaning and calibration prior to use with a new medication. Proposed unit shall allow for two separate vial sizes to be loaded into the system at once. Robotic medical dispensing unit shall be capable of dispensing C3-5 control drugs. Proposed unit shall have a method of locking to limit access and audit tracking of such dispensing cell.</p>
<p>Solution shall include manual workstations to allow for manual filling of medications, prescription imaging, input/dispensing, checking and verification. Each workstation shall include equipment necessary to perform its function and to operate with the workflow management system (WFMS). Such equipment may include but is not limited to barcode scanners, computers, monitors, prescription label/paperwork printers, image scanners or other equipment as required for system to operate as intended.</p>
<p>At manual filling stations, solution shall confirm that the medication is the correct formula and dosage as on the order. The patient-specific prescription label should not be released until such confirmation is completed. Solution shall utilize a method to verify an order is correct, complete, and ready to be issued to the patient.</p>
<p>Solution shall include servers/software licenses necessary to allow the system to operate as specified. Solution shall operate on Windows 7 operating system and comply with Navy Information Assurance requirements. Vendor shall provide installation of solution at Naval Hospital Yokosuka. Vendor shall be able to provide on-island support for the system. The electrical requirement for the system is 107VAC, 50Hz.</p>
<p>Vendor shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.<br />Upon delivery, the vendor shall be responsible for uncrating the unit/system, transporting it through the facility to the location of intended use for installation, and removing of all trash created in this process. If interim storage is required, the vendor shall make arrangements for the storage.<br />The system shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The system shall be installed in compliance with OSHA requirements.</p>
<p><br />4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE AND/OR DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS: The statutory authority which permits restricting consideration of schedule contractors to fewer than that required in FAR 8.405-1 is 41 U.S.C. 251, as implemented by FAR 8.405-6(b)(1) - only one source is capable of responding.</p>
<p>ScriptPro USA Inc. is the only vendor on the federal supply schedule that can provide an outpatient medication dispensing system to Naval Hospital Yokosuka and provide on-island support to the hospital after the unit is in place. No other vendor on the federal supply schedule can provide an outpatient medication dispensing system to Naval Hospital Yokosuka and provide on-island support after the unit is installed. As the robotic medication dispensing system will provide the majority prescription fulfillment, any downtime due to system failure would result in significant negative impact to the Pharmacy's ability to meet its mission. Only ScriptPro USA Inc. can provide the necessary equipment and support to meet the minimum requirements of the government.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE: A determination will be made by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d). The FSS pricing, along with the contractor's ability to meet our delivery terms will represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH: Market research was conducted in the beginning of October 2013. Search of Federal Supply Schedules identified that no other vendor can meet the minimum requirements of the government. Other vendors were identified that can provide outpatient medication dispensing systems: Parata and Amerisource Bergen. Parata cannot provide on-island support to a unit at Naval Hospital Yokosuka. Amerisource Bergen was contacted and does not sell units or support automated medication dispensing units in Japan. ScriptPro USA Inc. is the only vendor available that can provide a system and support needed after the unit is installed at Naval Hospital Yokosuka.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: None <br /><br />8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION: As the barriers that preclude the agency from the requirements of section 8.405-1 are due to limited vendors on schedule, no actions can be taken by this agency to remove those barriers. If additional vendors are added to the FSS for this equipment, they will be considered as applicable.</p>
