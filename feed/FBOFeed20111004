<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend contract NNA06AA01C with Consolidated Safety Services,Inc., on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One ResponsibleSource. The performance period will be extended for a potential ten month period,consisting of a seven-month base period and three one-month options. The principle purpose of this cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is to provide occupationalsafety support, industrial hygiene support, health physics support, construction safetyengineering support, fire protection engineering support, Voluntary Protection Program(VPP) support, safety training, Health Unit operations, Fitness Center operations, andEmergency Response support to NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). The required servicessupport various programs that assure ARC operations are carried out in compliance withapplicable Federal, State, and local regulations and NASA policies, protect the safetyand health of all employees at ARC, and maintain and retain ARC's OSHA VPP certificationand Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations certification. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA06AA01C,for seven (7) months, from October 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012 for the base period; andend on August 31, 2012 if all three one-month options are exercised.  The requiredservices are currently under re-competition. The anticipated award date for the follow-oncontract is April 9, 2012. The current contractor, Consolidated Safety Services, Inc., isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension. Award to another source during evaluation phase of there-competition effort would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Governmentthat is not expected to be recovered through competition of the extension and would notallow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting the continuity of services andcausing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements. The extension is theGovernments best interest to provide ongoing Occupational Safety, Industrial Hygiene,and Medical services until a new contract is awarded. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on requirement. Information regardingthe recompetition of the Safety, Environmental and Medical Support Services (SEMSS) canbe found at the following website:http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/doing_business/index.php?apt&rid=196	The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon October 11, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Under the authority of Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5205.15E and the authority vested in the Secretary of Defense by 10 USC 113, the DoD announces the Department of Defense Forensic Research and Development Program. The program is executed under the policy and guidance of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (Defense Biometrics and Forensics Office) and administered by the US Army Research Office (ARO) and the US Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL). The DoD Directive 5205.15E establishes policy and assigns responsibilities within the DoD to develop and maintain an enduring, holistic, global forensic capability to support the full range of military operations (ROMO). The Defense Forensic Enterprise (DFE) consists of those DoD resources, assets, and processes that provide forensic science analysis linking persons, places, things, and events. These linkages are made in both traditional law enforcement and medical purviews, as well as in the expeditionary environment. Additionally, DoD Directive 5205.15E designates the Secretary of the Army as the DoD Executive Agent (EA) for Forensics for those forensic disciplines relating to DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), serology, firearms and tool marks, latent prints, questioned documents, drug chemistry, and trace materials, as well as forensics relating to medical disciplines such as forensic pathology, forensic anthropology, forensic toxicology, and DNA analysis to identify human remains. Proposals that will assist the Army in achieving these goals are solicited, particularly proposals involving the development of equipment that is portable, sustainable, and useful in an expeditionary environment. The expeditionary environment requires systems that are lightweight, portable, inexpensive, fast, and capable of operating in extreme environments of temperature, dust, humidity, etc. The systems must also be capable of secure data communications. <br><br>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to extend the period of performance (ordering period) on an other than full and open competition basis on contract N68936-07-D-0005 with Epsilon Systems Solutions, 1565 Hotel Circle South, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92108-3418.  An extension to the period of performance on contract N68936-07-D-0005 is necessary to provide continuation of services during the time it will take to award the follow-on contract.  The action will result in an extension to the period of performance for an additional nine months.  The total estimated hours for the extension is 38,900 hours.  This sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The contract extension is for continuation of services necessary to conduct environmental surveys and studies support consisting of conducting nature, cultural, pollution prevention, and geophysical resource-specific surveys, studies, analyses, environmental planning and documentation in the Western Mojave/Great Basin/California desert regions, and the Southern California Channel Island coastal areas.
  Epsilon Systems Solutions is the current contractor providing effort under this contract. They have the required workforce, expertise, experience and are currently working on-going projects. Continued support is mission critical, as all test and facilities support requirements are to be addressed for environmental impacts on a daily and weekly basis. Failure to do so will result in loss of range time and direct operational impacts to supporting the warfighter. Award of the contract modification is expected on or about 28 November 2011 with an effective date of 05 December 2011.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Notes 22 & 26 apply.

The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Aspen Systems, Inc., 184 Cedar Hill St, Marlborough, MA  01752-3017 for services to modify the design, build and test the prototype antenna cooling system and report the results.
  The government also anticipates including an option for the delivery of the cooling system components and the integration and testing of the system.  The basis for the sole source is that Aspen Systems, Inc. has developed the initial design for a prototype system under a previous contract.  As the technology is proprietary to Aspen Systems, it is the only company that can provide the required fabrication and technical support.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Construction Project: Ice Harbor Navlock Downstream Gate Cable Installation II.  This will be a firm-fixed-price contract.  Estimated magnitude of construction is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. The period of performance is approximately 18 days. 100% Performance and payment bonds will be required.<br><br>Summary Scope of Work: Install all new, Government-furnished components as specified for a cable connection to the downstream Navigation Lock Gate and Counter Weight at Ice Harbor Lock & Dam, Burbank, Washington.  Components include, but are not limited to; wire rope, frame work, socket sets, connection rods and fasteners, re-roofing materials for navigation lock towers.  <br><br>The gate is a guillotine type attached to counterweights on either side of the navigation lock.  Removal and installation of wire ropes and attachment assemblies will require the contractor to supply equipment for a combination of shimming and jacking to the counterweight and/or gate.   Each counterweight weights approximately 350 tons and is attached to the gate via 12 wire ropes.  Each rope is 2-1/4" diameter and roughly 150 feet in length.  The contractor will be required to submit a detailed procedure of how the work is to be accomplished.  All supporting elements and installation procedures will require analysis by a Professional Engineer.   <br><br>Upon installation of the wire ropes and socket sets, the contractor must provide the equipment and expertise necessary to determine rope loads and adjust the sockets ensuring loads are equally distributed.  Each wire rope is equipped with two load cells having three sensors per cell.  All load cell sensors (total quantity of 72) on each counterweight must be read simultaneously during the balancing procedure.  The contractor will be required to adjust the weight of the counterweight to ensure a balanced system, which means the weight of each counterweight is equal to half of the gate weight.  Contractor team responsible for load balancing must be led by a professional engineer with at least 5 projects within a 5 year period with experience in load testing, data collection and qualitative analysis of resulting force data for multiple cable supported systems.  The contractor will be required to re-install position limit sensing devices to match the existing range of motion.  All work must be accomplished within  approximately 18 consecutive days which may require day and night shift work.  <br><br>Solicitation Number W912EF-12-R-0003 will be posted to the FBO website on or about October 19, 2011.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify the capabilities of the marketplace of all interested parties, including individuals, academic institutions, businesses, or other public or private agencies. <br /><br />This request is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any future solicitation. No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this will be included on the source list. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.
<p>The FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDA's view of the information received. Do not send any material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or that may be business sensitive. Responses received that include a non-disclosure agreement or identify information that is business sensitive will not be accepted. Responses to this notice will not be returned.</p>
<p><br />Mission and Objectives:</p>
<p>FDA anticipates the need for secondary data analysis on existing topography data sets for use in the development of a risk analysis model of tobacco smoke exposure. This information would provide an appropriate representation of a user's exposure to cigarette smoke in a given day. Ideally measurements are obtained from each cigarette smoked during the day, from the first cigarette of the day to the last cigarette of the day. These data would characterize individual levels of smoke exposure from each cigarette smoked during the course of the day. The information needed includes, but is not limited to:<br />1. Topography distribution for each cigarette user as available (age incl. young adult &lt;25 and adult 26+, gender, weight, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, parameters for cigarette use such as cigarette per day, years smoking, number of cessation attempts and length of attempts, cigarette type such as menthol/nonmenthol, brand and/or subbrand)<br />2. Total number of cigarettes per day with the following measurements for each cigarette:<br />a. Puff duration per puff and total puff duration per cigarette<br />b. Puff volume per puff and total puff volume per cigarette<br />c. Total number of puffs per cigarette<br />d. Inter-puff interval<br />e. Total smoking time per cigarette with and without interpuff intervals<br />f. Time that each puff of smoke is inhaled and held in the lungs (i.e. the puff duration ceases when the draw for that puff ceases but this parameter provides the time from the initiation of the puff to the exhalation of that same puff of smoke or the residence time of the smoke in the user)<br />g. The amount of tobacco used per cigarette<br />h. Data on topography differences in topography for cigarettes smoke through the course of a day (i.e. difference between the first cigarette of the day, cigarettes throughout the day, last cigarette of the day, after abstinence)<br />i. Other methodology information (variable descriptors, timing, etc)<br />3. Data correlating natural exposure to field measured exposure and/or laboratory exposure</p>
<p>RFI Instructions:<br /><br />Please complete Part A, Specification Questionnaire, describing your company's capabilities; Part B, Size of Business and Part C, Estimated Dollar Value Range.</p>
<p>Responses shall be:</p>
<p>&#61656; identified with the RFI number ;<br />&#61656; no more than five (5) pages in length;<br />&#61656; not submit published or unpublished completed analyses;<br />&#61656; Submitted to the email as indicated above.</p>
<p>FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDA's view of the information received.</p>
<p>Part A. Technical Capability</p>
<p>Specification Questionnaire:</p>
<p>1. Do you or your company have access to existing smoking topography datasets? Please describe the types of existing smoking topography datasets you have access to, and how you are able to access the existing datasets.</p>
<p>2. Does your company have the expertise to evaluate the methodology used and interpretation of results (e.g. social scientists, toxicologists)? Please describe the staff expertise in this area.</p>
<p>3. Does your company have the ability to perform secondary data analyses on existing datasets and provide a comprehensive written report, including tables, graphs, output arrays, etc? Please describe your experience with similar projects and the expertise of the staff utilized to perform that work.</p>
<p>4. What restrictions, if any, does your company place on sharing analyses with other government agencies or non-governmental organizations? Please describe the nature of any restriction (e.g., proprietary restrictions).</p>
<p>Part B. Size of Business</p>
<p>State whether your company is a large business, small business (and also state your socioeconomic status), College/University, or is a non-profit organization.</p>
<p>Part C. Estimated Dollar Value Range</p>
<p>Based on the government's mission and objectives, what dollar value range would you determine to be the most accurate rough estimate for the performance of such analyses.</p>
<p>Under $5,000.00</p>
<p>Over $5,000.00 and Under $10,000.00</p>
<p>Over $10,000.00 and Under $20,000.00</p>
<p>Over $20,000.00 and Under $25,000.00</p>

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is seeking information through this Request forInformation (RFI) to identify, improve and/or enhance monopropellant systems forincreasing challenging mission requirements. This document is for information andplanning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness andfeasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.The current state-of-the art in monopropellant thrusters for spacecraft applications useshydrazine fuel that is decomposed by a catalyst bed.  The state-of-the art in catalystused in these thrusters is a packed bed of a porous substrate (alumina) with Iridiumcatalyst.  This catalyst system is subject to a number of difficult-to-controldegradation issues associated with the stability of the substrate.  Examples includemechanical abrasion between bed particles causing catalyst breakup, penetration ofhydrazine into the pores of the catalyst causing catalyst breakup as the bed warms tooperating temperature, and catalyst breakup due to pressure spikes that occur whenhydrazine that collects in voids in the catalyst bed suddenly decomposes.  All of theseprocesses contribute to formation of voids in the catalyst, which then hasten the rate ofbed degradation.For future space missions, NASA is expecting a demand for ever more stringentrequirements for monopropellant thruster performance.  Operating conditions for thesethrusters will be severe, including operation with propellant as cold as 10 C, thousandsof starts in which the catalyst bed is raised from a catalyst bed heater temperature aslow as 100 C to steady temperatures as high as 1400 C, and hundreds of thousands ofpulses in which the catalyst bed stays in the range of 100 C to 400 C.  Total firingstimes are expected to range upwards of 100,000 s.  The pressure within the catalyst bedwill vary from space vacuum to perhaps 30 bar and the flow rate during steady operationmay vary by a factor of 4 or more.  The catalyst bed is expected to have a life ofsuccessful monopropellant activation over 10 to 20 years without degradation.  Althoughthere are several mechanisms by which the catalyst may degrade due to chemicalinstability, these need to be mitigated, and the catalyst bed structural integrity mustalso be able to demonstrate a high degree of mechanical robustness in order to not belost through the severe duty cycles of operation.  NASA GRC is interested in potential catalyst systems that would possess the combinedchemical and mechanical integrity to meet the severe operating conditions describedabove.	This RFI is seeking potential options for such catalyst systems, includingcatalyst, support and configuration that could be investigated for possible candidacy forsuch an application.  A self assessment of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of theproposed system as well as estimated ROM cost and schedule to mature the systems to TRL 6would be of value.  Please provide non-proprietary information only.All inputs must be received by November 23rd, 2011.Interested parties should submit information not to exceed three pages for each concept.Please note that these statements will also be read by non-experts. In the header pleaseinclude the submitting institution, contact person, and RFI title. Information on all monopropellant technologies should be sent, via electronictransmission or by facsimile transmission. This presolicitation synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government,nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents willnot be notified of the results. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over theInternet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may beaccessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRCBusiness Opportunities home page ishttp://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22  It is the offeror'sresponsibility to monitor the Internet cite for the release of the solicitation andamendments (if any).

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research to identify small businesses that can provide onsite support in one or more of the following service areas:?	IT Operations and Security?	IT Services Management?	Infrastructure Architecture and ConfigurationAt this time, SSA is considering awarding one contract for each of the three service areas.  
Please note:  This notice constitutes neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor a pre-solicitation notice.  SSA will neither pay for nor return any information submitted in response to this notice.  SSA will use the results of this market research solely to determine if a small business set aside is appropriate.  
The SOW includes general information about the work, as well as 60 distinct tasks for which SSA requires contractor support.  Please note most tasks require onsite support at SSA Headquarters in Baltimore, MD.  However, certain tasks in the service areas of IT Operations and Security and Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration require onsite support in Durham, NC.
In addition to the SOW, we have posted a spreadsheet that includes the following information:?	Tab 1:  This summary sheet shows the hours expended under each task for the last three years, and whether there has been an overall increase or decrease in the number of hours expended.?	Tab 2:  This summary sheet shows the total number of hours expended per labor category, per task, for the last three years.?	Tabs 3 through 5:  These sheets show a breakdown of the number of hours used by each labor category for each task for years two through four of the existing contract.  It is the basis for the summary sheets found in Tabs 1 and 2.?	Tab 6:  This sheet includes the title of each task.  Additionally, this sheet shows what SSA considers a logical grouping of these tasks into three separate service areas (IT Operations and Security, IT Services Management, and Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration).     The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this acquisition is 541513 (Computer Facilities Management Services).  The size standard associated with this code is $25 million.  
When responding to this notice, please provide the following information:1.	Company Name and Address2.	Name, phone number, and email address of your company?s point of contact (this should be someone who can answer questions about your company?s capabilities)3.

<RESPDATE>101811
<ARCHDATE>12182011
<CONTACT>Lisandra Torres
E-Mail Only
<DESC>Background:
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) requirement for a Nape Protection Pad (NAPP) to be used with Marine Corps combat helmets has increased from 60,000 to 173,000; therefore, an additional 113,000 NAPPs will be procured for initial fielding along with two years of spares to allow for transition of the NAPP to the Defense Logistics Agency for sustainment.  The Marine Corps intent is to procure a total of 147,600 NAPPs; 113,000 to complete initial fielding and 34,600 in spares.

The NAPP provides additional ballistic protection area of coverage to cover a Marines occipital region, an area not covered by any of the helmets in the USMC inventory.  This area contains many critical nervous system components such as the cerebellum, the brain stem, the occipital lobe, and the spinal cord.
  Ground-based and vehicle-based explosives typically expel fragments up and away from the original position of the explosive.  This NAPP increases the ballistic protection area of coverage for Marines.

THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.

Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting market research on interested firms and their capabilities regarding the NAPP.  In response to this request for information, all interested firms should submit a capabilities package that outlines the firms ability to provide a product complying with the stated technical requirements.  The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.

Capabilities Package Content:
1)	Provide background on previous contracts that demonstrate your ability to make ballistic protective items with performance equal to or greater than CO/PD 00-2G.
  The NAPP will be designed in accordance with the Nape Purchase Description (AR/PD 10-01 Rev A) dated 02 June 2011 and Marine Corps Exceptions to the PD.  Both the PD and exceptions documents can be found as attachments to this notice.
2)	State the ability to meet the schedule/manufacturing capability to deliver articles for First Article Testing (FAT) within 120 days after contract award.  After FAT approval, the contractor will be required to produce 4,000 NAPPs per month for the first month and increase production to 10,000 NAPPs per month by the third month.  The capabilities package shall address the contractors ability to meet this production schedule.
3)	Provide unit pricing for the NAPP.
4)	Provide CAGE Code, point of contact information, and business size.
5)	Details demonstrating compliance with 10 U.S.C.
 2533a (Berry Amendment).
The Government intends to release a combined synopsis/solicitation for this requirement during 1st Quarter fiscal year 2012.  At that time, offerors will be required to submit 1) a technical proposal that includes a total of ten (10) Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) consisting of five (5) of each size, thirty-two (32) 15 by 15-inch square shoot pack samples of the proposed ballistic solution, and a written proposal that addresses technical information and discusses the offerors manufacturing capability; and 2) a business proposal that includes pricing and subcontracting information.  Full submittal instructions will be provided in the combined synopsis/solicitation.
  The Government will not return any PDMs, written proposals, the business proposal, nor electronic copies submitted.

Capabilities package shall be received at the following location, no later than 18 October 2011 at 1500 local time.

The IR&amp;D Step 2 is planned for approximately four months after the Step 1 event, and is the opportunity for the industry partners to present their IR&amp;D initiatives to the government team, based on what they learned in the Step 1 workshop. The Step 2 workshop has a one-on-one format where individual companies that participated in the Step 1 will be afforded an opportunity to brief the government team of Subject Matter Experts (SME) on IR&amp;D initiatives selected by the government from all abstract submissions prior to the Step 2 event. Step 3 then becomes the period of assessment and alignment whereby the AF team considers the relevant IR&amp;D programs for Program Objectives Memorandum (POM) planning for mapping into AFRL and ASC strategic plans, and for continuing the dialogue with industry on expediting potential partnerships.</p>
<p>Please note that all ADI conference attendees must either be a Department of Defense (DoD) employee or DoD contractor with a valid DD 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, certification.</p>
<p>This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the government in any way. Attendance at this workshop is voluntary and will not impact any future acquisitions. For complete information on the AFRL IR&amp;D Technology Interchange Workshop, please visit the following website: http://www.wpafb.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5558</p>
<p>IR&amp;D Workshop Format: All government presentations at this Step 1 Workshop will be conducted in a plenary session with all participating companies attending. Note taking will only be allowed on notepads provided at the event. The note pads must be turned in at the end of the event per the security procedures and will be returned to the respective owners after the event. After the plenary session, and if individual participating companies consider necessary, companies can sign up for a Questions-&amp;-Answers (Q&amp;A) session where government SMEs are available to meet with one company at a time to respond to questions they may have. The intent of these sessions is to give companies the opportunity to better understand government needs and be better prepared for participating in Step 2.</p>

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0377<br />Name: Privacy Shield, with Frame, 17.0"<br />Description: The 17" privacy shield with frame will darken the screen from the sides, allowing only the person directly in front of the monitor to view information and preventing onlookers from viewing sensitive data. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0378<br />Name: Privacy Shield, with Frame, 19.0"<br />Description: The 19" privacy shield with frame will darken the screen from the sides, allowing only the person directly in front of the monitor to view information and preventing onlookers from viewing sensitive data. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0389<br />Name: Privacy Shield, with Frame, 22.0" Widescreen<br />Description: The 22" widescreen privacy shield with frame will darken the screen from the sides, allowing only the person directly in front of the monitor to view information and preventing onlookers from viewing sensitive data. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0390<br />Name: Privacy Shield, with Frame, 19.0" Widescreen<br />Description: The 19" widescreen privacy shield with frame will darken the screen from the sides, allowing only the person directly in front of the monitor to view information and preventing onlookers from viewing sensitive data. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0391<br />Name: Privacy Shield, with Frame, 24.0" Widescreen<br />Description: The 24" widescreen privacy shield with frame will darken the screen from the sides, allowing only the person directly in front of the monitor to view information and preventing onlookers from viewing sensitive data. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0377<br />Similar Items: MMMPF317, IVR46412, FEL96893, KTK LCD17SV, CCS 20507</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0378<br />Similar Items: MMMPF319, IVR46413, FEL9689501, KTKLCD19SV, CCS20510</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0389<br />Similar Items: MMMPF322w</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0390<br />Similar Items: MMMPF319w, KTKLCD20WSV</p>
<p>NSN: 7045-00-NIB-0391<br />Similar Items: MMMPF324w</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than October 19, 2011and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition
Identifications;Agency: National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park Sole Source Contractor: Xanterra Parks and Resorts Inc. 
Description of the action: Provide fuel for National Park Service vehicles and boats in the Bridge Bay area. Description of supplies and services: 
The contractor will provide unleaded and diesel fuel for FY1 2  The period to be covered is October 21, 2011 to September 30, 2012 Statutory authority: 41 USC. 253(c) (2); FAR part 6.302-2-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. 
Reason for authority cited: Back in 1992-93, the government fueling station at Bridge Bay Marina was found to be leaking into the ground. At this same time, Xanterra (then TW Services) was in the process of upgrading their existing fueling station tanks to double wall technology, which was mandated by law. In the interest of preserving the lake water, the decision was made by NPS management to remove and clean up the government tank site and not replace them. In the past, credit card purchases were made to cover the cost of fuel. Due to rising fuel costs in recent years, this is no longer a desired method of payment 
Efforts to obtain competition: special notice posted on Fed Biz Ops Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable: Comparison of prices for other commercial services and government estimate. 
Description of the market research conducted: No other provider is located in the marina and none will be allowed by the government 
Other facts supporting other than full & open competition: When the NPS fuel tanks were removed from the Bridge Bay Marina site, the NPS found it to be in the best interest of the government to purchase fuel from the concessionaire, the only fuel available in the area. As Xanterra is the main concessionaire for Yellowstone National Park, there was already an existing contract to provide fuel for the public at the marina. This action also put all responsibility and liability on Xanterra for maintaining the fueling station. This was seen as the best solution both environmentally and financially for Yellowstone Park. No other viable solution is available, as fueling from a delivery truck presents many safety issues. Adding another fueling station to this area, temporary or otherwise is not an option NPS management is not considering at this time. 
lnterested Sources: Xanterra
Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions: No actions are being considered at this time.

<p>The purpose of this Modification 72 is to obligate $54,793.85 in new funding for Option Period 3 in support of Work Assignment 3-103 and to obligate $3,538.15 in new funding to Option Period 2 to pay for trailing invoices.</p>
<p>Work Assignment 3-103 which has an anticipated period of performance of January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. This work assignment is currently funded to the amount of $1,744,169.</p>
<p>Under WA 3-103, the contractor will continue to provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

Tab 1:  This summary sheet shows the hours expended under each task for the last three years and whether there has been an overall increase or decrease in the number of hours expended.?	Tab 2:  This summary sheet shows the total number of hours expended per labor category, per task, for the last three years.?	Tabs 3 through 5:  These sheets show a breakdown of the number of hours used by each labor category for each task for the last three years (years two through four of the existing contract.)  It is the basis for the summary sheets found in Tabs 1 and 2.?	Tab 6:  This sheet includes the title of each task.  Additionally, this sheet shows what SSA considers a logical grouping of these tasks into the three service areas listed above.   At this time, SSA is considering awarding one contract for each of the three service areas.  
Of particular interest to SSA are comments from vendors regarding their ability to provide firm-fixed prices for all or some of the 60 tasks described in the SOW.  Please let us know your opinion on the following:1.	If we were requesting proposals at this time, have we provided enough information for you to submit an offer on a firm-fixed price basis for all of the tasks in any given service area (i.e., could you provide a firm-fixed price for the performance of all of the tasks in the IT Operations and Security area?  For all of the tasks in the IT Services Management area?  For all the tasks in the Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration area?)?  2.	If your answer to question one is ?no,? please explain why.  3.	If your answer to question one is ?no,? do you believe you could propose firm-fixed prices for some but not all of the tasks?  a.	If so, for which could you propose firm-fixed prices?b.	What additional information, if any, would you need to propose firm-fixed prices for all of the tasks?
We are also interested in your opinion on our grouping of the tasks by service area:  are these groupings logical?  Would you have considered different groupings?
Finally, we welcome any other comments you may have on the draft SOW.
Submit your responses to the contract specialist, Nicole Taylor, using FedConnect (if you are not already registered, go to https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/).  If you cannot register in FedConnect, you may email your response to Nicole.D.Taylor@ssa.gov.  Please submit your comments no later than 14 October 2011.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs VA Western NY Healthcare System has a requirement for the Contractor to provide four Micro-Vent 70 cage environmental housing systems for mice with blowers, single exhaust escutcheon plates, iris dampers and variable flow valve setup for thimble exhaust connection and the need to modify 200 cages to add air to the assembly.  Needed also are one 28 cage stainless steel mobile mouse unit for use in quarantine units and two 35-cage stainless steel mobile mouse units for use in animal hosing areas. All caging will have automatic watering which fits with the existing system in the Veterinary Medical Unit.
The system that is in need of replacement due to age and useful life must be compatible with the existing system from Allentown Caging Equipment.   This purchase will replace existing equipment that was determined by Central Office to be in need of replacement due to age and useful life. We will be modifying 200 of our current cages to fit the Micro-Vent Systems to save on cost per unit. These cages will be used in the change out process required twice a week according to Viv11.1 SOP's. We will also be utilizing in-house food hoppers and cage card holders that comply with this system. The other caging units will utilize caging already available in the VMU. A switch to another vendor would require the purchase of 560 cages for units similar to the Micro-Vent, 56 cages for the 28 cage unit and 140 cages for the 35-cage units. Standardization is also required to eliminate the need to purchase similar numbers of food hoppers because hoppers from different vendors are not compatible with different caging systems.  All of the above units are compatible with the automatic watering system in place in the VMU.  This is notice of intent to sole source with Allentown Caging Equipment Co Inc, Route 526, P.O. Box 698, Allentown, NJ  08501-0698. The Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition cited is: 6.302-1(b)(2) 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the existence of compatibility. This is not a request for proposals. NAICS is 332999 and small business size standard is 500 employees. Any questions can be forwarded to Mary.Betker@va.gov

<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.59 per hour or $143.60 per week or $622.27 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>

<p>(2) o Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act.

<p>[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that-</p>

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>

The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is more important than Price****</p>
<p>(End of FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(3) The provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (May 2011) and Alternate 1 (Apr 2011) applies.</p>
<p>(4) The provision at FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jun 2010) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the<br />designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>
<p>(c) If no federal, state or local permits or compliance plans are required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite workplaces, then Contractor shall submit to the designated Port Engineer a letter, notarized under oath, that such documents are not required.<br />(d) Contractors will submit the following to the designated Port<br />Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: Data Sheets (MSDS) documents, certificates, specifications or any other manufacturing data verifying the VOC ratings of paints to be applied to the Cutter in accordance with MLCA Standard Spec 63000N, Section 5.3.1.</p>
<p>REQUIRED INSURANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure and maintain the following kinds of insurance with respect to performance under the contract. In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including:<br />1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4.

<p>The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured.</p>
<p>INSPECTIONS</p>
<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC. <br />DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>
<p>Work Request Process will occur in the following order:<br />1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COTR<br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COTR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Work Request- WR and IGE are generated by the COTR and forwarded to KO<br />4. COTR provides copy of Work Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on WR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COTR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>
<p>(End of FAR 52.212-4 Addendum)</p>
<p>(5) The provision at FAR 52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (May 2011) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>The following FAR Clauses are applicable: <br />52.204-10, Reporting Executive compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (Jul 2010) (Pub. L. 109-282) (31 U.S.C. 6101 note).<br />52.209-6, Protecting the Government' Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (Dec 2010) (31 U.S.C. 6101 note).

<DESC><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Verdana">Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is developing an Energy Storage Monitoring System (ESMS) to ascertain the state-of-health and remaining useful life of energy storage technologies for multiple applications (e.g., automotive, military, space, etc.). A key component of the ESMS is accurate, in-situ measurements of the impedance spectra. INL has patent positions on an Impedance Measurement Box (IMB) which includes several unique approaches to rapidly determine the impedance spectra while the energy storage device (e.g., battery) is at rest or under load (e.g., while discharging or charging). These techniques are critical for accurate state-of-health prognostics in the overall ESMS, but could also be useful as stand-alone devices (e.g., acceptance testing in the field). The IMB was awarded an R&amp;D100 Award in June 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>INL is seeking industrial collaboration and funding to advance the development of the IMB from a pre-commercial prototype to a commercially viable diagnostic tool, either as a stand-alone unit or as part of the conceptual ESMS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Industrial participant(s) will have a right to seek up to an exclusive, field of use license to commercialize the IMB (or ESMS) technology. Additional information is available under nondisclosure agreement. <br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana', 'sans-serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Verdana"><br />Business Contact: David R.

After discussion with the offeror, the Contracting Officer may determine that the actual conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, mitigated or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, and the offeror may be found ineligible for award.<br />(c) Disclosure: The offeror hereby represents, to the best of its knowledge that:<br />___ (1) It is not aware of any facts which create any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest relating to the award of this contract, or<br />___ (2) It has included information in its proposal, providing all current information bearing on the existence of any actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest, and has included a mitigation plan in accordance with paragraph (d) of this provision.<br />(d) Mitigation.

The successful offeror shall inform the Contracting Officer within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of any corporate mergers, acquisitions, and/or divestures that may affect this provision.<br />(g) Flow-down. The contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in each first tier subcontract that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL CLAUSES AND PROVISIONS</p>
<p>Privacy<br />The Contractor shall be subject to the Privacy Act when handling relevant data and materials and shall comply with COMDTINST M5260.2 (Privacy and Freedom of Information Act Manual). The Contractor staff shall attend Government led Privacy Act Training prior to handling relevant data and materials.</p>
<p>Adherence to Regulations and Notices. The Contractor shall ensure that its personnel adhere to the policies promulgated in USCG Regulations, Federal Regulations, Commandant Instructions and Notices.</p>
<p>Professional Appearance. The Contractor's employees shall present a professional appearance at all times and their conduct shall not reflect discredit upon the United States, the Department of Homeland Security and the United States Coast Guard. If the Government feels there is a problem with a Contractor's appearance; the issue will be brought to the attention of the KO who will report the issue to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Employee Conduct. <br />Contractor's employees shall comply with all applicable Government regulations, policies and procedures (e.g., fire, safety, sanitation, environmental protection, security, "off limits" areas, wearing of parts of military uniforms, and possession of weapons) when visiting or working at Government facilities. The Contractor shall ensure contractor employees present a professional appearance at all times and that their conduct shall not reflect discredit on the United States, the Department of Homeland Security or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>Employee Identification.<br />Contractor employees visiting Government facilities shall wear an identification badge that, at minimum, displays the Contractor name, the employee's photo, name, clearance-level and badge expiration date. Visiting Contractor employees shall comply with all Government escort rules and requirements. All Contractor employees shall identify themselves as Contractors when their status is not readily apparent and display all identification and visitor badges in plain view above the waist at all times.</p>
<p>Removing Employees for Misconduct or Security Reasons. <br />The Government may, at its sole discretion, direct the Contractor to remove any Contractor employee from U.S. Coast Guard facilities for misconduct or security reasons. Removal does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue providing the services required under any task order awarded under this contract. The Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor with a written explanation to support any request to remove an employee.</p>
<p>Conflict of Interest. <br />The Contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States Government if that employment would, or would appear to cause a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Protection of Information. <br />Contractor access to information protected under the Privacy Act is required under this contract.

<p>Notice For Filing Agency Protests<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT<br />Dated - 08/31/2011</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Safety and Environmental Health has a requirement for training support services involving classroom instruction and field exercise training for a four-day Shore Confined Space Entry course (Code 500096, G-KSE-024) to a class size of 13 to 25 students. Training shall be held at the following locations: TRACEN Yorktown, Yorktown, VA; TRACEN Petaluma, Petaluma, CA; and Transportable to CG Unit TBD. USCG intends to fulfill this requirement by awarding a fixed-price contract for one year with four option years.</p>
<p>The Government has the option to add sessions to, or substitute for, the sessions listed in this Performance Work Statement (PWS) if agreed to by the Contractor and the USCG.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The training mission of the USCG is to provide quality safety, health, and environmental training to selected personnel in order to enhance skills at the basic, intermediate, and advanced levels in order to prepare personnel in their designated specialty or field.</p>
<p>Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue training reviews USCG policy COMDTINST M5100.47 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910.146, regarding Shore Confined Space Entry and Rescue procedures. Program management and implementation are covered including requirements for developing a written Confined Space Safety Instruction. The duties of entrants, attendants, entry supervisor, and rescue team members are discussed in detail. Characteristics of confined spaces are explained and methods taught to identify and distinguish a Non Permit required confined space from a Permit required confined space. Risk management of confined space entry is integrated into hazard recognition, evaluation, control, permitting, and monitoring procedures. Though focusing on shore-confined space, aviation-confined space is also reviewed.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 237310.<br /><br />All contractors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database, or their proposals will not be considered. Contractors can obtain further information on CCR and ORCA registration at the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://orca.bpn.gov/. The Davis Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141 et seq.) applies to this solicitation. Check the Wage Determination Online website at http://www.wdol.gov for current wage determination information from the Department of Labor.<br /><br />The release of the solicitation package should be on or about 2 August 2011. It will be a RFP, and there will not be a public bid opening. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided; the entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer for this project is Mr. Bill Carbrey. He can be reached at 316-759-4513 or at william.carbrey@us.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program
<SOLNBR>NOT-NHLBI-HV-13-00
<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>112111
<CONTACT>Paul D McFarlane, Contracting Officer, Email nhlbivita@nhlbi.nih.gov
<DESC><p>Vascular Interventions/Innovations and Therapeutic Advances (VITA) Program</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHBLI) is seeking feedback from potential Offerors and other interested parties relative to initiation of a new product development program. This is a special notice in advance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation planned to be issued during the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The Government is not obligated to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.</p>
<p>The new program, named "VITA", is intended to provide funding for early-stage translational development of product candidates in the fields of vascular and lymphatic disorders, thrombotic diseases, and pulmonary hypertension. This may include, but is not limited to, conditions under the Mission of NHLBI such as: peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysms and dissections, pulmonary vascular disorders, venous and arterial thrombosis, thromboembolic disorders, and disorders of the lymphatic system. Not included as specific topics in this program are diseases of the coronary and intracranial arteries.</p>
<p>In the context of the VITA program, the term "product candidate" is used to refer to new diagnostics, new therapeutic agents, or novel applications of existing agents and/or therapeutic interventions. The product(s) under study and development can include, but are not limited to: small molecules, small peptides, proteins or antibodies, devices, diagnostic tests, genetic markers, and cell or gene agents.</p>
<p>The VITA program is designed to fund proposals that fall under one of two broad early stages of product development: 1) proposals seeking support for work in the window between principle discovery and the demonstration and confirmation of "proof of principle"(POP) in the form of various preclinical efficacy assessments and preliminary safety evaluations, and 2) proposals for further development and testing of product candidates with demonstrated proof of principle, such as studies to support an IND or IDE application.</p>
<p>This contract will be open to all Offerors with a product candidate in the applicable medical fields regardless of institutional affiliation or prior product development experience. Awards in either stage will be up to three years in duration and project funding through the VITA Program does not preclude supplemental outside funding from academia or the private sector on that same project. The VITA contract program will also support a separate Program Coordinating Center (PCC) that will provide project management, meeting coordination, and regulatory advice for funded Offerors who require such services. However, this Request For Information (RFI) is not seeking information from parties interested in the PCC; rather responses should come only from parties interested in the described product development.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>NHLBI has identified "opportunity gaps" for two stages of translation: (1) between the conceptualization of potential medical advances and the experimental validation of those concepts as medical product candidates, and (2) between the demonstration of proof of principle and the completion of studies required for the assessment of a product candidate in human clinical trials. As part of its mission to improve the health of the American public, NHLBI is establishing the VITA Program to stimulate the advancement of medical product development in these two specific opportunity gaps.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND POINTS OF CONSIDERATION</p>
<p>NHBLI invites interested parties with potential product candidates in the designated applicable medical fields to respond to the questions listed below.</p>
<p>1. Contact Information - Provide name and email address and employment affiliation related to your product candidate. (This is optional, but inclusion of your contact information ensures that you will be informed about any updates regarding this solicitation.)</p>
<p>2. Within the scope of disease conditions listed above for the VITA Program , what unmet medical need(s) will your proposed product candidate(s) address? (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>3. Describe your product candidate and how it will address the unmet medical need(s) to benefit public health. (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>4. Please describe the current state of development of your proposed product candidate(s). Which stage of the VITA Program ("Principle to POP" or "POP to IND/IDE") would be most appropriate for your proposed product candidate(s)? (max. 250 words)</p>
<p>5. Please describe your own level of experience with product development. Other than additional funding, what kind of additional resources and/or expertise are needed in order to advance your product candidate(s) toward human clinical evaluation? (max. 250 words)<br />RESPONSE GUIDELINES</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is covered under the Privacy Act System of Records 09-25-0156, "Records of Participants in Programs and Respondents in Surveys Used to Evaluate Programs of the Public Health Service, HHS/PHS/NIH/OD."</p>
<p>This RFI is for collecting information to improve the planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a grant or contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI. Nor does it otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Government's evaluation of the information received. All responses will be regarded as confidential. No basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent announcement. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any related future solicitations. Responses will be held in a confidential manner. Any proprietary information should be so marked. NHLBI appreciates your input.</p>
<p>Send responses to the five (5) questions in this RFI to Paul D. McFarlane, Contracting Officer, NHLBI, NIH, e-mail: <a href="mailto:NHLBIVITA@NIH.GOV">NHLBIVITA@NIH.GOV</a>. Please&nbsp;include this notice's number&nbsp;[NOT-NHLBI-HV-13-00] in the subject line. Responses&nbsp;are due no later than 4 PM EST, Monday, November 21, 2011. In addition, questions regarding this RFI may be directed to Mr. McFarlane at the same e-mail address.<br /><br />Updates and additional information&nbsp;regarding the&nbsp;VITA program&nbsp;are available on the following website <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/faq-NHLBIVITA.htm">http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/faq-NHLBIVITA.htm</a>.</p>

<DESC>Below please find the National Park Service's (NPS) responses to questions submitted for the Prospectus for a Concession Business Opportunity Guided Horseback Rides within Rocky Mountain National Park.
1)	 Our business does not have a DUNS number from Dunn & Bradstreet. I am not able to get a credit report (from them) without this number. Should I include an explanation or can I substitute another report for it?
Please refer to the Proposal Package, Subfactor 4(a)(3) on Page 16 that specifically states a current credit report from any major credit reporting company such as Equifax, Experian, or Dunn & Bradstreet is acceptable. Usually current credit reports may also be obtained through your financial institution.  
2)	 We are rewriting our Wrangler handbook. Is a summary of its contents sufficient or should we include a copy in the proposal?
None of the questions in the Proposal Package requests a copy of an employee handbook. Please refer to Subfactor 2b., Stock and Equipment on Page 10 of the Proposal Package, which asks you how you will train your staff. You should answer that question in the manner you deem appropriate or sufficient.  
3)	Regarding the visitor trail ride briefing: should the instructions by the wrangler be verbal or could we present the briefing verbally and also hand out a summary sheet of expectations to the visitors?
Please refer to Exhibit B, Operating Plan, F1. Visitor Orientation, on Page B-5 that specially states the wrangler must brief all riders on proper and safe procedures. With regards to adding a handout, there is no prohibition on providing visitors with a handout in addition to a trail riding briefing.
4)	If we want to add a trail to our assigned trails, do we propose that in the proposal or is that negotiated with the Superintendent after being awarded the contract?
Please refer to Principle Selection Factor 2, Offeror's Trail Use, item 1 on Page 9 of the Proposal Package that specially asks the Offerors to provide names and locations of designated horse trails that it proposes to use.5)	On the (CD) disk, Appendix 13, Section Proposal Package, page 3.  The words "Grand Teton National Park" are used and we do not understand.
Appendix 13 of the Proposal Package on the original CD erroneously referenced Grand Teton National Park instead of Rocky Mountain National Park. This error was discovered and new CDs, marked "Corrected" were sent to all recipients of the original Prospectus on September 29, 2011 via Federal Express. Additionally Errata#1, which provided notice of this error, was posted on Fed Biz Opps.gov on September 29, 2011.
6)	On the disk, Appendix 13, Section Proposal Package, page 16, Subfactor 4(b) #2.  What Appendix number should be used?
The number of the Appendix in Subfactor 4(b) 2 was inadvertently left off. This sentence should have stated "Using the Excel spreadsheets provided in Appendix 12..."  
7)	On the disk, Appendix 13, Section Addendum 1, page A1-5, #6.  Is this clause allowed on the release for the guests' horseback riding?
Addendum 1, Item #6 on Page A1-5 is titled INDEMNIFICATION.  NPS policy does not allow Concessioners to require park visitors to indemnify, release or hold harmless the Concessioner. Please refer to Exhibit B, Operating and Maintenance Plan, and Attachment D: Visitor's Acknowledgement of Risks, which is the sample form that the NPS requires its Concessioners to use, if they do use such a form. The only additions allowed are to fill in the blanks (___) shown in this sample form.
8)	On the disk, Appendix 13, Section Exhibit B: Operating Plan, page B-14.  Is Attachment D the only option for a release form?  For minor children in Colorado it is required for the relationship of the adult and the minor to be defined.
The sample Visitor's Acknowledgement of Risk form is the only form that has been approved for use by NPS Concessioners.  The laws of the state where an activity occurs are the laws that would be applied in a tort action.  If you have a specific concern about the form and a request for a minor deviation, you may submit it to the Park for review and approval.  Please be mindful that the Service is reluctant to approve changes unless there is a good and valid reason to do so. Please note that there is a signature line for the parent or Guardian of any minor children.
9)	On the disk, Appendix 13, Section Operating and Maintenance Plan, page B-5, #4.  Is this operating hours or ride departure times?
On Page B-5 of Exhibit B Operating and Maintenance Plan, E. Operating Dates and Hours of Operation, Item #4, states "at a minimum liveries will be open 7 days a week from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm." This is the minimum operating hours of the livery. Operators may set their own operating hours or departure time of the rides as long as the business is at least open during the hours stated above.

<DESC>DARPA issued BAA-11-40 to solicit ideas for its new Human Language Technology (HLT) research and development program called Broad Operational Language Translation (BOLT), specifically with the intended purpose to solicit proposed research that investigates innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems; not merely research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. The purpose of BOLT is to specifically create technology capable of the following:
<p>1. Translate multiple foreign languages in all genres, retrieving information from the translated material, and enabling bilingual communication via speech or text;</p>
<p>2. Accurate translation into English of all language genres, including informal speech and text such as occurs in e-mail, messaging and conversational speech in Arabic (including a variety of dialects such as Levantine or Iraqi) and Mandarin Chinese;</p>
<p>3. Capability for human-machine communication by voice in English and Arabic using multi-modal input for robotic control or desk-top applications and multi-turn, bilingual human-human conversation in speech or text including a monolingual human-machine dialogue in both languages for clarification and disambiguation;</p>
<p>4. Capability to retrieve targeted information from multi-lingual sources using natural language English queries with human-machine clarification and disambiguation dialogue and means to annotate documents (textual or spoken) for fast comprehensive search;</p>
<p>5. Research in deep semantic language acquisition using robotic visual and tactile information as input for experiential learning of objects, actions, and consequences; and</p>
<p>6. Research in basic technologies such as parsing, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), language modeling, etc. that is essential to the success of the above.</p>

<DESC>The contractor shall perform the work required by this SOW to advance theunderstanding of aircraft wake vortices by: (i) Characterizing sensors for datacollection, (ii) planning data collection activities, (iii) collecting wake vortex andmeteorological data, and (iv) assessing and improving numerical wake vortex models suchas the fast-time, deterministic, and probabilistic models.The contractor shall:	Characterize existing sensors and sensing capabilities typically used forground-based, terminal-area Wake Vortex measurements of position and strength. Establishfull set of wake vortex, meteorological, aircraft, and air traffic operational parametersrequired to be measured and test conditions for several test scenarios. Correlate sensorparameters with required data.	Develop a ground-based, terminal-area, Data Collection Test Program to collectdata that can be used to validate existing wake vortex prediction tools. Data to becollected will be as determined in objective 1.	Collect meteorological and wake vortex position and strength data as determinedin objective 2.	Conduct a robust validation of wake vortex models. The purpose of this validationis to evaluate the predictions of wake vortex behavior from the wake vortex models.Should this effort identify deficiencies in the wake vortex models, the contractor shalldocument these deficiencies and use this information to guide model refinements.Enhanceas requiredexisting fast-time wake vortex prediction tools using the data ascollected in objective 3. This includes both deterministic and probabilistic tools that,as applied to reduced aircraft spacing, can:a.	Predict the probability of wake location.b.	Predict the probability of wake location and strength.The unified solution in item b above ensures that the more complex strength solutionremains consistent with the location solution.

<DESC>Greenbelt Lake is located in Bicentennial Park, a popular municipal park in the center of the City. This is a 5.4 acre lake that is located adjacent to the public library and serves as a centerpiece for Bicentennial Park.<br><br>The existing control structure at the lake consists of a concrete gravity weir. The weir is about 100 feet wide. Elevation drops about 14 feet from the lake impoundment to the Pistol Creek channel below the dam. The dam is equipped with two low-level screw gate outlets to allow drawdown of the lake.<br><br>The lake has suffered detrimental impacts due to severe sedimentation and a large population of nuisance wildlife (Canada geese and various duck species). These waterfowl add large quantities of nutrients and bacteria to the lake, negatively impacting the quality of the aquatic environment. The proposed project would excavate sediment from Greenbelt Lake and relocate most of the waterfowl.<br><br>Prior to sediment removal activities, the lake will be drained by siphoning the water around the dam. The inflows from Pistol and Brown Creek will be diverted through temporary piping to the spillway south of the dam to prevent an increase in turbidity downstream of the lake. Approximately 2,230 feet of piping will be required to divert the water.<br><br>Cofferdams, approximately 7 feet high, equipped with outlet pipes at the base, will be placed at the outfalls of Pistol and Brown Creeks as a detainment area for the inflows prior to discharge through the temporary piping system. The exact height and location of the cofferdams will be determined through site specific measurements. Cofferdams will be placed in such a way as to maximize the lakebed area available for excavation and facilitate connectivity with the shoreline. The cofferdam system will incorporate the use of nylon or polyester reinforced fabric to create watertight seals with the existing shoreline. A flume boot will be installed to create a watertight seal around the discharge pipe. Any necessary reinforcement within the substrate support system will be evaluated and remedied by a certified installation technician.<br><br>Conventional mechanical equipment, such as excavators and bulldozers, will be used to remove sediment from Greenbelt Lake. The sediment will be de-watered at designated locations within the project site. The sediment will then be trucked to the local landfill for disposal. Temporary bridges will be utilized throughout the lake as crossing areas for the excavation equipment.<br><br>A sediment weir structure will be constructed at the small island near the upstream end of the<br>impoundment. The purpose of the weir is to facilitate sediment deposition in the<br>upstream end of the lake. This will trap and remove sediment during high flows before it can be transported downstream. The weir will consist of large-sized boulders (3ft x 2 ft) to create a natural boulder wall. The top elevation of the weir will be approximately 1 foot above the water surface. To provide additional erosion protection and enhanced fisheries habitat, large cobblestones will be placed on top of geotextile fabric at the lake bed. The upstream impoundment area will be used as a sediment collection area, which will require periodic<br>maintenance at approximately IS-year intervals. The Sponsor is aware of this requirement.<br><br>Greenbelt Lake, Alternative GL - 3. Excavate to 8-foot depth in all areas, with steep<br>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>1. Contracting Activity.<br />Contracting Activity: Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC), Acquisition Management Directorate, Code 02, 693 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702, is acquiring on behalf of the requesting agency: Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), 503 Robert Grant Avenue, Silver Spring, MD 20901.</p>
<p>2. Description of the Action Being Approved. <br />Approval is requested to award a single contract to Histogenetics Inc., 300 Executive Boulevard, Ossining, NY 10562 for medical support services to process all sample and HLA typing requests with state-of-the art large volume high resolution typing.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services<br />The NMRC has a critical need for medical support services to process all samples and typing requests with state-of-the-art automated instrumentation and bio-informatic tools. Accuracy of allele level typing is further assured by a dual method-high resolution sequence specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP) typing and Sequence Based Typing (SBT) with further laboratory validation. The contractor's facility must be certified by American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogentics (ASHI) accreditation which is mandatory for the NMRC Bone Marrow Program laboratory.</p>
<p>Typing will be performed to allele resolution genetic typing using the July 2010 World Health <br />Organization (WHO) definitions with complete resolution for all alleles defined in exon 2 and 3 for HLA- A, -B, and -C (and for selected samples for exon 4 where required by the Government to resolve ambiguity) and all alleles defined by exon 2 for HLA- DRB1 using DNA <br />sequence-based method requirements. During the base year (and option years if exercised);8,600 samples will be sent to the contractor over a two month period to be typed. Samples must be typed and returned to NMRC within 30 days from receipt of each sample for 95% of the samples (8,170) and the remaining 5% (430) must be completed within 60 days from receipt of each sample.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this contract is anticipated to be a base period of 12-months, followed by two 12-month option periods for a total of 36-months. The type of funds being utilized in the base period are FY2011 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E).</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. <br />10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), One source or limited sources.</p>
<p>5. Rationale Justifying Use of Cited Statutory Authority. <br />The C. W. Bill Young/Department of Defense (DoD) Marrow Donor Program and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) perform allele level testing on a large number (8,600) of volunteer donors at the time of initial recruitment as potential marrow donor volunteers. This results in a significant increase in the number of completely resolved allele typed donors on the DoD and NMDP donor files. The data will also be used for additional scientific studies of the genetics of marrow transplant matching. Typing donors at the time of initial recruitment also allows for the ability to more rapidly find donors and the ability to better determine the percentage of newly entering donors that have novel HLA alleles.</p>
<p>Histogenetics is the only company that has demonstrated the capability and experience to perform the number of unambiguous allele level HLA types required. Buccal swabs from 8,600 donors will be sent to the contractor in shipments over a two month period. Samples must be typed and returned within 30 days from receipt of each sample for 95% of the samples (8,170) and the remaining 5% (430) must be completed within 60 days from receipt of each sample. Histogenetics successfully typed 15,000 samples at the unambiguous allele level under Contract N62645-10-C-4067 and 11,000 samples under Contract N62645-08-P-2152. Both contracts were awarded on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>To complete the DNA typing, the laboratory and personnel must be certified at the unambiguous allele Level by the ASHI. The required certification is the most difficult certification level to obtain and means that each nucleic acid that codes for the HLA molecule is precisely defined without ambiguity. Histogenetics possesses the required certification.</p>
<p>Awarding this follow-on contract to Histogenetics will reduce the start-up time involved in training the laboratory technicians and time allotted for adjustments in performing the services. The start-up cost is estimated at $20,000.00 for this fiscal year. A follow-on contract award to the contractor provides for continuity of services as the key personnel resources that are capable of starting work immediately after contract award are already in place. An award to a new contractor may delay the performance of services up to six months and prevent the typing of donors at the time of initial recruitment. This significantly slows the ability to find donors and the ability to better determine the percentage of newly entering donors that have novel HLA alleles.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Solicit Offers from as Many Offerors as Practicable. <br />The proposed contract was synopsized on the FedBizOpps website on 1 August 2011. No other known sources have expressed an interest in allele resolution genetic typing. Previous notices of intent have been placed on FedBizOpps for prior contracts for this service (N62645-10-C-4067 and N62645-08-P-2152) and no interested parties have come forward.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost. <br />The Contracting Officer will perform a price analysis in order to determine that the anticipated cost to the Government of the services covered by this J&amp;A will be fair and reasonable. The Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) and past purchase history will form the basis of the price analysis.</p>
<p>8. Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. <br />For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the type of services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, NMLC will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible.</p>

<p>1)	Strengthening the capacity of Congolese civil society and the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) to conduct civic and voter education activities effectively; <br />2)	Designing and producing civic and voter education materials related to the decentralization process and future local elections in the DRC; and,<br />3)	Implementing civic and voter education activities in the targeted provinces.</p>
Under this proposed extension, IFES would continue to implement activities according to the following objectives:
<p>1)	Civic and voter education materials needed in anticipation of the civic education campaign for local elections are produced, together with the CENI;<br />2)	Targeted local CSOs, CENI staff, educators, youth, women, religious leaders, community radio and journalists develop the capacity to conduct civic and voter education efforts related to the decentralization process and elections;<br />3)	Citizens receive accurate information about the electoral process that is tailored to the local context and is audience-appropriate; and<br />4)	The use of innovative mechanisms to provide citizens with real-time information on the electoral process, including conflict mitigation and dispute resolution within the electoral context are explored and used on a trial basis.</p>
<p>During this extension, IFES will meet the following specific objectives:</p>
<p>Objective 1: Civic and voter education materials needed in anticipation of the civic education campaign for local elections are produced, together with the CENI; <br />Objective 2: Targeted local CSOs, CENI staff, educators, youth, women, religious leaders, community radio and journalists develop the capacity to conduct civic and voter education efforts related to the decentralization process and elections; <br />Objective 3: Citizens receive accurate information about the electoral process that is tailored to the local context and is audience-appropriate; and<br />Objective 4: The use of innovative mechanisms to provide citizens with real-time information on the electoral process, including conflict mitigation and dispute resolution within the electoral context are explored and used on a trial basis.</p>

Sole Source Justification
2011 NCMA Government Contract
Management Conference

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3 and in accordance with the requirements of FAR 6.303-1, this justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.3 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows:

(1) Agency and Contracting Activity'

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL)
Center for Acquisition Innovation~ 1776 I St. NW, Room 970, Washington, DC 20006.

(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved

OAL proposes to enter into enter into a noncompetitive, sole source contract with Network Media Partners, 11350 McCormick Rd, STE 900, Hunt Valley, MD 21031 who are directly affiliated with the National Contract Management Association (NCMA), 21740 Beaumeade Circle, Suite 125, Ashburn, VA 20147. OAL has a requirement to continue its participation in the Government Contract Management Conference (GCMC) as a Gold sponsor of the National Contract Management Association (NCMA) Annual Conference and to participate at the 2011 NCMA Government Contract Management Conference (GCMC) which is scheduled to take place in Bethesda, Maryland from November 14 to 15, 2011.

(3) Description of Supplies/Services-Describe the supplies or services to be acquired

The purpose of this endeavor is for V A OAL to enter into a sole source contract with Network Media Partners in order to secure their Gold sponsorship of the NCMA GCMC which only Network Media Partners has the capability to do. This contract with Network Media Partners is required in order to maintain VA's Gold sponsorship of and participation in the NCMA Government Contract Management Conference (GCMC) in Bethesda, Maryland which is scheduled to occur from November 14 to 15. 2011. The NCMA corporate membership as a Gold sponsor provides VA with the opportunity to host a booth at the NCMA Government Contract Management Conference and establish a presence among the Agency's peers in the Federal acquisition community. This conference is a way for the acquisition community to network~ discuss the impact of contract management processes, and share best practices for increasing the efficiency of contract departments. There is a Contract Management Career Fair, which VA will


attend. This career fair provides VA a broader area in which to advertise and discuss our job openings in acquisition. The total flat rate for V A to be a Gold sponsor at the GCMC is $6,300. This fee includes a 10% discount already deducted from the general rate of $7,000. This discount is applied in accordance with the terms and conditions of VA's current corporate sponsorship agreement with NCMA.

(4) Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253
(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1
entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy
Agency Requirements."

(5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited.

The Gold corporate sponsorship of and participation in the GCMC will give V A OAL direct access to the members of the Federal and industry acquisition community as only provided by NCMA and offered only through Network Media Partners. There is no other national association that represents members of the acquisition community as NCMA. No other company but Network Media Partners provides the access to this conference through this specific Gold sponsorship. This particular NCMA conference is important because it provides unparalleled access and exposure to industry and Government experts.

(6) Description of the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202

Market research was conducted to determine if any professional organizations currently
exist capable of providing the same NCMA conference services and opportunity that is
offered through Network Media Partners under NAICS code 611430 - Professional and
Management Development Training. VetBiz.gov was surveyed to indentify SDVOSB
firms (under VA '8 statutory authority) capable of meeting the Government's known
requirement at this time. However, none were found to be able to provide the level and
caliber of opportunities and exposure as Network Media Partners does with their unique
business relationship with NCMA and ability to provide the required professional space
and attendance of this conference. Additionally, current GSA schedules were examined
to determine if any schedule holders offered comparable membership opportunities.
Specifically, Schedule 874 - Mission Oriented Business Integrated Services (MOBIS)
was deemed to be the most likely to offer organizational membership services geared
toward the Federal contracting profession. However, none of the corresponding
categories described services that could meet this requirement. Thus, market research
indicated that Network Media Partners is the only entity offering the unique services and
exposure to the NCMA GCMC. That being said, NCMA is the only national organization



of its kind, and as such provides public and private organizations the essential forum for
industry interaction in the form of the GCMC. The type of expert exposure provided by
the GCMC directly contributes to OAL's organizational success.

Because of the minimal dollar threshold, this requirement does not have to be synopsized.
The Sole Source Justification and Approval will be posted to the GPE within 14 days
after contract award as per' FAR 6.305(a) and will remain posted for 30 days as per FAR
6.305(d)(3).

(7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost 10 the Government
will be Fair and Reasonable.

Network Media Partner's product pricing is established under a standing catalog price list
through the association. The Contracting Officer has made a determination that the price
is fair and reasonable based on review of commercial list prices and the prices paid in the
past for similar services.

(8) Description of Market Research. Market Research is required by FAR Part 10.
Describe the results of your market research.

Research was done through reviewing the available professional associations that
participate in federal acquisition continuity events. This analysis determined that
NCMA best suited the requirements of V A OAL; therefore, Network Media Partners,
being the only organization capable of supplying the required services, best suited V A
OAL's requirements .. No other suppliers were found that provide the unique access to
the NCMA GCMC.

(9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.

Network Media Partners is the only provider of booth space at the NCMA GCMC.
Concurrently, NCMA is the only provider of any services and access to the acquisition
community by virtue of its position as a professional association representing acquisition
professionals. This Gold sponsorship of NCMA is only available through Network
Media Partners, This is the only source that satisfies and possesses the capabilities to
provide these unique services to V A contracting organizations.

(10) A Listing of the Sources. it Any That Expressed, in Writing. an Interest in the
Acquisition.

No other sources expressed an interest in providing the aforementioned services.






(11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required.

For future acquisition conference opportunities, VA OAL personnel will continue to
research the industry to try to determine other cost-effective alternatives.

(12) Certifications:

This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.








I certify this requirement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting
data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate.

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Denver Acquisition and Logistics Center (DALC)

2.  Description of Action
Using the VAs Veterans First Contracting program, the DALC intends to enter into a sole source contract with the following firm: 
TDB Communications Inc.
10901 W 84th Ter  #105
Overland Park, KS 66214

3.  Description of Services
The requirement is for support personnel to assist the DALC by providing Data Entry and Hearing Device Data Entry support services. All services shall be performed on-site at the DALC facility located at 155 Van Gordon St., Lakewood, CO 80228; or other specified DALC location.  All services are non-personal in nature.  Performance will be according to the requirements contained in a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Contractor employees will not be considered or treated as federal employees for any purpose, will not be regarded as performing a personal service, and will not be eligible for civil service employee benefits, including retirement.  Services furnished by contractor employees will be performed as necessary to fulfill the requirements of the PWS.  Contract workers provided under this award will remain under the direct control of the contractor; however, they will be expected to take guidance from the Customer Service Section Supervisor, VSD Lab or Veteran Services Division Chief for specific assignments necessary to fulfill those requirements.  Employee performance, behavioral, and employment status issues will remain the responsibility of the contractor.  Government estimate redacted.

4.  Statutory Authority
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-5, Authorized or Required by Statute is 38 USC 8127, Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Veterans: Contracting Goals and Preferences; 38 USC 8128, Small Business Concerns Owned and Controlled by Veterans: Contracting Priority; and VAAR 819.7007, sole source awards to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns.  The identified contractor is an SDVOSB, duly registered and verified in the VetBiz vendor pages as required by VAAR 819.7007(c).

5.  Competitive Efforts
This requirement is being procured using the VAs Veterans First Contracting program and FAR 6.302-5 as referenced in paragraph 4 above.  
The requirement will be synopsized in accordance with VAAR Part 813.106 (b) and FAR part 5.

6.  Fair and Reasonable Price
In accordance with FAR 6.303-2(a)(7), the contracting officer anticipates prices to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on previous history.  The previous procurement was effected within the last 12 months.

8.  Other factors

TDB Communications has successfully performed its contractually obligations since the inception of the prior task order and has demonstrated that it is a responsible contractor as set forth in
FAR 9.104-1.  Conducting another competitive procurement is not expected to result in better prices or other benefits to the Government.

9. Certification
