<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for additional work under order NNC05QA36P work joining investigation between refractory metals and nicke-base superalloys.  The following statement of work describes the additional work required.  This work is within scope of the original requirement.   Additional  Work for Joining Investigation Between Refractory Metals and Nickel-Base Superalloys NASA will provide the materials. Vendor requirements and deliverables contained in subtasks. Length of time for contract:  3 months Final Report required. T-111 is a tantalum alloy. 3 (b). Electro-Spark Deposition (ESD) The Contractor is to examine specimens joined by ESD.  Because of the manual method that will likely be used, and the slow deposition process, NASA is intentionally limiting observations to a few small“sheet” specimens.  For convenience,  a sheet tensile specimen which for some of the materials is already available.  NASA suggests cutting a tensile specimen in half at the center of the gage section and joining the two dissimilar materials.  The reduced cross section is nominally 0.250 inch wide and 0.020 inch thick.  Contractor is to provide three specimens: 1) exhibit piece, 2) section as-welded for metallographic evaluation 3) 1,000 hr (TBD) thermal exposure specimen or RT tensile specimen for the following material combinations: –	Mo47Re strip to Hastelloy X –	T-111 strip to Hastelloy X NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Edison Welding Institute, of Columbus, OH.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source (U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)).  Due to EWI's unique qualifications and historical experience, their leadership in R&D involving  magnetic pulse welding, inertia welding and electro-spark facilities in-house, enables them to make critical examinations and decisions toward both material and process optimization. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. (EST)local time on May 27, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences intends to award a sole source purchase order to Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA 94086, pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This procurement is for Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0 array; Kit One-cycle target labeling and control reagents;  Kit, Two-cycle target labeling and control reagents. With the One-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIEHS NCT Microarray Group will be able to perform a single round amplification from 1ìg Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays.  Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays with the spike-in control targets.  By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the NCT. 
With the Two-Cycle Target Labeling and Control Reagents, the NIEHS NCT Microarray Group will be able to perform a double round amplification from 10çg Total RNA for use on Affymertix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays.  This low amount of starting material is ideal for Laser Capture Microdiscetion studies that are ongoing at NIEHS.  Based on discussions with multiple sales representatives from various companies and internet searches there is no other package on the market that combines all reagents necessary for performing labeling and hybridization for Affymetrix Eukaryotic GeneChip™ Arrays with the spike-in control targets.  Each kit contains 1 each of: IVT labeling kit, Two-cycle cDNA synthesis kit, Sample clean-up module, Poly-A RNA Control Kit & Hybridization Controls.  By purchasing this all-in-one kit from Affymetrix quality control, lot variation, and expiration of reagents are all controlled yielding higher quality data for the NCT. 
The Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array is 30 packs of GeneChip™ Arrays for covering the entire mouse genome.  These arrays are the only arrays that can be used in the Affymetrix GeneChip™ system (consisting of hybridization oven, fluidics station, and laser scanner).  Affymetrix high-density probe arrays can offer oligo densities as high as 106 per cm2.  This high density feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents, USP Nos. 5,445,934 and 5,744,305 as well as others.  Typically, Affymetrix produces arrays with over 1,000,000 probe locations, or features, within 1.28 square centimeters.  Each individual feature harbors millions of DNA molecules.  High probe density allows for the generation of a maximum amount of robust data with a single microarray.  This minimizes sample requirements and simplifies prep work and data analysis.  Also, Affymetrix’s photolithographic manufacturing technology enables consistent reproduction of probe array designs and reduces variation inherent in less sophisticated array manufacturing technologies.  This feature is unique to Affymetrix and covered by patents USP Nos. 5,424,186 and 5,510,270 as well as others. The NIEHS NCT currently has an Affymetrix system and by patents only Affymetrix GeneChips  can be used with the system.  The one and two cycle labeling kits have been used in NIEHS for two years now and using other labeling technologies would compromise ongoing experiments and compromise the integrity of data flowing into the CEBS database.

Faxed responses will be accepted at 919 541-5117.   Responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.

HU25 FULL FACE QUICK DONNING OXYGEN MASK PART NUMBER (P/N) MF10-03-02 REPAIR/OVERHAUL
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
16 MAY 05

1.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Masks, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, were installed in these aircraft in 1991and are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  

2.	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or an FAA authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.  Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications In Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition and will be replaced as necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6) years. 

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First, a “return to service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy., Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.) if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements (component time continues). Secondly, an overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary. An overhaul zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO). 

The Contractor shall install Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to Hose Assembly P/N DTS series for both repair and overhaul.  

The Contractor shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The Contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul oxygen masks.
The Contractor responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work. 

3.	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS 
THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE APPLICABLE:

3.1	OEM Component Maintenance manual: 
CMM 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003

3.2	CG Technical Orders:
3.2.1	CG TCTO HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992
3.3	Data Availability:
3.3.1	OEM manuals, Service Bulletins and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the Coast Guard.
3.3.2	Coast Guard specific CGTOs, can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Submit a written request to:

Commanding Officer
Attn:  ARSC FOIA Officer
United States Coast Guard
Aircraft Repair & Supply Center
Elizabeth City, NC 27909

4.	SERVICE BULLETINS
All OEM SBs previously incorporated shall remain incorporated. SBs which upgrade the component or improve reliability shall be incorporated upon approval of CG’s Contracting Officer.

<CONTACT>Suzanne Johnson, Contracting Officer , Phone 202-712-1606, Fax 202-216-3396, Email sjohnson@usaid.gov
<DESC>USAID/Washington (hereinafter to as USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to provide recruitment, employment, and backstopping of Technical Advisors in AIDS, Child Survival, Infectious Diseases, Population and Basic Education (hereafter abbreviated TAACS) as authorized in the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act FY 87 to assist USAID in the implementation of priority programs in the health, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, population and basic education sectors.  

The RFP will be issued/posted on USAID’s agency website: www.fedbizops.gov under the section on business and procurement on or about February 03, 2005.

Background information follows:

The TAACS Program is managed by the Bureau for Global Health (GH), and is currently providing 69 TAACS to the Agency, approximately half of whom are serving with overseas Missions.  Because the TAACS mechanism is a major Agency resource, providing staff with direct-hire authorities to carry out the Agency’s key programs, a TAACS contract that provides strong recruitment and backstopping support is essential to the Agency’s effectiveness, particularly to Basic Education and the Expanded Response in HIV-AIDS and Infectious Diseases.  

The Contractor shall reliably and efficiently complete tasks for recruitment, hiring and placement, training, backstopping, supervising, and evaluating TAACS, who will provide long term technical and managerial assistance to USAID overseas and to various technical offices in USAID/Washington. They will work in the design, management, implementation and evaluation of child survival, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, population and basic education activities. Upon selection, the Contractor will employ them as employees of the Contractor’s organization while the TAACS provide technical advice and management capabilities to the USAID Offices and Missions.

The USAID TAACS Program Coordinator, Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and the Contract Director shall undertake appropriate coordination with other USAID offices, bureaus, and Missions with respect to the Agency guidance on Technical Advisors in AIDS and Child Survival, as contained in USAID Automated Directives System (ADS) Series 200, References.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract modification to General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), 8201 East McDowell Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85252-1417 on a sole source basis.  The requirement is to procure the integration of 21 Generator, Environmental Control Unit (ECU), and Trailer (GETs), initial spares, consumables, and training that meets the Marine Corps’ need for an integrated power and environmental control subsystem solution for the Unit Operations Center (UOC).  GDC4S is the original equipment manufacturer and integrator for UOC System under contract number M67854-02-C-2052 and integrates the components of the GET into an effective subsystem.  GDC4S will be responsible for all aspects of system performance in stand-alone mode and as an integrated component into the digital UOC.  Although components are provided by subcontractors, GDC4S has developed the expertise to assemble the components into the appropriate!  configuration.    GDC4S is the only company able to provide the total integration process, no other firm has the technical knowledge, special tooling and test equipment, and familiarity to perform the tasks mentioned above without incurring significant additional non-recurring cost and schedule impact to the Marine Corps.  The Marine Corps does not possess the drawing package or other engineering data associated with the equipment to support competition for the integration and associated training for these componenets. The UOC GET solution provided under this contract meets the Marine Corps requirements for power and ECU weight, on an Army certified and supported trailer designed to carry gear associated with the UOC including tents of specific size and weight, supporting ducts, and cables.   No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding.  However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement.  All comm! unications shall be in writing.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected.  See numbered note 22.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Alternative CO2 Control Technology Research.  Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal systems for Mars represent an especially challenging area of development.  Lithium hydroxide canisters have impractical logistics penalties, and regenerable metal oxide canisters weigh too much.  Cycling bed systems and permeable membranes that are regenerable in space vacuum cannot vent on Mars due to the high partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere.  Although sweep gas regeneration is under investigation, the feasibility, logistics penalties, and failure modes associated with this technique have not been proven.  The purpose of this task is to research Low TRL, alternative CO2 removal technologies, specifically for reducing on back weight and resupply penalties for a Mars mission.  Some examples are laser CO2 decomposition, zirconia cell CO2 recycling, and cryogenic freeze out with a liquid oxygen-based system.  Design concepts shall be generated based on an assessment of competing technology options, and feasibility or proof-of-concept experimentation will be conducted. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about June 15, 2005 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about July 13, 2005. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/JSC Business Opportunities home page is     http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.   All contractual technical questions must be submitted in writing  by e-mail.  Telephone questions will not be accepted.

<DESC>This service project consists of  pile burning in the Palmer Creek and Fuller North burn units. Over the past several years hazardous fuel reduction projects and wildlife habitat enhancement projects have been implemented at the Seward Ranger District.  The implementations of these projects resulted in 369 acres containing piles of fuel, which are now ready to be disposed of by burning.  These pile burns can be rated as non-complex.  Non-complex burns have no or minimal control problems present, and little or no risk to resources, personnel and equipment. Piles burned to 80% consumption or more.  Any fire creeping from perimeters will be immediately contained.  Level of difficulty for hand pile burns can be determined by piles per acre, size of piles and access.  Each unit is accessible by road.  Palmer Creek is 204 acres with 15 piles per acre.  Smallest pile is 10 x 5 with the largest pile being 22 x 12.  Fuller is 165 acres with 8 piles per acre.  Smallest pile is 3 x 3 with the largest pile being 28 x 22.  Location of Palmer Creek Units – T09N; R02W; S ½ Sec 3. and N ½ Sec 10.  Fuller North – T04N; R04W; Sec 28.

<DESC>This service project consists of fuels reduction in the Victor Creek project area.   The purpose of this project is to reduce wildland fire potential in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), provide firefighter safety, and improve forest health conditions in the Victor Creek project area.  Spruce trees across Alaska have been killed in large numbers by the spruce bark beetle, leaving dead trees across the landscape and a high risk of wildland fires. On the Kenai Peninsula in the Victor Creek area, the forest conditions have been identified to be at an extremely high risk. Implementation of these treatments would substantially reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfires being started or carried through these portions of the Chugach National Forest. 
OBJECTIVES:  Reduce hazardous fuel loads created by spruce bark beetle caused mortality. Enhance vegetative structural diversity and regeneration.

SCOPE
The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) and supplies to perform manual fuel reduction work on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest.  Manual fuel reduction will take place in the Victor Creek project area, north of Victor Creek and east of the Seward Highway.  The work consists of tree felling, limbing and bucking.

<DESC>Description
This service project consists of  prefelling in the Juneau Creek area.  The Juneau project area contains a mosaic of single-storied, mid-aged aspen interspersed with young to mid-aged spruce with small pockets of willow and alder. There is a concern that overall age class diversity within the aspen is lacking, and that in the continued absence of disturbance, spruce/hemlock encroachment will eventually eliminate the aspen within the area.  The purpose of this project is to develop age class diversity within the current quaking aspen complex for wildlife habitat improvement in the Juneau Creek area, located about three miles northwest of Cooper Landing. OBJECTIVES  Reduce dead spruce fuel created by the spruce bark beetle.  Modify fuel loading as specified to facilitate future prescribed burn. Construct fireline as specified around the prescribed burn unit.
SCOPE
The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) and supplies to perform pre-felling work and fireline construction necessary to facilitate the Juneau Creek prescribed burn on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest.  The work consists of tree felling, lop and scatter of felled trees and slash, and fireline construction.

The specific goals are:  (1) To evaluate the effect of boot weight, height, and material (rubber vs. leather) on firefighter’s oxygen consumption, joint loading, dynamic balance, and gait characteristics; and (2) To provide much needed scientific data for NFPA 1971 standards committee (Protective Ensemble for Structural Fire Fighting) to revise and update standards.  In order to measure oxygen consumption while subjects perform a range of simulated firefighting tasks, the measurement system must weigh no more than 2 pounds so that it does not increase the energy expenditure of the wearer, and must be telemetry based so that the wearer’s movement is not limited by a hard-wired connection.   This is not a request for quotations and no solicitation is available. This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside. Firms that believe they can provide the equipment should identify themselves and give written qualification/capabilities to provide a comparable product.  This information must be submitted to the Contracting Officer with 15 days of the publication date of this synopsis.  Reference #000HCCB7-2005-21334.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to jmh8@cdc.gov or by fax to Jenny Bayer @ (513)533-8283.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  The R&D Contracting Office, Det 1 AFRL/PKMT is contemplating the award of a cost contract to Dynamics Research Corporation, 60 Frontage Road, Andover, MA 01810-5498 for the program entitled “WR-ALC Maintenance Operation Support (MOS) Simulation Model” under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source.”  The objective of this acquisition is to provide a technical solution through the development and application of an analytical model that addresses simulation of the facility, aircraft, manpower, and equipment configuration for maintenance at WR-ALC.  The solution will utilize data from the Air Force’s GO19 / PDMSS system, loading the required subset of data directly into an automated model for initialization.  The model will be configured such that the impacts of workload changes can be quantified in terms of the impact to aircraft flowdays and overtime requirements.  The model will allow for a full range of scenarios to be simulated and analyzed.  The model will allow the user to determine the sensitivity of current and proposed industrial processes and workflow to system input factors.  The resources to be tracked as simulated aircraft flow through the model are major skills, facilities, major parts, and overtime for the F-15 as a single unit and for the C-130, C-5, and C-17 aircraft systems as a combined operation.  The model will output statistical or other reports as required that validate and verify the model’s accuracy, test its assumptions and distributions, and compare the results of multiple runs.  The contractors will be awarded a single contract for $869K.  Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level.  Inquiries pertaining to this acquisition should be addressed to Timothy J.

<DESC>The Military Sealift Command (MSC) will be holding a pre-market survey/pre-proposal meeting to discuss an upcoming requirement for a "warehouse" vessel/afloat distribution center in support of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  The meeting will be held on 08 June 2005 from 0800-1200 hours at MSC headquarters in Washington D.C. and will be an open discussion between MSC, the requiring agency, and private industry.  A formal market survey will be issued following the meeting. 

If you are interested in attending this meeting please contact Veronica Holzer by noon on 06 June 2005 at (202)685-5507 or by email at veronica.holzer@navy.mil.  The following paragraph summarizes the intended mission for the vessel(s).     

MISSION:    The "warehouse vessel" is envisioned as an afloat distribution center platform, capable of carrying containers, pallets and shelf stock items and distributing and regenerating items.  The range of stock will be based on high demand items identified for use in early deployment of operating forces and for sustainment of forces in remote areas.  The activities on the platform will be receipt, stowage and issuance of these items, similar to shore-based DLA distribution centers (warehouses), though alternate methods of carrying and distribution will be considered for this survey.  In performing this mission the contractor would provide a time-chartered vessel, and the Government  will provide managed government or contractor personnel to operate the warehouse distribution functions.  The ship will be located in overseas areas, stocked with required items and ready to transit on immediate orders to an area to provide stock support to deployed troops.  The ship may be berthed in an austere port  or offshore.  Transfer operations may be conducted by means of ramp to pier, Lo/Lo to pier or surface connectors and VERTREP.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY AND NOT/NOT A SOLICITATION. THE RFI IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING INDUSTRY COMMENTS ON HOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN SATISFY ITS NEEDS; ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES; TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND RISK; THE IDENTIFICATION OF COST DRIVERS; AND SUGGESTIONS ON WAYS TO ENHANCE OR SUSTAIN COMPETITION.

The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage diplomatic tax relief in the United States.  

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of tax reclamation services initiated through the use of a provider issued “tax-exempt” credit or debit card to foreign missions and their eligible personnel.  The U.S. government will not/not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not/not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards in any fashion. All risk in extending credit will fall on the issuing company. 

OFM envisions the use of a credit/debit card-based system for facilitating the government’s diplomatic tax relief obligations.  This credit/debit card will serve as the only means a foreign mission or member would have in obtaining diplomatic tax relief on standard purchases.   Therefore, OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

There are roughly 15,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  The National Capital Planning Commission estimates the annual consumer spending of foreign missions and their members in the Washington Metropolitan Region (DC, MD, VA) as $290 million.   This figure does not include the annual spending of foreign missions in other states with high concentrations of foreign missions, such as New York, California, Florida and Texas.

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of foreign missions and international organizations as well as the accounts of their members to the banks participating in this program.  Therefore, providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided “tax-exempt” gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the providers of the “tax-exempt” gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the “tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.   

This Request for Information not only offers the opportunity for proposers to present a solution to OFM’s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State’s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all proposers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government’s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government’s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters’ Agreement.  

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.   Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host country.

Proposers should refer to the OFM website at http://www.state.gov/ofm/ and the Department of State website at www.state.gov for information about the OFM mission, organization, customer services, and current initiatives.

<DESC>There has been extensive research on factors contributing to economic growth among states in the U.S. The contributions of entrepreneurship to this economic development have received increasing attention by development officials in the states.  However, no research has been conducted to define and quantify the relationship between the dynamics of entrepreneurship and economic growth. The Office of Advocacy, in cooperation with Bureau of Census, has developed several important measures of small business activity (e.g., the number of businesses and establishments, their employment, the number of births and deaths of businesses and establishments, and their employment changes).  The Office of Advocacy seeks research proposals to utilize this data to conduct a detailed investigation of the interactions between small business activity variables and those economic and policy variables used in state and regional economic growth models to establish a better understanding of the role entrepreneurship plays in regional economic development in the U.S.  Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- ESTIMATING THE FLOW OF INVESTMENT BY ANGEL OR INFORMAL INVESTORS A STUDY OF METHODOLOGY
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-05-Q-0019
<RESPDATE>062405
<ARCHDATE>07092005
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>The Office of Advocacy seeks proposals on how best to produce data on angel investment. The following background information serves as the motivation for soliciting proposals on this topic.
1.Informal capital has been important in financing the growth of innovative startups in the U.S. It has become even more important during the past several years after the collapse of the IPO and the venture capital markets. During 2001 through 2003, speculation was that informal investors provided the only seed capital that was needed so much during that period.  
2.Statistical information about angels is limited. Information on angel investment, especially investment by angel capital networks, is becoming increasingly available as a result of efforts by the Kauffman Foundation.  Moreover, recent efforts to provide estimates of angel investment have accomplished much. However, two major studies, one by Jeffrey Sohl of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire  and another by William Bygrave of Babson College in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s 2003 Global Report on Venture Capital provided substantially different estimates (e.g., around $100 billion for one estimate versus $15 to $20 billion in the other estimate). 3.Since angel investing is engaged by the general population, it would be more economical to identify informal investors for survey purposes through special statistical approaches.  For instance, it would be very costly to adopt the method used in an earlier Advocacy project on informal investors during the early 1980s and the approach used by the GEM program.  It is a challenge to identify informal investors for statistical surveys of their investment activity.Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>In the last fifteen years, the share of output in the manufacturing sector has declined from 27.7 percent to 19.8 percent (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis).  Also in the last decade and a half, the static large firm (more than 500 employees) employment in manufacturing has dropped much more rapidly than small firm employment, declines of 3.7 million and 1.1 million, respectively.  The number of manufacturing firms had similar declines with large firm counts dropping by 11.7 percent and small firm counts dropping by 7.5 percent (U.S. Census Bureau, Statistics of U.S. Business).The Office of Advocacy seeks research to study changes in manufacturing in the last few decades as they impact the small business sector.  Possible research directions include but are not limited to focusing on the changing economies of scale in manufacturing (specialized mini-mills vs. big plants), researching a shift in shares of sub-industries in manufacturing and studying large firms’ outsourcing plants overseas. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- ANALYSIS OF FIRM MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
<SOLNBR>SBAHQ-05-Q-0022
<RESPDATE>062405
<ARCHDATE>07092005
<CONTACT>Billy Jenkins, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 205-7077, Fax (202) 481-0487, Email billy.jenkins@sba.gov
<DESC>In the past few years, there has been rapid firm merger and acquisition activity in the United States, and little has been done to capture and understand the effects of this activity on small and large businesses.  Therefore, an update and further examination is needed to the Mergers and Acquisition in the United States,  1990-1994, originally completed by Alicia Robb and Catherine Armington in October  1998 (see: ://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/m_a.pdf ). The effects of such activity on businesses differed depending on the size of the firm; for example, small firms involved in acquisition activity generated much more employment than those in large firms, according the earlier analysis. The Office of Advocacy is interested in understanding the rate at which small businesses acquire other firms or are being acquired by larger firms.  It is also interested in the level of job creation and/or destruction. Industries prone to mergers and acquisitions should be identified. It would be worthwhile to examine the differences in acquisition or merger rates across states or regions, and how these differences correlate with state economic growth rates. To conduct this research the researcher would need to identify database(s) and methods appropriate for the analysis. Questions and answers for this procurement shall commence on May 30, 2005 and end on June 7, 2005.  No questions after June 7, 2005.  Questions MUST be email to the Contracting officer (billy.jenkins@sba.gov).  Fax proposals will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification is to answer IDE provider questions.



1.	The United States Postal Service (USPS) operates a corporate website, www.usps.com, as its primary internet channel.  USPS.com provides consumers and businesses with 24-hour access to Po
1.	Q.  How is testing of USPS websites performed?

A.	Focus groups, usability labs, user behavior analysis from site metrics, and customer acceptance testing for new functional applications.


2.	Q.  Would USPS benefit from having testing of their websites conducted on a regular basis and results of this testing be used to create future development requirements? 

A.	Yes, on a regular and ad-hoc basis. Continuous measurement of user behavior is required. Testing must be focused and actionable.


3.	Q. Would the USPS be interested in having a software testing company provide input on a separate testing or V&V effort for USPS websites?

A.	V&V is undefined. Third party testing from a subcontractor is acceptable as long as it does not require that the USPS invest in particular software to perform the V&V.  
 
4.	Reference:  Section 2.2.3 Task #3:  Manage Promotion Planning & Affiliates/Alliance Programs

Description	USPS requires the IDE provider(s) to manage advertising space throughout the site, using existing ad server tool. The ad server tool generates banners and monitors its performance.
In addition, the IDE provider(s) shall manage the Affiliates & Alliance program to enhance revenue opportunities and seek opportunities to leverage our brand and assets in order to create new products and services with minimal investment.
Inputs	Direction of USPS Program Manager or his/her designee 
USPS Standards & Guidelines
Time Frame	Duration of task order
Deliverables	Deliverable #10:  Banner Placement Schedule 
(Due Monthly) – include estimated duration to complete initiative 

Q.	Clarification:  Given that the deliverable is the “Banner Placement Schedule”, can the vendor assume that this task excludes the need for the vendor to seek opportunities and manage relationships with advertisers?

A.	No, both internal and external business drivers may be involved. Banner placement primarily relates to banners on USPS online properties however both Affiliate and Merchant affiliate banner placements on and off Postal properties may be required.
5.	Reference:  Section 4.3 Key Personnel Resumes, Paragraph 3, “Incumbents assigned to the key personnel positions below, should be full-time employees.”
Q.  Clarification:  What are the key personnel positions? 
A.  Key personnel are individuals defined as being critical to the successful performance of task activities.

6.	Reference:  Section 2.2.2, Task #1:  Research, Develop and Deliver Web Strategy
Q.  Clarification:  With regard to the Internet Channel Strategic Plan 1, 3 and 5 year outlook, does USPS have possession of these documents, or are these new documents that USPS would want developed starting from the signing of the contract?

A.	 These would be new documents that USPS would like developed once the contract has been awarded.

7.	Reference:  Section 2.2.4, Task #4:  Establish and Maintain Extranet Website
Q.  Clarification:  The vendor assumes that this task requires the IDE provider to establish and host a web site. Does this site currently exist? If so, what is the hardware configuration? Since the requirements state that only the physical environment needs to be created, would the code be available for installation at the new IDE provider’s location? If this assumption is not true, does USPS expect the IDE provider to develop the site?

A.	The extranet site does not exist outside of the current proprietary site provided by the current provider. The USPS expects the IDE provider awarded contract to create, host, and maintain the extranet site for use as a limited program central reference site. The provider may select the platform and tools as long as the result is usable and accessible from the Postal environment.

8.	Reference:  Section 2.3.1, Task #5:  Conduct Site Engineering, Design, and Information Architecture Services
Q.  Clarification:  Do any of the deliverables requested in this task exist in some form today or will they need to be developed from scratch?

A.	Yes, they exist today however this does not prevent the selected provider from developing new/better formats and deliverables with agreement from the USPS program office. 


9.	Q.  Section 3.2.1 Staffing, indicates Key Personnel are defined as personnel assigned to the labor categories that the USPS has designated as essential to the work to be performed.  Section 4.3, Key Personnel Resumes, only specifically identifies the Program Manager and Technical Lead labor categories.  Is it correct to interpret this to mean that the Program Manager and Technical Lead are the only two key personnel labor categories for this procurement?

A.	No, please see answer to question 5 and the charts following question 33.


10.	Q.  Please confirm that a vendor would not be deemed non-compliant if they only responded to a portion of the proposal (e.g. Task group A only).  USPS indicates that they would like to award all tasks to a single IDE provider, but reserve the right to award each task group separately.

A.	Confirmed.

11.	Q.  Several tasks (e.g. tasks 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), are dependant on the number of new Internet Channel initiatives/efforts undertaken in a given year – In order to support pricing of these tasks, please provide assumptions as to the number of individual initiatives per year.

A.	A good estimate would be approximately 40-50 website initiatives annually.

12.	Q.  Would USPS consider a 3-week extension in order to allow sufficient time to compile pricing information (based on the USPS response to the question regarding the number of new initiatives/efforts that the Internet Channel completes in a given year)?

A.	The deadline will not be extended.

13.	Q.  Can you provide current staffing levels by labor category for the past 2 years what would fall within the solicitation’s scope of work and further, estimate growth by year over the period of performance?
A.  Please see the charts following question 33.
14.	Q.  Can you provide the most recent customer satisfaction metrics and trends for USPS.com? 
A.	No. Customer satisfaction will be discussed with the selected provider(s) post-award. 
15.	Q.  Can you provide some background metrics on the revenue by business area that is driven directly by USPS.com? 
A.	No. USPS.com supports the corporate strategic plans. The corporate web site is expected to generate direct sales revenue and produce opportunities for operational cost savings.  Additional metrics will be discussed with the successful provider post-award.

16.	Q.  Can you provide the most recent weekly or monthly project status report from the incumbent? 
A.	No. This information is proprietary and will be provided and discussed with the selected provider(s) post-award.

17.	Q.  Does USPS expect to select and award to a single provider for each Lot?
A.	If “Lot” is synonymous with “Task Groups”, the USPS prefers to make award to a single provider given that the selected provider(s) strengths, demonstrates the best value. Based on industry knowledge and market research, USPS anticipates that it may be necessary to award to multiple providers.

18.	Q.  Page 6 – Section 2.2.2 - Task #1 - Five deliverables are listed. If this contract is awarded to a competitor other than the incumbent is it the expectation of the USPS that completely new work products be developed to replace/update what you currently have? If it is your intention to handle more as a continuum can you share copies of the existing Trend & Forecast Report, Internet Strategic Plans (1, 3 and 5 year outlook)? Are there documented training materials in place? If so can you share an example?

A.	Existing past deliverables, templates, and source documents would be provided to selected providers after award to create consistency. There are no training materials in place. The selected provider will be expected to continuously provide input and recommendations to update these deliverables. 

19.	Q.  Page 8 – Section 2.2.3 - Task 3 - Is USPS hoping to increase their use of ads on the site, or are they comfortable with the current amount?  How do you refer to your internal businesses that advertise (e.g., Click-N-Ship)? Can you supply a copy of the current Ad Server reports so that we may gauge how deeply the applications capabilities are being utilized to USPS' benefit?

A.	“Ads” can be further defined to include short term or topical notices about products or services within the relevant content. Internal business drivers need to announce product and service enhancements or to create contextual cross-sales. The amount of “ad” information is not relevant; placement considerations must be based on relevancy, space availability, and page functionality. Ad Server reporting will not be shared prior to award. The selected provider will be encouraged to suggest changes to the use of “ads” to improve usability, and the value of the available “ad” space in general.






20.	Q.  Page 9 – Section 2.3.1 , Item #2 in Description - How does USPS distinguish between the "information architecture" and "content information architecture?"

A.	For the sake of this request, they are one and the same. The terms are meant to describe the relative position of information within the site’s hierarchical page structure as well as on individual pages and/or content pieces.

21.	Q.  Page 9 – Section 2.3.1 , Item #2 in Description - Can USPS be more specific about what they mean when they refer to "enable a segmented version of the site'?

A.	Segmentation represents how the internal channel groups divide/segment its customers.  They can be categorized into certain ‘buckets’.  Further detail and clarification will be discussed with the selected provider post-award.

22.	Q.  Page 11 - Deliverable #21 - What does the term "Copy Deck?" mean? 

A.	A “Copy Deck” is the pre-proofed copy suggested by a copy writer for a particular item (web pages, banner ads, pop-ups etc.) where textual copy will be used. For example; if a section of related content is proposed as a content area on a web site, the “copy deck” would include all the written text for that section and would serve as the basis for the text used in production.  

23.	Q.  Page 11 - Item #2 - Can USPS be more specific about the desired format of the "multiple prototypes."  Are they to static, HTML? Flash?, etc.

A.	The form of the prototype will be determined by the functional need of the prototype. All the suggested formats may be used from time to time.

24.	Q.  Page 8 – Section 2.2.3 Task #3 - Please define the term "Affiliates."  What business entities and relationships are included in the "Affiliates" of USPS.com?  What is the difference between an "Affiliate" and an "Alliance"?

A.	From the perspective of the USPS, the USPS has an “Affiliate” relationship with a third party if they link-in to a USPS online property. In some cases, these relationships require legal agreements. If a third party is placed within the USPS content, the third party is a “Merchant” affiliate to the USPS. Affiliate relationships may or may not include an exchange of value between the parties. 
B.	Affiliate relationships are largely tactical whereas Alliance relationships are more complicated and synergistic with the core capabilities and offerings of both parties. The program management offices for USPS.com will mostly enable Strategic Alliances vs. manage the business aspects of them.

 
25.	Q.  How many pages of content are included in USPS.com? How many are contained in the 2.5 version and how many in 2.7? Do you anticipate migrating the 2.5 pages into the newer version?  What percentage of the total page count gets most of the hits?

A.	USPS.com consists of over 250,000 pages with approximately 55% receiving the most traffic (give or take with advertising).  The breakdown of pages and direction in terms of version will be discussed with the selected provider post-award.

26.	Q.  Will USPS consider an extension to the proposal due date if answers are not provided by May 20th?

A.	No, as all questions will be answered by May 20th.

27.	Q.  Transition activities.  There are deliverables identified that appear to be worded as tasks for the incumbent, is it USPS expectation that a successful new contractor would include only the time anticipated for turnover/training received from the incumbent?

A	Yes


28.	Q.  Can USPS provide information, data and/or reports concerning the following areas:
a) Existing requirements, use cases or key user scenarios
b) Results and feedback from previous user research, surveys and usability testing

A.	No. These documents will be discussed with the selected provider post-award.

29.	Q.  Please clarify if USPS will designate certain labor categories as key personnel as defined in Section 3.2.1 as those categories that are “essential to the work to be performed” – or if suppliers are to identify certain personnel bid to be classified as key personnel? 

A. Please see the answer to question 5 and the charts following question 33.	

30.	Q.  In Section 4.2, please clarify what is meant by the requirement “Respondents shall list the title of each type of position (labor category), under one of these six labor groupings, that may be used if a competitor’s solution is selected.”  Also please clarify what is meant by the statement “that may be used if a competitor’s solution is selected”?


A.  Please see the answer to question 5 and the charts following question 33.	


31.	Q.  We are unclear about the relationship between the six Labor Groups identified in Section 4.2 vs. the use of these Labor Groups in the Pricing Spreadsheet.  Are Labor Groups the same as a supplier’s labor category?  For example, when bidding a Program Manager do we include the title “Program Manager” in the Pricing Spreadsheet – or “Labor Group I” under the column titled labor category?

A.  You would need to include both the Labor Category and the Title (i.e. Labor Group 2, Program Manager)	

32.	Q.  How many FTEs or labor hours per year is USPS currently procuring under the existing IDE & Support Services contract?    

A.  Approximately 22 FTE’s	

33.	Q.  Will USPS provide a set Level of Effort for the overall program – or at least the three lots to be used for bidding during the Reverse Auction, to establish an apples to apples comparison of pricing?  Also, can you further clarify how suppliers are to provide specific pricing by deliverable given that many aspects of the SOW are broad and undefined?  

A.	First, price breakdown must be calculated by each deliverable.  Below are charts of labor categories by task groups:


Labor Category Charts:

Task A: Internet Website Strategic/Tactical Planning, Program Mgt & Business Team Leads

34.	Q.  In 4.2 and 4.3 "Incumbent" or "Incumbents" is used several times.  Does this really mean "Position Holder" or "Position Holders"? 
A.  Yes, Position Holder or Position Holders.

35.	Q.  The solicitation due date is given on the solicitation cover page as “05/31/2005 0900 ES”.  RFP section 4.1 says “Deadline for electronic submission is no later than 3pm on Friday, May 31, 2005.” As May 31, 2005 is a Tuesday, is the solicitation response due at 3pm on Tuesday, May 31? 
A.  The technical and cost proposals are due on Tuesday May 31, 2005 by 9:00 A.M. EST.

36.	Q.  RFP Section 4.1 discusses the deadline for electronic submission, but identifies where hard copy should be sent. Is electronic submission alone compliant, or is hard copy also required? 
A.  One electronic copy shall be sent to donald.w.hadle@usps.gov
One hard copy shall be sent to: 
Donald Hadley
475 L’Enfant Plaza SW
Room 4541 
Washington DC 20260-4541


37.	Q.  What is the granularity of the reverse auction bidding? Is it at the group (lot) level only? Is it at the task level? Is it at the deliverable level? 
A.  Group Level 
38.	Q.  Does reverse auction bidding contain only total dollars, dollars and hours, or all of the data contained in the deliverable tables?
A.  Upon selection of top-rated technically-acceptable offers, opening bid was contain only total dollar value. 
39.	Q.  During the reverse auction is the lowest bid for each bidder visible? 
A.  During auction, bids & bid values are not visible to the participants.  Only the respective ranking (#1, #2,...) is seen.
40.	Q.  During the reverse auction can a bidder (e.g. bidder #1) make a new bid that is lower than bidder #1's current bid, but is not lower than the lowest (say bidder #2's) current bid? 
A.  Within the allotted time for the auction, any participant can make a new bid that might impact the ranking of offers.  
41.	Q.  There appear to be two deliverables numbered 41. Is one of them 42? 
A.  The pricing template incorrectly states, Deliverables #41: Reference materials needed for shadowing/on-the-job training defined below.  This should be, Deliverables #42: Reference materials needed for shadowing/on-the-job training defined below.
42.	Q.  Are the two requested resumes in addition to the 40 page limit for the technical proposal? 
A.  The two resumes are excluded from the 40 page technical proposal.
43.	Q.  Please confirm that the past performance references are not included in the 40 page count.
A.  Past Performance references are excluded for the 40 page technical proposal
44.	Q.  Please confirm that the organizational capability is not included in the 40 page count.
A.  Organizational capability is excluded form the 40 page technical proposal.
45.	Q.  Please confirm that the total page count of 40 pages is for all three groupings of tasks.
A.  The 40 pages are for the 42 deliverables in section 2 of the statement of work.
46.	Reference:  Section 4.3 Key Personnel Resumes, Paragraph 3, “Also, for security clearance purposes, these incumbents and all other competitor employees who may perform tasks on USPS facilities or using USPS sensitive data, shall have been classified as U.S. citizens for a minimum period of the most recent 5 years.”
Q.  Clarification:  Please clarify which personnel are required to have been classified as U.S. citizens for a minimum period of the most recent 5 years.

A.  Citizenship requirement applies to all personnel who will be accessing USPS facilities and/or network infrastructure.
Q.  Clarification:  Would USPS accept a key personnel supplied by a vendor that has been a U.S. citizen for the most recent 4.5 years and has possessed the USPS Sensitive Security Clearance since March 2001?

A.  This acceptance is the purview of the USPS Corporate Security office.  
47.	Q.  When does the incumbent’s current contract expire? 
A.  September 30, 2005
48.	Q.  Once the USPS has evaluated and selected the 10 highest-rated and technically-capable offers will the USPS publish this list?
A.  Yes
49.	Q.  There are two different sections each numbered 2.2.2 - but there is no 2.2.1. To keep the numbering consistent with the USPS SOW, would USPS prefer suppliers to continue to use the numbering as they have it, or update our response: the new 2.2.1 would refer to Task 1; the second instance of  2.2.2 would continue to refer to Task 2.

A.  2.2.2 Task #1 – Research, Develop, and Deliver Web Strategy is numbered incorrectly the correct number should be 2.2.1 Task #1 – Research, Develop, and Deliver Web Strategy is numbered


50.	Q.  In Section 6.1, USPS outlines its process for conducting an anonymous Reverse Auction.  Will participants be able to view other bidders prices – while keeping the bidders blind?  Given the nature of this program, we believe it would be very difficult to participate in a Reverse Auction without having access to all prices bid.   

A.  Neither bidders nor their pricing will be visible during the auction.  Only the ranking position of each offer will be seen.

51.	Q.  In Section 6.4, USPS identifies three lots (Groups A, B & C) to be used for bidding during the Reverse Auction.  Each lot includes the cost associated with the “transition tasks”.  Isn’t it unfair to include transition cost in the Reverse Auction, as this gives the incumbent a clear advantage (by bidding $0 transition costs) over other suppliers?  Would USPS consider excluding transition costs from the Reverse Auction? 

A.  USPS does not intend to exclude transition costs from the Reverse Auction since determining factor for selection shall be best value; not just lowest price.

52.	Q.  Does USPS intend to award a T&M contract?  

A.  The USPS intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract and write either Firm-fixed cost or Time and Material Delivery order under the master contract.
53.	Q.  Will USPS identify the incumbent?

A.  No

<DESC>*************UPDATE****************************UPDATE*************************** Amendment 01 has been added along with Addendum 01 for 030032 and Addendum 01  for 030032A********************************************************************* *****UPDATE: QUESTIONS/ANSWERS********************  1) Is there a separate solicitation that will be put out for furnishing the  safety inspection and operating permit issuance for the boilers and any air  tanks?  2) If there is not a current contract or solicitation for the safety  inspections and permit issuance, do you know who the contact at the facility  would be to look into that? A:The required internal and external boiler inspections for the base are  handled through Air Force Headquarters by a separate contract.  Wright- Patterson AFB is not involved in the contract process, the arrangements are  made by Air Force Headquarters.  Any inspections that are needed for this  project will be handled through the contract that is already in place.  If the  contractor wants to get involved with boiler inspections for the Air Force  sites it is probably best if he contacts the Air Force Headquarters directly.   I would imagine that there is a solicitation from Headquarters when the boiler  inspection contract is bid. *******UPDATE********Site Visit Attendance has been uploaded******UPDATE******** ********UPDATE****************UPDATE********************UPDATE****************** Revised solicitation has been added containing site visit  information***********  4 May 05  at 9:30, Bldg   770*****************************Register by contacting Kerry Smith*************  *************UPDATE*****UPDATE*********************SOLICITATION, DRAWING AND  SPECIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN UPLOADED  26  APRIL  2005****************************** DESC: PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.

<DESC>USAID/Washington (hereinafter to as USAID) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to provide recruitment, employment, and backstopping of Technical Advisors in AIDS, Child Survival, Infectious Diseases, Population and Basic Education (hereafter abbreviated TAACS) as authorized in the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act FY 87 to assist USAID in the implementation of priority programs in the health, HIV/AIDS, nutrition, population and basic education sectors.  

The RFP will be issued/posted on USAID’s agency website: www.fedbizops.gov under the section on business and procurement on or about February 03, 2005.

Background information follows:

The TAACS Program is managed by the Bureau for Global Health (GH), and is currently providing 69 TAACS to the Agency, approximately half of whom are serving with overseas Missions.  Because the TAACS mechanism is a major Agency resource, providing staff with direct-hire authorities to carry out the Agency’s key programs, a TAACS contract that provides strong recruitment and backstopping support is essential to the Agency’s effectiveness, particularly to Basic Education and the Expanded Response in HIV-AIDS and Infectious Diseases.  

The Contractor shall reliably and efficiently complete tasks for recruitment, hiring and placement, training, backstopping, supervising, and evaluating TAACS, who will provide long term technical and managerial assistance to USAID overseas and to various technical offices in USAID/Washington. They will work in the design, management, implementation and evaluation of child survival, HIV/AIDS, infectious diseases, population and basic education activities. Upon selection, the Contractor will employ them as employees of the Contractor’s organization while the TAACS provide technical advice and management capabilities to the USAID Offices and Missions.

The USAID TAACS Program Coordinator, Cognizant Technical Officer (CTO) and the Contract Director shall undertake appropriate coordination with other USAID offices, bureaus, and Missions with respect to the Agency guidance on Technical Advisors in AIDS and Child Survival, as contained in USAID Automated Directives System (ADS) Series 200, References.

A list of prospective bidders will be provided in the solicitation.  Please send written requests to sjohnson@usaid to be included on the bidder's list.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) has revised its approach to procuring a Consolidated Financial System.  PBGCs updated requirements are as follows:

The PBGC desires to contract for (1)  the design, development, testing, and implementation of a single Oracle instance (with possibly multiple sets of ledgers) system and (2)  a business process re-engineering effort associated with the financial accounting system processes, subsidiary interfaces and non-core systems.  

The first phase will include work on PBGCs General Ledgers.  The current financial and accounting programs use three general ledgers: the Revolving Fund, the Trust Fund and Financial Reporting.  These three General Ledgers utilize three different financial systems: the Financial Reporting System, Performance Accounting System (governmental accounting) and Trust Accounting System (non-governmental accounting), which rely heavily on manual processes to capture and maintain much of its data.     PBGC’s goal is to consolidate the three general ledgers into one Oracle instance (with possibly multiple sets of books) plus implement the Oracle Accounts Payable module.  It is anticipated that this phase will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis.

The second phase will include conducting a business processing re-engineering effort.  The goal of the BPR effort is to re-engineer the business processes related to the Revolving Fund, Trust Fund and Financial Reporting whose activities are recorded in the general ledgers and interfaces with subsidiary and non-core systems to deliver functional requirements related to the re-engineered business processes and to assist with writing a Statement of Work (SOW).  The system solution will utilize Oracle Federal Financials 11i or higher, including, but not limited to, the General Ledger, Accounts Payable and the Accounts Receivable modules  It is anticipated that this phase will be awarded on a cost reimbursable basis.  The vendor awarded this contract will be precluded from competing on the implementation of a follow-on contract to implement the results of the BPR.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about June 15, 2005 with award of a contract projected before the end of fiscal year 2005.    A pre-proposal conference is tentatively scheduled for the week of June 20, 2005 (date/time to be determined).  The conference will be held at PBGCs facility at 1200 K Street, NW, Washington, D.C.  20005.  Vendors desiring to attend this conference are requested to contact Mr. Greg Smith by email at "Smith.Gregory@pbgc.gov" with company name and name of attendees.

<DESC>NOTICE OF UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL.  The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Arizona Department of Health Services, Phoenix, AZ  85007.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct a pilot test in which dental hygienists function as case workers to track referral and treatment for comprehensive oral health care for Head Start Children.  The contractor will share their data on the effectiveness of implementing the Head Start Triage System for Early Head Start Children age’s zero to three, their implementation manuals for the program, and their findings. Because the program is based on an unsolicited proposal, which the Government has determined  to be an unique and innovative approach that was independently originated and developed by the offeror; without the Government’s supervision; benefits the Agency’s mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement, the Arizona Department of Health Services is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) A, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (i)(A).  The Contractor has spent a substantial amount of effort in developing the pilot and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial variety of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  The anticipated period of performance is for twelve (12) months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990. This announcement is for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  The reference number is #05-S240-0265(DLC).

<CONTACT>Steve Paschke, Business Specialist, Phone 208-526-1113, Fax 208-526-0876, Email sdp@inel.gov
<DESC>Researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory have developed and patented a technology that emulates a natural process in which water contaminated with metal sulfates flows into wetlands where naturally occurring bacteria reduce and precipitate the contaminants, and raise the pH of these acidic streams to neutral.  The process is cost-effective, efficient, and practical.  INL scientists have tested the process in the laboratory from acid rock drainage from copper, cobalt, and iron mines.  Results have shown that the process effectively removes up to 99% of the metals from the water.  The process can be designed to handle high flow rates.  INL researchers estimate that the combined capital and operating costs can be as low as one-third of those for lime treatment and the sludge produced is a fraction of that produced by liming.  

The researchers also stress that it can be used to remediate other streams that contain metals and sulfates, as well as streams containing selenate, nitrates, or other contaminants that can be microbially reduced.  Hence, the technology has a much wider range of application.     

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with some or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before July 29, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

<DESC>This is a request for information only.  Presently no solicitation package is available.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Lakehurst, is seeking sources that may be capable of providing a portable swaging tool for applying terminals to arresting gear cables aboard aircraft carriers.

The arresting gear system aboard aircraft carriers relies on a purchase cable to transfer the energy from the landing aircraft to the arresting gear engines located below the deck.  Each end of the purchase cable is fitted with a terminal.  The purchase cable terminal on the top, deck end connects to the cross deck pendant, which is engaged by the landing aircraft’s tailhook.  On the opposite end, the terminal connects the purchase cable to the arresting engine.  The purchase cable terminal is considered a critical safety item.  The failure of a terminal during an aircraft arrestment could result in the loss of life, the loss of an aircraft, or both.  After replacement (or “rereeve”) of the purchase cable, the sailors need to attach the terminal on the flight deck in order to connect the purchase cable with the cross deck pendant.  The current process, which requires the sailor to pour molten zinc into the socket terminal, is toxic, hazardous and time consuming.

The Navy is interested in a portable swaging tool that could be used to attach the terminal to the purchase cable.  It is important that the swaging device be able to apply enough force for a secure attachment that survives continuous arrestments throughout the cable’s service life, and yet be small and lightweight enough to be easily transported up to and around the carrier flight deck.  The wire arresting gear rope is 1 7/8 inch diameter, lang lay steel with a polyester core.  Breaking strength is 215,000 lbs, and operational life of the cable is 3000 cycles.  For terminal attachments at our shore-based facility, we use a linear - 3000 Ton swaging machine, and press our terminals starting at 1125 PSI (700 tons) up to 3535 PSI  (2200 tons).  

For solutions that are commercial-off-the-shelf, please provide a picture, unit cost, and specifications to include dimensions, weight, and pressing capacity (pounds per square inch).  For ideas that require development, please provide proposed concept/approach and work plan to include funding requested and milestones.  The response shall be in white paper (summary) format, no greater than five (5) pages, along with any supporting data/material, which shall not exceed a total of twenty-five (25) pages.  Paper submissions shall be sent to NAWC Contracts Dept, Attn: Jessica Schoenleber, Hwy 547,  Lakehurst, NJ 08733. Electronic submissions are preferred.  Electronic submissions shall be sent to jessica.schoenleber@navy.mil Subject line: Portable Swager RFI. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.    Responses should cite RFI number N68335-05-RFI-Swager and be addressed the attention of Ms. Jessica Schoenleber, Code 2.5.2.3.2.JS, jessica.schoenleber@navy.mil.  All responses are due by (4:00PM EST) on 22 June 2005

After replacement (or “rereeve”) of the purchase cable, the sailors need to attach the terminal on the flight deck in order to connect the purchase cable with the cross deck pendant.  The current process, which requires the sailor to pour molten zinc into the socket terminal, is toxic, hazardous and time consuming.

The Navy is interested in a portable swaging tool that could be used to attach the terminal to the purchase cable.  It is important that the swaging device be able to apply enough force for a secure attachment that survives continuous arrestments throughout the cable’s service life, and yet be small and lightweight enough to be easily transported up to and around the carrier flight deck.  The wire arresting gear rope is 1 7/8 inch diameter, lang lay steel with a polyester core.  Breaking strength is 215,000 lbs, and operational life of the cable is 3000 cycles.  For terminal attachments at our shore-based facility, we use a linear - 3000 Ton swaging machine, and press our terminals starting at 1125 PSI (700 tons) up to 3535 PSI  (2200 tons).  

For solutions that are commercial-off-the-shelf, please provide a picture, unit cost, and specifications to include dimensions, weight, and pressing capacity (pounds per square inch).  For ideas that require development, please provide proposed concept/approach and work plan to include funding requested and milestones.  The response shall be in white paper (summary) format, no greater than five (5) pages, along with any supporting data/material, which shall not exceed a total of twenty-five (25) pages.

<DESC>Request for Information for a "Grammar-Spell Check" solution. The Social Security Administration (SSA) Distributed Online Correspondence System (DOCS) is a client-server system used to send correspondence to beneficiaries/recipients notifying them of actions on their account. Currently there are approximately 40,000 employees with access to the system, and they produce approximately 17,000 notices per day. Notices are prepared in either English or Spanish. SSA plans to migrate to a mainframe-based Java application accessed on the SSA intranet. This will improve the capabilities of the system.  Employees will edit Universal Text Identifier (UTI) paragraphs in order to customize documents to individual situations. The agency is seeking a software solution for checking grammar and spelling while editing UTIs and documents to be sent to beneficiaries and recipients.
Requirements: All solutions proposed must be scaleable to the volume experienced by SSA. Consideration will be given to automated solutions that meet the Agency’s EITA criteria for sound architecture, i.e., non-proprietary (open) software components, hosting on standard hardware, a flexible user interface, 508 compliance and standard interface design. Solutions must be able to run on a mainframe (not a PC or client-server application). It must be capable of being used by a Java application accessed on the SSA intranet. The software must be capable of checking both the grammar and spelling of UTIs and documents simultaneously. The software must be capable of checking the grammar and spelling of UTIs and documents written in either English or Spanish (i.e. separate rules of grammar must be used for each language). Responses: Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency’s requirements. Vendors should provide the names and contact information of customers. We reserve the right to verify information with references. Vendors responding should indicate whether their products are available on the GSA Schedule.  Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Responses should be limited to 15 pages. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources. Although electronic responses are encouraged, any paper responses to this notice should be submitted in duplicate. All responses are due within 15 days of this publication and should refer to “Grammar-Spell Check”. Responses must be addressed to the following office:

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential manufacturers with extensive experience and facilities in place to produce Maintenance Self Testers (MST) for the M139 Volcano Mine Dispenser system. The purpose of the Market Survey is to locate manufacturing sources for the MST, National Stock Number 1095-01-259-3211 ARDEC part number 12553101. The Maintenance Self Tester (MST) is an electronic tool used for checking Dispenser Control Unit (DCU) of the Volcano Mine Dispenser System. The MST has circuitry to simulate a Volcano launcher rack with canisters and has built-in failures. When the MST is connected to a properly functioning Volcano DCU, the DCU detects and displays these built in failures when tested. The MST has an aluminum shell casing measuring approximately 15.5 in x 12 in x 8.5 in. The  shell houses the electronic testing assembly and a compartment that holds the MST Power Cable, MST Launcher Rack Cable, and MST Hand Control Unit Cable.  These cables are components of the MST that plug into connectors on the MST and  DCU. The estimated quantities of MSTs are eight over a period of twenty-five  weeks. This notice serves as a sources sought notice/market survey for  informational/ planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a formal  solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or pay for the information solicited. If a formal solicitation is generated at a  later date, a solicitation notice will be published. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. The Maintenance Self Testers (MST) contains critical technology (Distribution D), and only  qualified DOD contractors.  Interested, responsible sources are requested to  submit information on their companyâ€™s capabilities.  The response must provide documentation and descriptive literature showing experience with building the  Volcano MST and an extensive working knowledge of the Volcano Dispenser Control Unit or similar unit.

<SUBJECT>R -- Lead State in the Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance Systems Infrastructure Consortium
<DESC>This notice concerns a proposed SOLE-SOURCE award.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award, NON-COMPETITIVELY, to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), a task order Cooperative Agreement under which VDOT will serve for five years as the Lead State in the Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance (CICAS) Infrastructure Consortium (IC).  As the Lead State in the CICAS IC, VDOT will enter into agreements with other state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) and local agencies as necessary to accomplish the goals of the CICAS program.  As the Lead State, VDOT will be responsible for the distribution of federal funds to other CICAS IC partner agencies and for tracking the 20% federal match requirements for the CICAS IC.  Although VDOT’s work will be precisely defined only as individual Task Orders are hereafter issued under the Cooperative Agreement, it is now known that VDOT’s work will include the following:  (a) Program Management of all of the necessary work, travel, etc. to supervise the project as well as the interface and coordination efforts with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) stakeholder group; (b) System Design, including development of a concept of operations, functional design, performance requirements, and system design for cooperative intersection collision avoidance systems; (c) State Map Development, including development of the state map(s) component of the system; the state map is the repository of all of the information needed to define the condition of the intersection (e.g., geometric mapping, global positioning system correction data, traffic-signal controller state, and dynamic object data; (d) System Development, including development of prototype cooperative intersection collision avoidance systems for testing purposes, and system development for conducting field operations as well as testing early versions of the systems; (e) Human Factors, including the conducting of human factors related studies to develop recommendations for the driver interfaces for cooperative intersection collision avoidance systems; (f) Systems Evaluation, including integration and assessment of the utility of cooperative intersection collision avoidance systems;  (g) Engineering Demonstrations, including the conducting of such demonstrations of CICAS instrumented intersections; these engineering demonstrations will utilize test vehicles used for experimental procedures, and will be designed to illustrate system functionality, performance, robustness, and reliability to the DOT; (h) System Engineering Documentation, including documentation of the CICAS concept of operations, the system requirement specification, the system interface specification, the system design and infrastructure architecture; and (i) Outreach and Communication, including engaging the infrastructure stakeholder community on CICAS issues in order to make the system acceptable to the infrastructure owner/operator; this will involve developing briefings to groups such as the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, local and state DOTs, traffic control device suppliers and consultants, and developing brochures, trade press articles, and web site material to explain CICAS in terms that can be understood, as a potential part of the stakeholders’ toolbox of traffic engineering alternatives.  For the following reasons, it is believed that VDOT is the ONLY organization that is BOTH capable of, and interested in, performing this project:  (1) VDOT has participated in CICAS IC planning activities including meetings and teleconferences; (2) VDOT possesses capability and experience related to advanced research and development of cooperative intersection collision avoidance systems because VDOT currently participates in the U. S. Department of Transportation’s Intelligent Vehicle Initiative (IVI) Infrastructure Consortium, along with California DOT and Minnesota DOT; (3) At the present time the FHWA believes that there are only four state DOTs-----those of California, Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia----which possess needed experience with CICAS IC or with Intelligent Transportation Research, and which are ALSO committed to joining CICAS at this time; (4) Of the four states just mentioned, only Virginia DOT (VDOT) has shown its commitment to supply the additional resources necessary to take on the ADMINISTRATIVE duties associated with being the Lead State in the CICAS IC;  (4) In its role in the IVI Infrastructure Consortium, VDOT has demonstrated its technical leadership and commitment to developing intersection collision avoidance systems; (5) VDOT has proven through its research, development, and demonstration of technology that its cooperative intersection violation warning system, a major component of the CICAS program, is by far the most advanced in the country; (6) Under the IVI Infrastructure Consortium, VDOT has shown its ability to commit staff time and other resources necessary to manage the program; (7) VDOT has also demonstrated its capability to work with automobile Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) through the joint development of a cooperative intersection violation warning system with automatic vehicle braking that is singular among state DOTs; and (8) VDOT’s technical leadership in intersection collision avoidance systems and its commitment of the necessary resources to act as the Lead State makes VDOT the only choice for Lead State in the CICAS IC.   HOWEVER, any interested organization (other than VDOT) that believes it can clearly and convincingly DEMONSTRATE its complete capability to serve as the Lead State in this CICAS IC project shall, not later than June 8, 2005, submit a Statement of Qualifications to Mr. James Mowery at the following address:  Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S.

You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your  ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.

The details of this arrangement are listed in clause SMC H006 of the Model Contract.  Potential Offerors having objections to non-Government personnel participating in the evaluation of proposals and/or contract documentation including resultant contract administration activities shall contact the PCO prior to submitting their proposals.  

J.	BASIS FOR AWARD:  Contract award decisions, if any, will be based on an evaluation of which proposals or parts of proposals best further the Government objectives in the GPS OCX PRDA effort and on the availability of funding.  The Government intends to make multiple awards with one small business set-aside.  The selection of none, one, or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each Offeror’s proposal (both technical and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the GPS OCX PRDA.  Proposals are evaluated solely on the criteria published in this PRDA.  The proposals will be evaluated based on the following two criteria that are listed in descending order of importance.  No other evaluation criteria will be used.  Each criterion will be evaluated concurrently.


CRITERIA I

Mission Capability
The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated separately for both technical content and program management on how well the proposal will achieve the overall PRDA objectives.  The evaluation will focus on the understanding demonstrated and the effectiveness of the Offeror’s proposed solution for:

a.	Offeror’s understanding of the technical scope and approach in accomplishing the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
b.	Degree of innovation displayed (balanced by lessons learned, best practices, and proven technologies)
c.	Management approach to accomplish the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
d.	Approved subcontracting goals (as applicable)

CRITERIA II

Cost/Price: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Although an important discriminator, Mission Capability is significantly more important than Cost/Price.  The Offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and realistic.

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated concurrently.

The Evaluation Teams will produce and document findings that thoroughly identify and describe strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies associated with each Offeror’s proposal when evaluated against each evaluation criteria.  Any information or data incorporated by reference or referral will not be considered.

Mission Capability Technical Merit ratings will be rated: Outstanding – a significant or exceptional aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merit and exceeds expectations in a way beneficial to the Air Force and will be included in the contract or inherent in an Offeror’s process; Good – meets expectations; Marginal – aspect of or omission from proposal that may contribute to a failure in meeting specified minimum objectives; Unacceptable – materiel failure to meet objectives; or Unique – may not meet all Air Force objectives but offers a unique innovation that justifies special consideration.  Mission Capability  Program Management will be rated Acceptable – Yes or No. Cost/Price rating will be Reasonableness (“Yes” or “No”) and Realism (“Yes” or “No”).

K.	DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: The delivery address for proposals is: SMC/GPK (Attn: Carol Laechelt), Los Angeles Air Force Base, 2400 South Pacific Avenue, Building 410, Fort MacArthur, San Pedro CA 90731.  Personal delivery of proposals or delivery other than on 20 June 2005 shall be coordinated 24 hours in advance of the proposed due date/time with the PCO to ensure timely submission.  Complete proposals must be received by 1200 hours (noon) on Tuesday, 21 June 2005 Pacific Daylight Time.  Offerors shall pre-coordinate delivery time with either the PRDA PCO (Carol Laechelt) or the PRDA Deputy Program Manager (Capt Grant Leeds).

L.	AWARD NOTIFICATION: The PCO will notify Offerors whose proposals have not been selected for negotiation/award as soon as possible.  When a proposal is not selected for award, an Offeror may submit a written request for pre-award debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505(a).  Any post-award debriefing of Offerors shall be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.506.

M.	DATA RIGHTS:  The Government assumes that since this is research and development funded exclusively with government funds related to GPS OCX, all technical data developed or used in the course of this program are provided with unlimited rights.  All system architecture risks and associated risk assessments will be provided with unlimited rights.

Any assertions of technical data rights shall be made in Attachment 5 of the Model Contract in the form provided.

N.	PROGRAMMATICS:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear significant concerns from the Offeror or potential Offeror during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine questions, such as clarifications, are not considered “significant concerns” and shall be communicated directly to the PCO.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the PCO, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Col Roc Myers, (310) 363-1222.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis, identified as No. A1269905, is to notify contractors of the government’s intent to award a purchase order to Ciperson Consulting under the simplified acquisition procedures.  The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Ciperson Consulting, 3416 Colonial Court, Olney, MD 20832, as in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements due to the following reasons:  Ciperson Consulting has worked with FDA over the last several years and has unique knowledge of the Center programs and programs within OSB.  This knowledge was gained from the intimate involvement in these programs from the inception to the current status.  Organizational consulting requires intimate knowledge of the structure and functions of the organization, which Ciperson Consulting possesses.  However, other sources may submit descriptive literature that fully demonstrates their capabilities.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The associated NAICS code is 541612 – Human Resources and Executive Search Consulting Services and the small business size standard is $6M.  

The following is background information and the services Ciperson Consulting will be requested to provide:  Current events have placed FDA squarely in the spotlight of public scrutiny with the expectation that the agency will do everything within its power to ensure that the public is not threatened by problems with marketed drugs or medical devices. The Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB)-, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), is the organization primarily responsible for identifying, assessing, researching, and resolving potential public health problems related to medical and/or radiation emitting devices. In order to fulfill its public health expectations, OSB has reached out to other CDRH Offices to establish partnerships and improved practices that will enhance the approval and post market study processes. A series of work groups and resulting recommendations have established a collaborative climate within CDRH and have allowed OSB to take key leadership roles in this organizational improvement effort. With leadership, however, come greater demands on staff and managers to lead effectively, communicate clearly, and prioritize skillfully.

Statement of Work:  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work described below:
1. Provide expert consultation, facilitation, and active participation in the gathering of data and 
development of findings and recommendations to advance the process improvement efforts undertaken by 
OSB and CDRH.
2. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in identifying additional improvement opportunities that will 
enhance OSB's core businesses.
3. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in implementing new and improved processes and practices.
4. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in developing and 	enhancing the leadership skills and practices required to allow OSB to meet its expanding responsibilities.
5. Provide expert consultation and facilitation to assist OSB leadership in the (re)organization of resources and systems to ensure an efficient and effective structure to address expanding responsibilities.
6. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the "roll out" of new procedures.
7. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the monitoring and evaluating of new procedures.
8. Provide expert consultation and facilitation in the identification of new partnership opportunities to allow 
OSB to continue to expand its collaboration efforts.

<DESC>The Command and Control Engineering Center(C2CEN), USCG intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis with Tech Comm Inc, Sunrise, FL a commercial-off-the shelf test set for use on the TC-5025 Direction Finder System installed in 87 Foot WPB's. The specs are as follows:

TechComm TC-5025 ADF Test set Specifications

TC-2502 ADF Test Set: For use with Tech Comm, Inc.
TC-5025/USCG and TC-5025/CGA DF Processor includes 2-foot Interface Cable and carrying Case.

The TC-2502 Test Set is used as a diagnostic tool to isolate faults within the DF Processor / Receiver, Models TC-5025A/USCG or TC-5025/CGA and the mating Processor-to-Antenna interconnecting cable.  As a stand-alone device, limited diagnostics can also be performed for the companion TC-6526/USCG DF Antenna.  Additional diagnostic tests may be performed on the DF Antenna with the aid of a spectrum analyzer.

Through a combination of toggle switches and LED’s the TC-2502 Test Set will verify the switching of relays that control antenna band switching and antenna switchable amplifiers.  Integrity and functionality of Antenna drive lines (N,S,E,W) at the DF Processor are tested through the toggle switches and corresponding LED indicating ON or OFF.

The Test Set includes a short test cable for interface between the Test Set and the DF Processor / Receiver unit under test (UUT).  Tets may be performed on installed units by disconnecting the 40-foot interconnect cable from the DF Antenna and connecting the test set cable to the cable mast head.  Testing the DF Processor / Receiver unit in this manner also verifies the integrity of the installed interconnecting cable.  If a fault is detected, the test should be repeated using the short test cable to determine if the fault is at the DF Processor / receiver or in the 40-foot interconnect cable.

TC-2504 Loop-back Test set: For use with all Tech Comm, Inc.
DF Antenna Interconnect Cables includes Gender Changer and
carrying Case.

The TC-2504 Test Set may be used for simple loop-back tests of spare cables having connectors on both ends, before placing cables in inventory, for installation, or replacement of installed cables determined to be faulty.  The installed cable is a combined 40-foot male to male multi-wire control cable and separate coaxial cable.  A connector Gender-Changer is included for testing installed cables using an identical test cable or spare cable.  The Loop-Back tests are used to test only the power and data lines on the multi-pin connector cable assembly.  A Volt-Ohm-Meter (VOM) should be used to test the Coaxial cable center conductor and shield for continuity and / or shorts.

TC-6526/ACS Interconnect Cable 44-foot, use with TC-6526/USCG  
DF Antenna or Loop-back Test Set
Note 1.Cable to be supplied with connector installed on one end.  A mating connector assembly is supplied with the cable for local assembly.
Note 2.Cable to be supplied with connectors installed on both ends.

The TC-6526 Interconnect cable is used as a quick check for system operation to substitute the control cable with a known good cable once the 40-foot Interconnecting cable has been determined to be faulty or suspected as being faulty.

The procurement is for a total of 11 units and parts.  The quote is to be FOB Destination.
This procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.
