<DESC><p>This is a presolicitation/synopsis of proposed contract action as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 5.201, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.<br />The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, there is only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy the agency requirements, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<br /><br />All responsible sources may identify their interest and submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency except that foreign participation is NOT permitted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a solicitation. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the U.S. Air Force.<br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force established a requirement for the solicitation under product code 1410 Guided Missiles, and award of a new production contract for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Cryptography Upgrade, Increment II (ICU II) Program. This effort supports the Minuteman III (MM III) ICBM Weapon System by implementing Continuous Signal Lockout (CSLO), Remote Code Change (RCC) and Irreversible Transform (IT) capabilities in the A4 Drawer Programmer Group of the Launch Facility (LF). These key upgrades will add mission-essential improvements to MM III nuclear surety and promote overall robustness while decreasing significant vulnerabilities during code change operations.</p>
<p>This noncompetitive contract action taken under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) is justified based on the Government not having complete and adequate data of the A4 Drawer, e.g. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Gerber files which may be required in the performance of the contract. Additionally, award to any other vendor would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements and would result in substantial duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.<br /><br />The Government intends to award this requirement as a noncompetitive contract action to The Boeing Company - Defense, Space &amp; Security, 5301 Bolsa Avenue, Huntington Beach, CA 92347 United States (CAGE: 0B0D7) This will be accomplished via a sole source contract.<br /><br />It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about 29 March 2018 and contract award will occur on approximately 21 August 2018. The basic award is expected to deliver 75 Ea. A4 Drawers part number:&nbsp;10724-301,&nbsp;&nbsp;and have a delivery period from October 2020- May 202I. The first option is expected for an additional 240 Ea. drawers from May 2021-May 2022. The final option will deliver 191 Ea. drawers from June 2022-June 2023, which will equate to a total of 506 Ea. drawers ordered.</p>
<p>Delivery will be to 5851 F Ave, Building 489, Hill Air Force Base, Utah 84056-5734.<br />One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to Free Trade Agreements.<br />Respondents are requested to specify whether they are large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned SB, Hub zone SB, Veteran-owned SB, or Service-disabled veteran- owned SB, and whether U.S. or foreign-owned firm.<br />Be advised that periodic access to the websites listed above is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding the procurement.<br />Questions and comments should be emailed to Jessica.Jurkowski@us.af.mil<br />Point of Contact(s): <br />Jessica Jurkowski, Contract Specialist, Phone 801.775.4916, Email Jessica.Jurkowski@us.af.mil<br />Sean McDonough, Contracting Officer, Phone 801.775.6738, Email Sean.Mcdonough.1@us.af.mil</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 811219 with a small business size standard of $20,500,000 in average annual revenue. <br /><br />The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract to refurbish and upgrade two radiometers with:<br />ATS Services, Ltd<br />35 Auriga Drive, Unit 213<br />Ottawa ON K2E 8B7<br />1-613-221-9815<br />POC: Larry Malenfant
<p>The requirement is to refurbish two radiometers with model number LWP-U72+82-G4 from G4 to G5. This includes new noise injection system, data acquisition system, modification of the power supply, modification of the hot load sensors, adapt side wall to accept cold target, precision cold calibration target, new rotating mirror motor, and inspection of other components. Original equipment manufacturer is Radiometer Physics GmbH (RPG), Werner-von-Siemens-Str. 4, 53340 Meckenheim, Germany.</p>
<p>Market research to date has determined that no other source can meet the requirements, most notably ATS is the authorized US distributer and agent for RPG. A party other than ATS servicing, altering, or performing the requirement described in this notice would void existing warranties and agreements.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to richard.childres@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice.

<DESC><p>The government will provide In-Phase Quadrature (I/Q) data collection files that represent radar and ECM responses for RFCM test scenarios to be analyzed. Data will be provided via classified media. Every test scenario will either include (a) description/model of the expected ECM or (b) trusted collection that contains an ECM response that will be used to generate limits. These limits will then be used to compare test results for other data collections for this test scenario. The prime objective is for the contractor to highlight all of the areas where the ECM response went outside of the expected tolerances in order for the government to do further investigation or document problems with the SUT. Below is a list of tasks required:</p>
<p>The contractor shall import I/Q formatted binary files that contain radar and Electronic counter measures baseband I/Q sample data.</p>
<p>2.1.2. The contractor shall provide advanced electronic countermeasure (ECM) analysis for multiple false target (MFT) techniques.</p>
<p>2.1.3. The contractor shall separate and analyze false targets independently.</p>
<p>2.1.4. The contractor shall analyze up to 20 false targets in parallel.</p>
<p>2.1.5. The contractor shall perform required advanced analysis of each false target includes range, velocity, amplitude, amplitude modulation (modulation rate and duty cycle), pulse width, blanking, and percent jamming characteristics. The contractor shall ensure all frequency analyses have frequency accuracy better than 150 Hz.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor shall analyze all pulses with PWS of 100 ns or more.</p>
<p>2.1.7. The contractor shall perform analysis on pulsed and CW signals.</p>
<p>2.1.8. The contractor shall model expected ECM results for each false target. Government will provide expected ECM characteristics and allowable tolerances for each false target.</p>
<p>2.1.9. The contractor shall generate interactive graphs that plot actual results (range, velocity, etc.) versus allowable limits. Interactive graphs must have zoom and pan capabilities.</p>
<p>2.1.10. The contractor shall display data and limits for each false target on separate graph layers so that false targets can be turned off and on.</p>
<p>2.1.11. The contactor shall evaluate results versus limits and display all failing data points in red.</p>
<p>2.1.12. The contractor must be able to process I/Q data representing an instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) up to 125 MHz with collection times up to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide a final engineering report containing all ECM analysis, models, results, graphs and data produced by the tasks above. Additionally the contractor will provide all digital analysis products, models, and software developed under this contract in a Software Test Report</p>

<DESC>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
<p>This notice is issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 5.201to notify the public of a proposed contract action.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors operates one of the world's largest news media networks, bringing news, information, and relevant discussions to a weekly audience of over 278 million people worldwide, in over 100 countries in over 60 languages via radio, television, Internet, and social media. The BBG network is comprised of five major international broadcasters: the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio and Television Marti, Radio Free Asia, and the Middle East Broadcast Networks. Our networks carry out a shared mission vital to U.S. national interests: "to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy." Our agency is unique in the federal government in that we create, produce, and broadcast news around the world. We do so for people whose governments limit or block their people's access to a free press, or who simply lack sources of reliable news on events in their own countries, the United States, or around the world.</p>
<p>The agency is interested in conducting a study of its current leases and space needs to determine whether it is in its best interest to remain where it is headquartered, or to relocate its headquarters building to a new location, or various permutations of options that may include co-locating all of its operations or splitting them into different locations.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) proposes to issue a solicitation to procure the services of a full service commercial property consultant/lease broker to support the agency by performing the following activities:</p>
<p>-	Conducting a study and analysis of the agency's current lease(s);<br />-	Analyzing the agency's space and space allocation needs;<br />-	Developing an analysis of alternatives on how the agency can best meet its future space needs;<br />-	Developing an OMB Exhibit 300 business case for review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); and<br />-	Developing "Lease Scoring" documentation in accordance with OMB Circular A-11, Appendix B - Budgetary Treatment of Lease-Purchases and Leases of Capital Assets.</p>
<p>The planned procurement will include line items for the following optional services that the agency may award to the selected firm without further competition, or may procure from a different source through a separate procurement. Performance of these services will be based on a no-cost contract model, whereby the selected firm will receive its remuneration from lease commissions it earns from the property owner if the agency procures a lease:</p>
<p>-	Lease brokerage/acquisition services for approximately 500,000 square feet of office/studio space; and<br />-	Disposition services.</p>
<p>Due to the complexities and legal requirements of federal leases, the agency intends to limit competition to firms with recent and substantial proven experience providing similar real estate services to other federal government agencies. In support of this objective, the BBG intends to limit competition to contractors holding contracts with the General Services Administration (GSA) under its GSA Leasing Support Services (GLS) contract or under its previous GSA National Broker Contract. The agency has determined that no other types of services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1.)</p>
<p>The agency plans to publicize the solicitation on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about 30 days from the date of this notice. The solicitation will close approximately 30 days thereafter. Written proposals will be requested at that time. Contractors are advised to periodically check FBO.gov to obtain updated information regarding the subject matter procurement. It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the FBO.gov website for the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments. The official method for distribution of this solicitation is FBO.gov. The solicitation and its amendments, if any, will be available in electronic format only. No CDs or hard copies will be provided.</p>
<p>Although at this time the agency is considering publicizing the requirement on FBO, based on the results of market research currently underway, the agency may elect to pursue the procurement under the GSA's Professional Services Schedule (PSS).</p>
<p>A determination not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency; however, any response to this notice must demonstrate clearly and convincingly to the Government that competition would be advantageous to the Government in meeting its needs.</p>
<p>Interested parties desiring to submit a capability statement may submit one by e-mail to Amber Gray at agray@bbg.gov or Charles Hill at chill@bbg.bbg.gov not later than 12:00 PM (EDT), Friday, April 13, 2018. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 531210 (Offices of Real Estate Agents and Brokers); Small Business Size Standard is $15 million dollars and $7.5 million dollars. The Product Service Code (PSC) for this effort is R402.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this synopsis must be submitted by e-mail to agray@bbg.gov or chill@bbg.bbg.gov.</p>
<p>All prospective Contractors are required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) before award as required by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.1102. Information on registering may be obtained by accessing the SAM website at www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), through the Office of Chief Counsel (AGC), Administrative Services Division (AGC-10), has a requirement to replace its current case management system; Matter Tracking Information System (MTIS).  MTIS is no longer effective nor efficient; the system does not allow AGC to manage case data effectively and does not include a records management component.  The replacement system would centralize and streamline the work of our legal and administrative workforce; simplify overall office management; contain library functionality; and enhance efficiency in the delivery of legal services.  The replacement system will help boost productivity and promote the storage of files and documents digitally.  

This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Section T3.2.1.2. The purpose of this market survey is for the Government to gain an understanding of the marketplace to identify businesses capable of providing the subject requirement. Interested vendors are encouraged to respond to this market survey in accordance with the instructions attached and in accordance with the Draft Statement of Work.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a Hybrid Substrate and Package<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br /><br />The purpose of the project is to build a prototype infrared focal plane array (FPA). This is needed for the TIRCIS project<br /><br />In 2015, the same vendor designed the EUROIC FPA which was a more complex version of TIRCIS.<br /><br />&nbsp;TIRCIS requires a substrate and a package.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope</span><br /><br />The vendor (Quik-pak) is an integrated circuit packaging company. They will design a substrate, fabricate the substrate and assemble the TIRCIS thermopile array and the MCD2G ASIC on the substrate and package it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deliverables and Delivery Schedule</span><br /><br />Deliverables are 3 assembled hybrid packages and five bare substrates.<br /><br />Delivery schedule is approximately five months after PO award</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Place of Performance</span><br /><br />Vendor's facilities in California</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance<br /></span><br />Approximately five months from receipt of final circuit schematic and requirements.</p>
<p><br />NASA/NSSC intends to issue a sole source contract to Quik-pak 10987 Via Frontera, San Diego, CA 92127-1703 under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). Quik-pak are unique in that they do both chip assembly and hybrid design. It has been determined that Quik-pak design team are familiar with the requirements of thermopile based focal plane arrays. They produced a layout for a much more complex product in 2015 and they have the design database for the earlier design. This can be modified for TIRC1S. <br /><br />There is a risk with quality control which is particularly stringent for the custom thermopiles that we have in house. We only have three thermopiles and they must be assembled correctly first time. In addition, the ASICs have a very high pad count (208) so there is a lot of complexity involved in the assembly.</p>
<p>NASA/NSSC will be the procuring center for this effort. Performance will be at the Vendor's facilities in California.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire commercial items and services using the provisions, clauses and procedures prescribed in FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 334516. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 27, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html .</p>

<CONTACT>Jessica Adams, Contract Specialist, Email jessica.adams@nih.gov - Jeffrey Schmidt, Contacting Officer, Email jeffrey.schmidt@nih.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY:
<p>This is a notice of a proposed contract action issued in accordance with FAR 5.203(a). The Government intends to issue RFP No. N01TR-19-2005, titled "CRO Support for NCATS Animal Model Development and In Vivo Pharmacology Studies and Related Services," via FedBizOpps on or about March 30, 2018.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENT AND TYPE OF SERVICE</p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in the area of human therapeutics development.<br />The objective of this contract is to support the DPI drug development programs by providing services related to the development of animal models and the execution of in vivo pharmacology and related studies, including the use of relevant supporting services needed to accomplish requested tasks.<br />The DPI program requires confirmation and verification of the efficacy of development compounds in an acceptable animal model of the disease. To accomplish this endeavor, DPI has a need for novel, re-developed, optimized, or use of existing, validated animal models to conduct in vivo pharmacology studies for rare disorders and neglected diseases. These models are not able to be pre-determined as needs change depending on the disease; as such, access to both small (e.g., mice, rat) and large (e.g., dog, cat, monkey, pig) models are needed. In addition, therapies can cover a wide range of modalities, small molecules, and biologics (e.g. antibody, proteins, and cell and gene therapy).<br />While this contract will be primarily in support of the DPI drug development programs. The Government reserves the right to allow other drug development programs at NIH to solicit task order proposals. As such, this contract is not limited to rare or neglected disorders.<br />RELEASE OF SOLICITATION</p>
<p>The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposals on or about March 30, 2018. Proposals will be due 45 calendar days following release of the RFP.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract awards -with the eventual contract being administered and funded via Task Orders (TO). <br />The ultimate goal of DPI and this planned project is to bring new drugs to market. To this end, the Government has issued a Determination of Exceptional Circumstances (DEC) to deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses at 52.227-11 Patent Rights and 52.227-14 Rights in Data. The deviated language enables DPI contributors to retain control of their intellectual property and will be included in the RFP and incorporated in any resultant contract. Prospective Offerors are advised that agreement to the terms of these FAR clauses deviations will be a condition for contract award.</p>
<p>This is a new requirement; therefore, no incumbent information is provided. The Government will select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in accordance with the basis of award included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates awards will be made in the first quarter of FY2019.</p>
<p>ABOUT DPI AND NCATS</p>
<p>The Division of Preclinical Innovation (DPI) at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) conducts translational research in human therapeutics development and aims to move small molecule and biologic drug candidates forward in the drug development pipeline to predetermined milestones, at which point, DPI will hand off the drug candidate to external partner(s) to bring the novel therapy to patients.</p>
<p>In addition to developing new candidate drugs, DPI seeks to advance the entire field of drug discovery and development by encouraging scientific and technological innovations aimed at improving success rates in the crucial pre-clinical stage of drug development. DPI's model is to operate as a full range small molecule and biologics drug development organization, moving drug candidates through each phase of the pre-clinical drug development process until an IND is filed with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<p>DPI conducts drug development as collaborations through programs such as the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) and the Bridging Interventional Development Gaps (BrIDGs) programs. DPI drug development programs originate from academia, industry, non-profit foundations, or internally from NCATS and other NIH institutes, and its R&amp;D operational strategy is to combine the capabilities of DPI in-house staff and DPI partners, who may be the drug originators. Each drug program operates in a multi-disciplinary, multi-partnership matrix team environment, and a DPI program officer (PO) is responsible for the overall planning, execution, and reporting of the program.</p>
<p>Contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) provide DPI with manufacturing, pharmacology, toxicology, regulatory, and clinical operations services to assist with drug development. Planning and execution of each individual drug development program includes identification of scientific areas best suited for utilization of CROs and CMOs to conduct some or all parts of a given drug development program.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a one <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract for the MK 41 VLS. This PBL contract will be awarded to Lockheed Martin (LM) (Cage Code: 38597) located in Baltimore, MD in November 2018. Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will stock, warehouse, repair, modify and/or replace, store and provide for shipment of Ready-for-Issue (RFI) condition assets within the negotiated contractor response times.<br /><br />The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support. LM will be required to meet established response times through component repair replacement, reliability oversight and inventory, configuration and obsolescence management. <br /><br /><br /><br />The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed one (1) year. Justification for Sole Source Acquisition: the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />Absent interest/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with Lockheed Martin (LM) (Cage Code: 38597) the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the components to be covered under this PBL contract. LM is the only source with the engineering expertise and technical data necessary to perform essential PBL tasks such as repair, resolution of obsolescence issues, sustainment of reliability, and configuration management covered by the contemplated procurement. Further, only LM owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production, and process data required for reliability sustainment. In addition, only LM has access to the original design data/OEM intellectual property.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Michael Schmidt, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Michael.schmidt3@navy.mil<br />The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items, LM 98357, will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.<br /><br />If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will be considered for award under this solicitation.<br /><br />Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. <br /><br />Subcontracting Opportunities: All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin.</span></p>

<SUBJECT>16--Soliciting a Proposal for F/A-18 Depot Level Support under the Boeing Captains of Industry (BCOI) Contract.

<DESC>DLA Aviation at Philadelphia will solicit a proposal for the acquisition of performance based support for F/A-18 Depot Level Support #2 under the Boeing Captains of Industry (BCOI) contract, SPRPA1-14-D-200U.  Under the BCOI contract the contractor will provide following: logistics management, which includes wholesale supply support, depot-level consumable support, material management, engineering support and sustainment elements, packaging, storage, reliability improvements, and field engineering support. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) - Aviation seeks to continue providing fleet support under the current BCOI contract by adding the F/A-18 Depot Support requirement. The support is broken down into two areas: direct aviation platform material support and spare parts/material support used in the repair of aviation components and airframes at DoD repair depots.
  For material support, the contractor will be required to fill DoD and FMS customer requisitions for approximately 230 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) for the F/A-18. The NSNs under the BCOI contract are comprised of both consumable and depot level repair material. The attached list of items consists solely of consumable items which will be added to the existing BCOI contract, see Attachment A.  The contractor will be required to meet supply chain performance based metrics for material availability for approximately 230 NSNs for the F/A-18 through Depot support. 

This effort contemplated to be procured from Boeing, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, will be required to provide comprehensive support of the program.
  Due to the age of the weapon system, drawings are no longer up-to-date; tooling is no longer available or un-useable; materials may be obsolete and the vendor base has significantly diminished since the parts were last purchased.  DLA lacks sufficient technical data to compete the complete requirement effectively and Boeing, as the F/A-18 A-D OEM, possesses the technical capability and data to produce these items.   The integrated approach to supporting the F/A-18 High Flight Hour and Planned Maintenance Interval line enables DLA to meet Navy and Marine Corps planning timeframes and reduces the risk of impact to the warfighter.  The contract is planned as a Fixed Price action against the BCOI contract, which is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies.
  

Under the F/A-18 Depot Level Support, the contractor will be required to provide the following: tailored support based on needs, material support, supply chain engineering support, field service rep, maintenance planning, planning and support, and provide engineering liaison. 
The performance metrics will be based on the level of demand for the individual NSN. For the depot support, the contractor will be required to fill material requirements to facilitate repair in Government repair depots supporting Boeing aviation platforms. The contractor will be required to fill all material requirements emanating from individual component repair and airframe depot events bill of materials (RBOMs) at DoD repair depots for Boeing aviation platforms.
 In addition to filling the RBOM requirements, the contractor is expected to make recommendations for Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs). Additionally, the contractor will be required to aggregate all material requirements, i.e. production, repair, allowances, in order to leverage the best value for material support. This add-on to the BCOI contract is directly for the F/A-18 Depot Level Support.  The contractor will be paid based on the aggregate demands or other appropriate measurements of usage of the specific weapon systems. The items that will be included in this contract are currently procured under various contracts with the DLA.  The contract will also include necessary support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.
 The BCOI Contract is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for the Depot support.  The contractor will be required to deliver their supplies to Government wholesale and retail supply points both CONUS and OCONUS within specified time windows.  The BCOI contract has a performance period of five (5) year base period with one five (5) year option to extend the contract for a total performance period of ten years. 

Under the BCOI Contract, the Contractor will carry out logistics functions for the specified items while meeting daily Services demand requirements (i.e., filling various Services requisitions) within a specified response time to CONUS and OCONUS destinations.  DLA requires strategies that would include partnering with Government entities such as Organic Depots.

<p><br />REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Depot repair of the Receiver/Transmitter Sub-Assemblies applicable to the AN/APN-232 System, Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA).</p>
<p>Purpose/Description</p>
<p>The Government is conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet the requirement to provide the depot repair of the Receiver/Transmitter Sub-Assemblies applicable to the AN/APN-232 System, CARA. The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to accomplish, repair, test, packing, preservation and packaging, and return to the government in a completely serviceable/like new condition at the unit prices established at the time of a contract award, the items of Air Force equipment listed below. The contractor will be responsible for recurring and nonrecurring engineering services associated with becoming a qualified source. Contractor will be responsible for supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues and delivery of serviceable assets.</p>
<p>The specific assets to be repaired for this effort are found below:<br />Part Number NOUN NSN Estimated Repair<br />Requirement over <br />the next 12 months<br />8020000852-4 Radio Frequency Assy 5895-01-190-2940CW 252 each<br />8010000806-4 Signal Data Converter 5895-01-567-7326CW 47 each<br />8030005269-1 Switch Filter Assembly 5998-01-338-6519CW 15 each</p>
<p>This requirement is for repair services. Our repair strategy is a five year contract (basic plus four option years) and will continue through FY24.</p>
<p>Physical Description:<br />The Radio Frequency (RF) Assembly is a multi-function unit consisting of three subassemblies (transmitter, receiver and linearizer) providing the CARA system with the means for signal transmission of a Frequency Modulation/Continuous Wave waveform, reception and conversion of the RF signal to an IF signal and linearization of the (FM/CW) transmission. The transmit power is controlled to a level just sufficient to maintain track thereby providing the CARA system with Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) capability. The RF assembly also filters and amplifies the received signal, and using a sample of the transmitted signal as the local oscillator (LO), converts this signal to quadrate IF outputs. In addition, the RF Assembly compares a sample of the transmitted waveform with an internally generated comb of frequencies. This comparison results in the generation of quadrature video signals which are provided as outputs to the CARA processor which returns a corrected FM Sweep drive to provide the required amount of RF Sweep linerarity for the transmitted FM/CW waveform. Finally, the RF Assembly contains an externally selectable self-test signal which has been generated via an internal RF delay line.</p>
<p>The Signal Data Converter (SDC) is a component of the Combined Altitude Radar Altimeter (CARA) on the F-16 aircraft. The Converter is a solid state, microprocessor controlled signal converter which transforms the digital output of an RT- 1438/ AN-APN-232(V) Receiver-Transmitter (RT) into an altitude, and an altitude rate signal conforming to restricted F-16 1553/ 1553B protocols. In addition the Converter provides the following discrete altitude-related signals to be used by Altitude standby signal, Radar altimeter ready signal, Low altitude warning, Altimeter out-of-track and Altitude reliable signal.</p>
<p>The Switch and Filter Assembly is a potted assembly that consists of two subassemblies: The Electromagnetic Interference subassembly (A1) and the Power Switch and Regulator subassembly (A2). A1 suppresses voltage spikes and transients, while A2 reduces the filtered +28 vdc to regulated +10 vdc.</p>

<p>I.  Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1.	OPIC seeks to identify sources available for the acquisition of cloud-based federal budgeting software and associated software support. Companies that have provided federal government budgeting software and support are highly encouraged to respond to this RFI. Companies that have no history providing federal government budgeting software and support should not respond. OPIC is not limiting this procurement to only small business but is looking for the best value budgeting solution.</p>
<p>2.	OPIC is issuing this RFI for market research purposes only.</p>
<p>II. White Paper Content:  Interested industry respondents are requested to provide a White Paper that answers the following questions:</p>

Collect and utilize data from the general ledger,<br />ii.	Collect bottom-up budget requests from program offices, provide review / approval workflow, and accumulate budget data organization-wide<br />b.	Provide scenario planning / analytics, such as formulation of budget scenarios for budget planning purposes and hypothetical situation analysis,<br />c.	Interface / integrate with existing and future systems, for example,<br />i.	Budget execution system - Oracle E-Business Suite Federal Administrator<br />ii.	Automated reporting systems  - OMB MAX<br />d.	Ability to adjust and re-program budget plans at the department level <br />e.	Allow for future year planning, such as future year costs, out-year planning, and option years<br />f.	Provide accessibility / permissions controls for various user groups (i.e., budget office, finance team, human resources)<br />2.	Does the software platform meet federal government cloud requirements and other federal IT regulations?<br />3.	What is the approach and timeframe for training OPIC staff in the use of the software? <br />4.	OPIC has three budget analysts and one budget officer and handles a budget of $70,000,000 per year. What is the rough order of magnitude price for providing budgeting software that meets the high requirements above, regular upgrades, and related support for an office having these demands on its system? <br />5.	What is the respondent's history of providing budgeting software and support, and is the respondent currently able to perform this work either free of Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) or after submitting an acceptable OCI mitigation plan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers (even if in the negative) to all questions above are required. Negative replies to one or more of the above questions will not automatically rule a respondent as incapable but instead will be considered as part of a holistic review of the current marketplace for budgeting software and support. OPIC will consider a response that does not include an answer to one or more of the above questions as non-responsive. OPIC reserves the sole discretion to either follow up with a non-responsive submitter to request correction or clarification or to completely disregard the RFI submission as non-responsive.</p>
<p>III.

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia is interested in developing sources for a five year Performance Based Logistics (PBL) requirements contract with one two-year option period in support of the AV-8B aircraft. Efforts under this contract will include stocking, warehousing, repair, modification and/or replacement, storage, and providing of Ready-for-Issue condition assets for those components included within this document. The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor will assume responsibility for the management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support. The PBL contractor will be required to meet established supply response times through WRA/LRU repair and replacement, reliability oversight, as well as inventory, configuration, and obsolescence management.
  The contractor will be required to partner with organic depots such as FRC-E (Cherry Point) and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Service Agreements.
As indicated in this Sources Sought Notice, in absence of interest by/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract for this effort with the only approved source, Ontic UK, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Specifically, the Government intends to award a Performance Based Logistics contract for the attached NIINs and Part Numbers in support of the AV-8B aircraft. It should be noted by potential interested sources that the Government does not have the rights to, and thus cannot provide access to, technical data/drawings that may be required for manufacture or repair of these components.
 It should also be noted that because the items on this procurement include Critical Safety Items (CSI) and Critical Application Items (CAI), interested sources must obtain Navy source approval in order to be eligible for award. While interested sources are invited to submit a source approval request, due to the Fleetâs need for the subject effort, the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that the contemplated award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Olga Maksimchuk, by email at olga.maksimchuk@navy.mil or phone (215) 697-3111.

<DESC><strong>1.0 Description</strong>
<p>1.1 The Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) in Frankfurt, Germany in support of the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking information on how a contractor could support an elevator maintenance program in seventeen (17) different locations in Africa as follows:</p>
<p>Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire <br />Abuja, Nigeria<br />Accra, Ghana<br />Bamako, Mali<br />Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo<br />Conakry, Guinea <br />Cotonou, Benin <br />Dakar, Senegal <br />Freetown, Sierra Leone<br />Lagos, Nigeria <br />Libreville, Gabon <br />Lome, Togo <br />Monrovia, Liberia<br />N'Djamena, Chad <br />Niamey, Niger <br />Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso <br />Yaounde, Cameroon <br /><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, RPSO is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>2.0 Background</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Overseas Building Operations (OBO) is responsible for the maintenance and repair of Government owned and leased facilities of U.S. Department of State (DOS) diplomatic missions worldwide. OBO requires services of a Contractor to maintain building elevators in safe, reliable and efficient operating condition in West Africa.&nbsp; All elevators to be maintained are OTIS Electric Traction elevators.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 Responses</strong></p>
<p>3.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>3.2 White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2000 or PDF compatible format are due no later than 16 April 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Summer Time (EST). Responses shall be limited to fifteen (15) pages and submitted via e-mail only to CollinsSE@state.gov. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED.

"Small business concern" means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, with 1,000 or fewer employees. Respondees are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only. Additional standards and conditions apply. Please refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 19 for additional detailed information on Small Business Size Standards.</p>

The Memorial Arch, atop which the figure was attached, is a contributing object to this National Register property. The cemetery is located at:

Camp Chase Confederate Cemetery
2900 Sullivan Avenue
Columbus, OH 43204 

The 17-foot sandstone arch was erected in 1902. An upright, zinc Confederate soldier figure manufactured by the Monumental Bronze Co., Bridgeport, CT, stood atop the center of the arch. 

The arch and figure underwent conservation treatment in 2010. At that time the zinc figure was removed for repair. Missing components of the statue, including socket of the bayonet, trigger, hammer, ramrod, end of the barrel, end of the bayonet s scabbard, and one strap of the canteen, were refashioned and soldered to statue; metal plates were affixed to the underside of the statue to distribute weight evenly across the base; cracks in the brim of the hat, the top of each shoulder, and on the bottom of the bedroll were filled with solder; cracks in the left knee, ears, tail end of the bedroll, and between bedroll and pant leg were filled with grey color-matched epoxy; and the statue was cleaned to remove residues from previous coatings and new components painted to match. It was then reinstalled with new bronze anchor bolts.
In August 2017, the statue was vandalized; the figure was pulled down from atop the arch and its head cut off. The head was not recovered. At this time the body, hat, and other pieces are securely stored off-site at Dayton National Cemetery, Dayton, OH.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons, is seeking proposals in regards to a Prototype Opportunity Notice (PON) for Next Generation Squad Automatic Rifle (NGSAR). The NGSAR is the first variant of the Next Generation Squad Weapons. The NGSAR will address operational needs identified in various capability based assessments and numerous after action reports. The NGSAR is the planned replacement for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) in Brigade Combat Teams (BCT). It will combine the firepower and range of a machine gun with the precision and ergonomics of a rifle, yielding capability improvements in accuracy, range, and lethality. The weapon will be lightweight and fire lightweight ammunition, improving Soldier mobility, survivability, and firing accuracy. Soldiers will employ the NGSAR against close and extended range targets in all terrains and conditions. The NGSAR support concept will be consistent and comparable to the M249 SAW involving the Army two-level field and sustainment maintenance system.<br /><br />The purpose of this PON for NGSAR is to award up to five Prototype OTAs under Section 815 OTA authority, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2371b, with the goal of developing a system demonstrator representative of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 6.<br /><br />A system Demonstrator refers to a functional prototype weapon, 2,000 rounds ammunition(s), fire control (day and night), bipod, suppressor, enablers (optional), spare part(s) to support firing 2,000 rounds, special tools, and operator manuals capable of firing and demonstrating the proposed capabilities to meet the lethality requirements. Mann Barrels do not constitute functional prototype weapons.<br /><br />See attached PON for NGSAR.

<DESC>The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Western Regional Office, Phoenix, AZ will issue a sole source award under a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition, FAR 6.302-1 âOnly One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirementsâ to Port Graham Technologies, LLC for temporary six (6) months continued Satellite Internet Services (beginning 03-25-2018 through 08-31-2018) for the fixed price of $7,767.00 ($1,294.50 monthly service fee) for the BIA Colorado River Branch of Electrical Services, Parker, AZ.  Current services are being provided under Purchase Order A17PX00640 which will expire on 03-24-2018  (issued from RFQ Solicitation No. A17PS00403, Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise (ISBEE) set-aside, which did not include Option Year clauses).  The $1.294.50 monthly service fee is determined to be a âfair and reasonableâ price as it is $2.59 less than Port Graham Technologiesâ monthly service fee price ($1,297.09) amount for Option Year One in response to the initial ISBEE set-aside RFQ A17PS00403.


The temporary award will provide time for the BIA to compete the requirement under a new Request for Quote (RFQ) ISBEE set-aside solicitation; it is expected that the new RFQ solicitation document will be issued no later than May 31, 2018.


This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitation is available for this requirement.  If a firm believes that BIA should not pursue this procurement, it should submit a capability statement and pricing information for the requirement by 9:00 a.m. MST on March 20, 2018 via email to paul.robinson@bia.gov.

Justification and Approval
For 
Brand Name Requirement
(redacted)

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 06, Hampton VA Medical Center, 100 Emancipation Drive, Hampton, VA 23667 Purchase Request No. xx.

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount: This is a brand name requirement is for heated and unheated air curtains from Berner International Corp and LED fixtures from Cree Inc., for the Richmond VAMC. Estimated amount $xx.

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used: The Richmond VAMC is in need of heated and unheated air curtains from Berner International Corp and LED fixtures from Cree Inc. The air curtains are needed for the facility s south mall entrance and front main entrance and the LED fixtures are required for the yellow clinic outside walkway lighting at the facility. The facility currently has a total of 12 fitted air curtains in the south mall entrance, front entrance, CLC entrance, SCI entrance and Multipurpose Room entrances. The 12 unheated and heated curtains will be used as direct replacements of unserviceable, broken out of warranty air curtains. New replacement curtains are to match the existing 12 units. The LED fixtures will be mounted along the yellow clinic outside walkway. Currently there is a total of 12 fixtures and all of those are malfunctioning and not providing the proper lighting necessary to ensure patient safety. Acquiring an entirely new or other types of models and/or fixtures for this requirement would not result in any financial or other benefit to the Government. The requested air curtains and LED fixtures match the existing equipment and would allow direct replacement as well as conformity to the existing power requirements and measurements. It is also important to keep costs down with regards to existing parts and service capabilities.

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  It was determined that BERNER and CREE are the only vendors who can match existing equipment and conform to the proper power requirements and measurements. It is also important to keep uniformity throughout the facility and keep costs down associated with parts and service.

Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Note: COs are required to make a determination of price reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3.  See the S19 Open Market (FAR13) Award Documentation Form with Abstract  to document price reasonableness.

DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">is offering the opportunity to license a new technology for the deposition of boron and silicon carbide thin films via a charged particle process.</span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">This invention describes the deposition of boron and silicon carbide films using a novel fabrication method. </span>Prior to this invention, deposition of boron containing materials via charged particle induced dissociation of boron precursor molecules had not been demonstrated. In industry, the main process is chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which relies on thermal dissociation of the precursor molecule to produce film growth. CVD has been used be produce a vast variety of boron containing materials and can be used to direct-write material using a laser beam. Techniques that rely on thermal heating for precursor dissociation such as CVD also involve heating of the substrate to processing temperature. Heating can induce thermally induced effects in the fabricated film and substrate, introducing material degradation and material distortion. This problem is also overcome in this described technology, which is critical in many fabrication environments.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">The LLNL charged particle deposition technology enables fabrication of material via the charged particle induced dissociation of precursor molecules. For the case electron beam induced fabrication of boron carbide, gaseous boron precursor is delivered to a substrate in a vacuum chamber. Surface adsorbed molecules are dissociated by a beam of electrons. Non-volatile fragments remain on the substrate leading to formation of a boron containing deposit.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto">The vacuum chamber and beam of charged particles are provided by a scanning electron/ion microscope or a large area flood irradiation system. The scanning electron microscope can provide a focused nanoscale beam of electrons or ions which is used to control the deposit feature size down to tens of nanometers. The beam can be scanned over the substrate to pattern features. A motorized stage can be used for patterning larger features across the substrate. The use of a large area flood irradiation system allows deposition of material with feature sizes on the order of hundreds of microns to a few millimeters under current designs and larger with further optimization.</p>

<DESC>N00164-18-S-NB60 - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/SOURCES SOUGHT - FLUKE WARRANTY- PSC 6625 - NAICS 334515
<p>Issue Date: 13 MAR 2018 - Closing Date: 03 APR 2018 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for Fluke Warranties. Procurement of one-year incremental warranties (repair/calibration) for previously purchased equipment from Fluke Corporation, as well as additional spare equipment which are expected to be purchased from Fluke. Per the market research of other Calibration equipment manufacturers, there were no equipment companies that sold equipment in the United States that would meet the calibration specifications of the Fluke Calibration equipment required to maintain the Teradyne test station instrumentation. Also, the other equipment found did not have any Navy approved calibration procedures in place. These warranties will be in support of maintaining the In-Station Calibration (ISC) effort in support of Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) Spectrum 9100 Flight Configuration Test Stations. This test station is used to test circuit and card assemblies (CCAs) in the Trident D5 Missile. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the current certified source, Fluke Corporation, 6920 Seaway Blvd, Everett, WA, 98203, (CAGE 4U744). This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition to Fluke Corporation is to avoid additional funding requirement of $3,202,480 and additional development time scheduled at 2 years to get Navy approval.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above. Companies with the capabilities to provide the warranties that meet the Government's requirement and certification may respond. Responses shall address how the Government can offset the estimated $3,202,480 in cost duplication and the 2 year schedule delay that are anticipated to result if a new source is utilized.</p>
<p>The following items and warranties are anticipated to be included in the procurement.</p>
<p>Part Number Nomenclature U/I MIN MAX<br />1620A-S Thermo Hygrometer EA 0 20<br />2626S Sensor (Probe) EA 0 20<br />5730A/03 115 5730A/03 115, METER CALIBRATOR 115V + WIDEBAND OPTION EA 0 20<br />5730A/03 115 (GP) Gold Plan - calibration/repair one year service per year 13 85<br />Y5738 RACK EAR KIT for Fluke 5730A/03 EA 0 20<br />3800663 57XX/Case, Transit Case EA 0 20<br />5790B/03 AC Measurement Standard EA 0 20<br />5790B:03 (GP) Gold Plan - calibration/repair one year service per year 1 5<br />732B/C DC Voltage Standard EA 0 10<br />742A-10K 10 Ohm Resistance Standard EA 0 10<br />742A-1 1 Ohm Resistance Standard EA 0 10<br />9500B/600 Oscilloscope Calibrator EA 0 20<br />9500B/600 (GP) Gold Plan - calibration/repair one year service per year 13 85<br />9500-90 FLK Rack Mounting Kit for Fluke 9500B/600 EA 0 20<br />1576502 9500/Case, Ruggedized Transit Case EA 0 20<br />9530 Fluke Active Head for scope calibrator EA 0 100<br />9530 (GP) Gold Plan - calibration/repair one year service per year 60 400<br />2100447 2100447, Case, Carrying, 9500 Head Transit Case EA 0 20</p>
<p>Responses shall include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, a budgetary estimate, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the significant Government investment in the existing warranties.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-18-S-NB60</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts. This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement. The POC for this effort is Mr. Lance Buechler, lance.buechler@navy.mil or 812-854-2973. The mailing address is:</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-</p>
<p>(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;</p>
<p>(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at .]</p>

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.</p>
<p>(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-</p>

<p>(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));</p>
<p>(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and</p>
<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>
<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-</p>
<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification<br />SOLICITATION: F5A6CE8039AW03 Page 5<br />12 March 2018<br />will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />FAR 52.252.1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference.

<p>(v) List of contract line item number(s), items, quantities and units of measure:</p>
<p>Line Item 1: Graduated livestock / wire panels - 6 gauge, 5 X 16	Quantity: 950 each<br /> Line Item 2: Delivery</p>
<p>**All cost to include but not limited to: overhead, general and administrative, profit, insurance, and shipping.</p>
<p>(vi)  Description of requirements for the items to be acquired.</p>
<p>The Missouri Feral Swine Program requires a specific livestock/wire panel for trapping feral swine in the field. These panels will be deployed statewide, but generally south of Interstate 44.  These panels must be constructed of galvanized metal and have an expected life period of performance no less than 10 years.  The panels must also be what is commonly referred to in the industry as "graduated".  That means that the panels must have 2"x 6" openings at the bottom, gradually increasing to 6" x 6"openings at the top. The reason for this requirement is to keep small piglets from escaping at the bottom, while reducing the weight of the panel and making it possible for one feral swine trapper to lift the panel by themselves.  The panels cannot be constructed of anything less (smaller) than 6 gauge metal, galvanized and welded at all cross members.  This requirement is to guarantee that the feral swine that are captured do not escape. The panels must be 5 feet tall.  This requirement also guarantee that the feral swine cannot climb out, or jump out once captured.  The panels must be 16 feet in total length.  This requirement is there because our corral traps are designed for diameters based on 16 foot in length panels, and the trailers we use to transport panels to the field are only capable of handling 16 foot long panels.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-96 (06 November 2017). The solicitation number for this requirement is PANAPG18P0000134009. This requirement has been deemed as a total small business set aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334513 and Business Size Standard is 750. The Government contemplates the award of a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract and will be evaluated based on the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA) offer.
<p>Description of Requirement: (SEE ATTACHED PWS)</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to acquire a Corrosion Chamber to provide Cyclic Corrosion Testing (CCT) for The U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. The provision at FAR 52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The contact will be awarded to the LPTA offeror. The technical evaluation will be a determination based on information furnished by the vendor in the submitted proposal. The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the offer. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussion.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS:</p>
<p>1. Technical: <br />The Technical volume of the proposal will be evaluated against the requirements describe in the PWS contained in this solicitation. The Technical Volume will be determined to be "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable", using the following ratings:</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Acceptable--Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable--Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>2. Price: <br />The Government will evaluate the price proposal for award purposes by using price analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1(b) based on competition and other factors. Accordingly, the analytical techniques and procedures described in FAR 15.404-1 may be used singly or in combination with others, as determined by the Contracting Officer, to ensure the costs are fair and reasonable. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental issue of the Offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal as inadequate.</p>
<p>EVALUATION &amp; BASIS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>Basis for Award:<br />The Government intends to award Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the LPTA proposal in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. To receive consideration for award, a rating of "Acceptable" must be achieved in the Technical factor.<br /><br />Rejection of Offers: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(g), the Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />a. Offers that provide only a statement indicating its capability to comply with the RFP terms without support and elaboration as specified in volume instructions stated in this combined synopsis/solicitation; or<br />b. Offers that reflect an inherent lack of technical competence or a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks required to perform the requirements. This may include submission of a proposal which is abnormally high or low in Price (unbalanced pricing) or unattainable in terms of technical or schedule commitments: or<br />c. Offers that do not meet all the stated material requirements of this combined synopsis/solicitation; or <br />d. Offers that propose exceptions to the attachments, exhibits, enclosures, or other combined synopsis/solicitation terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Evaluation and Source Selection Process <br />Selection: <br />Selection of the successful Offeror shall be made following an assessment of each proposal, based on the response to the requirements of this solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated as specified in Proposal Evaluation Section below.</p>
<p>Evaluation: <br />The evaluation of proposals submitted in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation shall be conducted in accordance with a LPTA competition.</p>
<p>Award without Discussions: <br />In accordance with FAR 52.212-1 (g), The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal shall contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
<p>Determination of Responsibility: In accordance with FAR 9.103, contracts will be placed only with Contractors that the Contracting Officer determines to be responsible. Prospective offerors, in order to qualify as sources for this acquisition must be able to demonstrate that they meet standards of responsibility set forth in FAR 9.104. No award can be made to an Offeror who has been determined non-responsible by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION<br />Evaluation Factors: The Technical volume of the proposal will be evaluated against the requirements described in the PWS contained in this solicitation. The Technical Volume will be determined to be "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable", using the following ratings:</p>
<p>Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings</p>
<p>Rating Description</p>
<p>Acceptable - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Technical Proposal:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1: Technical Factor: The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical proposal based on the technical factors stated in the PWS.</p>
<p>FACTOR 2: Price Factor<br />The Government will evaluate the price proposal for award purposes by using price analysis techniques described in FAR 15.404-1(b) based on competition and other factors. Accordingly, the analytical techniques and procedures described in FAR 15.404-1 may be used singly or in combination with others, as determined by the Contracting Officer, to ensure the costs are fair and reasonable. Any significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental issue of the Offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal as inadequate.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Addenda:</p>
<p>1.0 Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government's selection for an awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The purchase order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable.</p>
<p>2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach</p>
<p>All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the purchase order.</p>
<p>The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award based on initial proposals. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the purchase order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements: <br />a. Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>i. The contractor shall meet the following military standards and/or industry standard for the listed materials:<br />a. ARMOR, ALUMINUM, 5083, SPEC MIL-DTL-46027.

<p>Proposals will be evaluated to determine an offeror's Understanding of the Requirements and Feasibility of Approach.</p>

<p>(2) Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the SOW requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION <br />ACCEPTABLE Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. <br />UNACCEPTABLE Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price</p>
<p>1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be scored.</p>
<p>2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award. Unit pricing shall be listed with extended costs for each item.</p>
<p>3. Adequate competition is anticipated for this purchase order. However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c). Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received and the quote is $700,000 or more, the Contracting Officer shall obtain Certified Cost or Pricing Data.

<SOLNBR>PSC-18-016-INL
<RESPDATE>032718
<CONTACT>Dominique A. Chittum, Phone 2027369146, Email ChittumDA@state.gov
<DESC>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:<br />This position is located in the Office of Resource Management, Bureau of International Narcotics, and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL/RM).  The Bureau has overall responsibility for the development, supervision, and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and for international criminal justice issues for the Department of State.  The Foreign Service Assignments Officer (FSAO) will perform duties related to both domestic and foreign assignments, and will supplement existing staff during times of heavy workload, when staff shortages occur, or when expertise is required for specific projects.
<p>Relationship: <br />The FSAO receives administrative direction from the Administrative Officer, but acts with a high degree of independence in planning, scheduling, and completing work, within the framework of delegated authority.  Many assignments are self-initiated based on the FSAO's assessment of post requirements and the means to meet them.  As the primary liaison with post personnel, regional bureau staff, and office of Career Development and Assignments (HR/CDA) in the Bureau of Human Resources (HR), the FSAO has broad latitude in coordinating work efforts, and plays a key role in ensuring that posts operate effectively and in compliance with relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The FSAO uses a high degree of expertise and independent judgment in developing, consulting, coordinating, and executing programs to achieve compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and organizational goals and objectives, and resolves all but the most complex and sensitive issues.  Recommendations and decisions are assumed to be technically accurate, and work is reviewed in terms of the overall effectiveness of the efforts by management within INL/RM as well as by program office staff, post officials, and others who rely on the FSAO's advice and support.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities: <br />&bull;	Manages the Foreign Service Assignments process, providing expert advice and guidance to senior Bureau managers on all aspects of Foreign Service position management, recruitment, assignment, and evaluation.  <br />&bull;	Counsels Foreign Service staff on all assignment related questions and provides support and guidance to those individuals who have been offered positions within the Bureau.  <br />&bull;	Coordinates all FS issues with the appropriate offices within the Bureau of Human Resources, e.g., HR/CDA and HR/PE, resolving issues pertaining to FS assignments and performance, and recommends ways to improve or streamline the process.  <br />&bull;	Oversees suggestion and award, quality, and or productivity programs related to these activities.  Analyzes and evaluates, on a quantitative or qualitative basis, the effectiveness of programs or operations in meeting established goals and objectives.  <br />&bull;	Liaises with colleagues and professional contacts in other bureaus whose work and role are relevant to supporting INL, including but not limited to Diplomatic Security, the Office of Medical Services, HR/CDA, the Family Liaison Office, the Office of Foreign Missions, Office of Allowances, and others as required.  <br />&bull;	Analyzes administrative processes and/or agency programs for the Executive Director, with particular emphasis on management and implementation of an effective program in meeting Foreign Service human resources goals and objectives for the Bureau and its worldwide operations.  <br />&bull;	Identifies problem areas and opportunities for improvement and provides fully staffed recommendations to management, including the Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretaries.  This encompasses issues such as streamlining processes, assessing the feasibility of automated systems for meeting the Bureau's HR responsibilities, standardizing operations, or collaborating with other organizations on mutual responsibilities, improved management practices or the impact of new or proposed legislation or regulations on HR programs.  <br />&bull;	Communicates with colleagues, agency management, and other contacts outside the agency to gather and analyze information about these agency processes and programs. <br />Personal Contacts:<br />&bull;	Contacts include subject matter experts throughout the Department, as well as officials from traditional foreign affairs and other USG agencies, e.g. USAID and the Departments of Defense and Justice.  Contacts occur in a variety of structured and unstructured settings, and require highly developed communication, negotiation, and conflict resolution and leadership skills to attain desired results.</p>
<p>Purpose of Contacts<br />&bull;	Contacts are to influence, motivate, or persuade people or groups to accept opinions or to take actions related to the goals and objective of INL programs, and/or involve the commitment or distribution of major resources.  The FSAO may encounter opposition or resistance due to significant organizational conflicts, competing objectives, major resource limitations, or reductions.  As the INL representative in these settings, the FSAO must use tact and professionalism in persuading stakeholders of the merits of INL positions in order to achieve consensus and buy-in for INL objectives.</p>
<p>Physical Demands<br />&bull;	The work generally does not impose unusual physical demands.<br />&bull;	Periodic travel of varying duration may be required.</p>
<p>Work Environment<br />&bull;	The majority of the work is performed in a standard office setting.<br />Guidelines <br />&bull;	Guidelines consist of basic USG, Department of State, and Bureau-level policies and regulations covering various administrative and management functions and programs, as well as country and local laws.  These guidelines provide the basic information but often lack specificity and definitive answers or solutions, and thus are insufficient in dealing with unique or unusual situations.  Further, due to changing political climates and regional responsibilities, the FSAO must reevaluate their applicability in light of changing situations, and determine when to deviate from standard approaches in developing appropriate strategies and processes to meet INL requirements.  The FSAO uses a high degree of judgment, discretion, and ingenuity in interpreting and applying the intent of these guidelines, and in revising current policy and regulatory guidance for use by others.</p>
<p>Complexity <br />&bull;	The work involves providing expert analytical and advisory support for the planning, development and execution of INL policies and programs domestically, supporting INL missions at posts, and resolving a broad range of administrative and management issues using different and unrelated approaches and techniques in an environment of time-sensitive pressures and deadlines.</p>
<p>&bull;	The FSAO develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation of INL assignments at posts, as well as delivery of critical administrative services and guidance.  The work necessitates handling multiple actions, problems, and relationships concurrently.  Decisions on how to proceed are often complicated by conflicting goals and objectives of post management, host nation laws and requirements, and world events.  Decisions and actions must also take into account the precedents that are being set, or at least the perception that precedents are being set, and the long-term implications of short-term solutions.</p>
<p>&bull;	The FSAO must deliver service and resolve problems in this environment, and ensure that all stakeholders are satisfied with the results of his/her decisions and recommendations.</p>
<p>Scope and Effect <br />&bull;	The purposes of the work are to collaborate with management in the Department in providing prompt and effective administrative support of the assignment of FS personnel domestically and at INL positions at posts; support INL missions at posts in engaging their administrative and personnel resources as effectively as possible; liaise with relevant Bureaus and USG agencies to ensure that INL's best interests are protected; and ensure that administrative and substantive policies are mutually compatible.</p>
<p>&bull;	The FSAO's efforts play a critical role in ensuring that posts' administrative, operational, and managerial requirements are met to ensure their effective operations and ability to carry out their public diplomacy missions.</p>
<p>Minimum Qualifications: <br />1.	U.S. citizenship, with the ability to obtain and maintain a Department of State Secret security clearance.<br />2.

<p>RELATIONSHIPS<br />The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) carries out duties on behalf of the Contracting Officer (CO), but reports to the INL Senior Management Officer at Post. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) is delegated the authority to act for the Contracting Officer in matters concerning technical clarification, inspection and, after concurrence by the Contracting Officer, acceptance of Contractor performance under the contract, including preparation of receiving reports, and the authorization of progress payments when appropriate. The COR will coordinate all work with the Contractor and review Contractor's performance at significant stages of its development.</p>
<p>In no instance, however, shall the COR be authorized to alter or modify the specifications or the contract terms and the conditions or waive the government's requirement, price, delivery, or other terms and conditions. Such changes must be authorized, in writing, to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>COMPLEXITY<br />The programs implemented by INL are generally highly complex multi-year development and capacity-building programs. The programs often require the ability to resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.<br />Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently-changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND EFFECTIVENESS<br />The PSC performs broad and extensive assignments related to a complex administrative/financial program spanning the full-range of citizen safety, law enforcement, rule of law, and counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan, which is of significant interest to the public and to Congress.</p>
<p>MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS <br />1. U.S. citizen, obtain/maintain Department of State Secret security, Medical and Ethics clearance.<br />2. Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in one of the following areas: law enforcement, criminal justice, project management, public administration, architecture, construction science, construction management, or engineering (preferably structural or civil engineering) and six (6) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.<br />OR<br />A minimum of ten (10) years' professional work experience, of which five years should be directly related to performing functions in program management and/or contractor oversight.</p>

Demonstrated ability to engage constructively with senior government and industry officials.<br />8. Demonstrated professional experience working in an overseas environment including experience working in a conflict/post-conflict environment.</p>
<p>NOTE: FAC-COR Level II certification is a minimum requirement throughout the life of the contract. The ability to obtain/maintain a Federal Acquisition Certification-Contracting Officer's Representative (FAC-COR) Level III Certification is preferred.</p>
<p>PHYSICAL DEMANDS IN AFGHANISTAN<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites may be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft may also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED EQUIPMENT<br />The PSC shall be able to use an office space furnished with a computer, office telephone, and other supplies needed for job requirements. This property will be owned and maintained by the Department of State DoS.</p>

INL will not pay for any expenses associated with the interviews. In addition, applications (written materials and interviews) will be evaluated based on content as well as on the applicant's writing, presentation, and communication skills. In the event that a candidate has fully demonstrated his/her qualifications and there are no other competitive applicants, INL reserves the right to forego the interview process.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br />The Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) intends to award a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), due to only one source being available to meet the Government's needs, to APDM, Inc. located at 2828 SW Corbett Ave., Ste 130, Portland, OR 97201-4811. Requirement is for purchase of one (1) V2 Full Body Moveo Explorer Kinematics System with 15 Opal Movement Sensors; three (3) V2 Opal Wearable Sensor; six (6) V2 Strap - Wrist and Ankle; two (2)V2 Strap - Lumbar, and two (2) V2 Strap - Sternum. The Extremity Trauma and Amputation Center of Excellence (EACE) at the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) has a congressionally-mandated mission to serve as the joint DoD-VA lead element focused on the mitigation, treatment and rehabilitation of Service Members and Veterans with traumatic extremity injuries and amputations. The established EACE Movement Retraining Clinic (MRC) requires a research-grade, non-optical, integrated hardware and software system to measure body segment kinematics based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology. The system must provide estimates of three-dimensional orientation in both real time and post-processed analysis as both individualized sensors and as a synchronized whole-body network. The IMU sensor hardware must have completely wireless interconnection, a range of at least 30 meters, at least 8 hours of full operation battery life, a latency of &lt;30ms in real time streaming mode, and sample up to 200Hz for orientation estimates. Modeled joint kinematics must include the ankle, knee, hip, lumbar, trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Automated processing time after recording should not exceed 3 minutes. System must provide validated, normative able-bodied data for all measured biomechanical metrics for comparison against measured data. Validation reports must also be present in the scientific peer-reviewed literature for the hardware and measured gait metrics.
<p>APDM, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can provide these salient characteristics mentioned above. The APDM Moveo solution is the only system that meets the requirement of allowing low-power continuous data logging for greater than 28 days, independent of a receiver and base computer, while also having completely wireless interconnection between all componentry. Additionally, the APDM Mobility Lab and Moveo proprietary software are the only known solution that facilitates processing the IMU raw data directly to graphs in a clinical report, format, for use in specific physical therapy outcome assessment, to include the Timed Up and Go, five-Timed Sit-to-Stand, Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance. Metrics calculated must include at minimum: gate speed, gait cycle duration, foot strike angle, toe out angle, trunk and lumbar ranges of motion, and discrete measures of postural sway. The APDM solution is also the only system that includes normative able-bodied data for all tests.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for the requirement. Sources interested in responding to this notice are required to submit a capability statement that includes management and technical data and cost information, in sufficient detail and with convincing evidence that clearly demonstrates the capability to perform the required work.

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br /><br />(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.<br />Solicitation:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Item No. Supplies/Service Quantity Unit Unit price Amount<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />0001............................

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations<br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, âdoing business asâ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the âSuspension of paymentâ paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations.

Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command
