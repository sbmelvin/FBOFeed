The firm must possess a good record of past performance on contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.    Secondary Selection Criteria: 	a. SB and SDB Participation. The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) measured as a percentage of the total  anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration 	b.

The imaging system must be based around a simple inverted microscope with dry objectives, both of which are optimized for UV excitation.  The system (microscope, illumination system and computer) must have a small footprint due to limited space.  Of major importance, because the system must be used by individuals with vastly differing levels of expertise, the software architecture should specifically direct the user in the appropriate method of performing a calcium experiment using the ratiometric calcium-dye technique.  Hardware Requirements:  1)  Inverted research microscope with infinity-corrected optics: 2) UV excitation wavelength(s) at 340 and 380 nm, i.e. suitable for excitation ratio imaging with Fura-2: 3) Additional filter set for viewing the following fluorochromes: YFP, GFP:  4) Microscope objectives: high NA 10x dry, high NA 20x dry:  5) Microscope stage that accommodates custom sample chambers in addition to standard 35mm petri dishes and 1"x3" slides:  6)  Adjustable averaging or integration of detector/camera:  7) Continuous, and simultaneous adjustment of excitation intensity attenuation:  8) The ability to independently adjust the image intensity at each of the excitation wavelengths during data capture:  9) Host computer with flat panel display with at least 1280x1024 resolution and no less than 512 MB RAM.  Software Requirements:  1) Software guides the user through the steps necessary for performing a correctly calibrated calcium imaging experiment:  2) Program configuration parameters can be saved and recalled under different configuration names:  3)  Program/experiment parameters can be saved and recalled with an experiment's data:  4)  Minimum acquisition time interval is no more than 1 sec for Fura-2 imaging of live cells:  5) Software saves images in TIFF format:  6) ROI (Region of Interest) kinetics analysis is available during acquisition as well as during post-acquisition analysis:  7)  User can pause and resume acquisition:  8)  User is limited to no less than 20 ROIs for concurrent measurement and graphing:  9)  User has choice for ROI shape-- rectangular, elliptical, or user-defined:  10) ROIs can be different colors:  11)  Image and graph are in separate windows, and can be displayed at the same time:  12) User chooses whether or not to measure ROIs:  13)  User chooses whether or not to display graph(s):  14)  Optional background subtraction is possible before calculating/plotting:  15)  Ratios can be plotted for two-channel data:  16)  ROI ratio data can be calibrated to ion concentrations, e.g. [Ca++] from fura-2 ratios, before plotting:  17)  User has control over x and y ranges of graph:  18)  Placement of text and markers on images and graphs is possible:  19) Images and graphs print out easily on user's demand:  20) Graph data can be output to an ASCII file.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of date of notice to Dee Lunney at the above address for consideration by the agency.  Response must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
OMBUDSMAN 
 All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If the contacting officer does not satisfy your concerns, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.  The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. The following describes the proposed Construction Manager As Constructor (CMc) Contract for the renovation of the Richard B. Russell Federal Building & Courthouse located in Atlanta GA. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-construction Phase Services and the option for Construction Phase Services.  A Fixed-Price Incentive (Successive Targets) contract under FAR 16.403-2 is contemplated.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Advisory Multi-step (FAR 15.202), and Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures. For this contract, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. (FAR 15.101-1 trade-offs).  Project Summary.  The proposed modernization will be performed at the existing Federal Building, which is a 24 floor, steel frame structure with approximately 1,281,446 gross square feet. The project includes, but is not limited to, the complete removal of asbestos containing pipe insulation and floor tiles; HVAC system upgrades; electrical system upgrades; interior remodeling to include new partitions, carpeting, floor tiles, lay in-ceilings, waterproofing, doors and hardware. Estimated combined (pre-construction and optional construction phase) project cost range is $25,000,000 to $30,000,000. This procurement is being solicited on an unrestricted basis and is opened to participation by both large and small business concerns. The applicable Standard Industrialized Classification Code for this procurement is 1542 with a size standard of $17 million.  Funds are not currently available for this project.  The government anticipates that funding will be made available for the Pre-Construction Services around March 2002, and for Construction Services in fiscal year 2003.  Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor. The Construction Manager as Constructor, or CMc, is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the planning, design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer, GSA?s selected A-E firm, and other GSA consultants.  Proposal Submission Requirements. Proposals will be evaluated using a two-stage, advisory multi-step process (FAR 15.202).  Under Stage I, offers must submit information regarding the firm?s qualifications including past performance, past experience, resources, and key personnel experience.  Submissions shall clearly address the rating factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP). The Government will evaluate Stage I submissions to identify and advise the offers about their potential to be viable competitors.

Under Stage II, offers must submit additional information identified in the Stage II RFP. The Stage II evaluation will be based on technical factors as well as price. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  Oral presentations and a brief interview will be required as part of the Stage II technical evaluation process. Oral presentations by offerors may substitute for, or augment, written information. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The following evaluation factors will be evaluated and scored.

<DESC>On December 17, 2002 the President of the United States directed the Department of Defense to begin fielding initial missile defense capabilities in 2004-2005.  To execute this direction, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Raytheon for a forward based radar.  IAW Far 6.302-1(a)(ii)(B), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, Raytheon is the only source capable of providing existing X-band phased array technology based on the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) design and can go into production immediately without development. The radar will provide early acquisition and tracking of ballistic missiles that may be launched against the United States, deployed forces, friends and allies.  The radar will be suitable for the forward deployed BMDS mission and will be integrated into the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  Data from this radar will be provided to the Command and Control Ballistic Management Communications (C2BMC) network for engagement planning and forwarded to other sensors for continuation of coverage.  This radar will be a transportable, X-Band, phased array radar with sufficient sensitivity to detect, track, and discriminate threat missiles.  Existing technology for the hardware and software production will be leveraged.  This capability will be delivered by second quarter FY05 and operational NLT December 2007 to meet Block 06 milestones.  Production must begin by April 1, 2003.  Anticipated cost is $600-$800M for base and option periods. See Note 22.

However, all written responses received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<ARCHDATE>04172003
<CONTACT>John Striano  215-697-9603
<DESC>FISC Norfolk Det Philadelphia will be conducting an industry forum in Philadelphia, PA on 19 March 2003 at 9:00 AM EST.  Industry is invited to attend the conference to comment on the upcoming Engine Tracking requirement on behalf of the Naval Support Activity, Philadelphia, PA. Anyone interested in attending must contact John Striano at FISC Norfolk Det Philadelphia, (215) 697-9603 no later than 18 March 2003. The intent of the proposed engine tracking solicitation is to ascertain the feasibility of and projected costs to expedite, monitor, transport, and report on the movement of an estimated 2000 annual ready-for-issue (RFI) and non-RFI aircraft engine and engine module movements.  This effort does not include local movements of less than 50 miles.  For shipments originating Outside Continental United States (OCONUS), movement will occur from Continental United States (CON US) Air Mobility Command (AMC) ports at Naval Station (NS) Norfolk, VA; Travis Air Force Base (AFB), CA; Dover AFB, DE; McGuire AFB, NJ; Charleston AFB, SC; and McChord AFB, WA for further transfer to destination.  Movements are primarily made between Naval Air Stations, commercial and organic repair sites, defense depots, and AMC ports. Visibility of all movements must be achieved by feeding pick up and delivery data to the Global Transportation Network (GTN).  The contractor is expected to coordinate and monitor the movement of all aircraft engines and engine modules moving within CONUS.  Engines and engine modules range from 150 to 9000 lbs (see attach 1) and some require flatbed to move.  Transit times should not exceed an average of 3 business days from notification (before 12 noon) for movements moving between 50 and 1000 miles and an average of 5 business days for mov ements over 1000 miles.  Contractor is responsible for being able to identify the location of the shipments during transit and providing signed proof of deliveries upon request.  The contractor will establish a link between GTN and NAVAIR’s Aircraft Engine Management System (AEMS). A recent study showed that of 553 in-transit engines more than 5 days old, 305 of the transfers had Transportation Control Numbers (TCNs).  Of the 305 transfers with TCNs, 123 were not yet visible in GTN, and numerous transfers had improperly formatted TCNs.  Therefore, one of the biggest problems is proper TCN assignment.  The Contractor must address this problem in their proposal- including a plan on how coordination with squadrons, AMC, commercial contractors, the Defense Logistics Agency, Navy Transportation Officers, and other holders of aircraft engines might resolve this problem. In summ ary, Navy is interested in movement, visibility, and accountability for aircraft engine and engine module movements within CONUS, Navy goals are to reduce transit time, increase in-transit visibility, develop reporting capabilities, and eliminate loss of assets.

When illegal drugs are discovered in the course of an inspection or search of a vehicle operated by a contractor, the contractor and vehicle may be detained for a reasonable period of time necessary to surrender the individual and vehicle to appropriate civil law enforcement personnel.  Action may be taken to suspend working privileges as well as installation driving privileges.  Implicit with the acceptance of this contract is the agreement by the contractor to comply with all Federal and State laws as well as regulation issued by the commander of the military installation concerning illegal drugs and paraphernalia.   5.

Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4767, email: Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative approaches in the area of advanced radar technology that will overcome deficiencies in existing and planned radar systems to detect, track, and identify aircraft, missiles, spacecraft, space debris, ground vehicles, and subsurface complexes in clutter and countermeasure environments.  The survivability of new and existing systems must also be improved without the use of decoys.  Upgrades to existing ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) Platforms and demonstrations to support transition to the next level of technology development, and evolutions to new sensors and concepts (Unmanned Air Vehicles, Space Based Platforms, etc.) need to be addressed.  Sensor concepts should include multiple configurations with characteristics supporting diverse multimission requirements including Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Multiband SAR/Tomographic Imaging features, and Foliage Penetrating (FOPEN) Radar.  These concepts include both Monostatic and Multistatic solutions.  Lookdown Bistatic concepts should include bistatic receivers using radiators of opportunity (TV, FM etc.) with large wideband receive antennas.  Areas of interest include new and innovative advances in system architectures, hardware, software and/or signal processing algorithm improvements, diverse transmit waveforms, survivability, positional estimation improvements, unique concepts in radar system design, Multi-Basing Look Down Surveillance (Air and Space), Augmentation of Reconnaissance Capabilities (development of new surveillance capabilities in Reconnaissance sensors), Ground Penetrating Radar, Bistatic/Multistatic Radar (Non-cooperative emitter stand alone sensors and Cooperative augmentation of existing ISR Platforms through UAVs), the architecture and signal processing for expendable UAV radar probes and theater missile defense.  Additional technology areas include the measurement, test, analysis and modeling efforts that are required to support the development of advanced radar systems. The primary emphasis is to identify and demonstrate promising technologies for both monostatic and multistatic radar sensors in the areas of Space Time Adaptive Processing, both Adaptive and Knowledge Based (KB), Multi-Channel Signal Processing Techniques, Innovative and Wideband Processing Techniques, Multi-Dimensional Processing Techniques, Improved radar system performance developments in spread doppler clutter environment for a theater application and, in general, technologies that may significantly improve the performance of advanced radar systems.  In some cases, AFRL Rome may be able to provide further information.  Contact the technical POC.  The successful application of these approaches will require a broad spectrum of expertise, covering hardware, software, and systems technology.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a).  All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch Offerors must mark their submissions with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission.  All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Elaine C. Kordyban, Rome Research Site/SNRD, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome NY 13441-4514 and reference BAA-03-05-IFKA. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. This BAA is open and effective until 30 Sep 06. It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award. White papers for FY03 should be submitted by 15 Apr 03. White papers for the out years should be submitted as follows:  FY 04 – 15 Apr; FY 05 – 15 Apr 05; and, FY 06 – 15 Apr 06. White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective Fiscal Year after the dates cited.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. The following criteria will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Best Value - Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  Also, consideration will be given to other factors such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  All responsible organizations may submit a white paper/proposal which shall be considered.  Awards of efforts as a result of this BAA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award. Complete instructions for proposal preparation will be forwarded with the invitations for proposal submissions.  Principal funding of this BAA and the anticipated award of contracts will start approximately the third quarter of FY03.  Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts ranging between  $100,000 to $1M per year.  The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows:  FY 03 - $8M; FY 04 - $14M; FY 05 - $14M; and, FY 06 - $13.9M.  Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M.  An informational briefing/industry day is not planned. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 03-08-IFKA.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Arnold Kloven, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.  Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals.  Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a.  Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b.  Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c.

<DESC>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM).   The Department of Commerce, through both its Commercial Service and its Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), has requested USTDA assistance for the development of projects related to the U.S. Coast Guard’s new integrated deepwater system and its applicability to southern African states.  Over the next two decades, the U.S. Coast Guard will modernize its aging fleet of ships, aircraft, helicopters and their sensors, and communications and logistics infrastructure in a seventeen billion dollar acquisition program, known as the Integrated Deepwater System Program or “Deepwater”.  The Deepwater Program will provide an affordable solution to the multi-faceted maritime needs of the United States and the international community.  The U.S Department of Commerce is assisting the U.S. Coast Guard in the promotion of the Deepwater cooperation internationally.  Growing economic and security requirements, including environmental and fisheries protection, search and rescue operations, and counter-terrorism cooperation highlight the necessity for U.S. partnership with the Southern African states regarding marine resources and exclusive economic zones (EEZ).  There has been interest in developing this initiative by government ministries in South Africa, Namibia, and Mozambique, as well as general interest from other African countries in the region. USTDA seeks to contract with a U.S. firm (Contractor) to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) to analyze potential projects in the region.

The Contractor will be required to travel to Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique to scope out potential projects that may meet the requirements of USTDA funding.  Prior to traveling, the Contractor will be required to consult with USTDA COTR, USTDA’s regional office in Johannesburg, and the Bureau of Industry and Security.  The Contractor shall evaluate the financing ability of the projects; the development priority of the projects for the host country; the U.S. export potential of the projects; and the general strengths and weaknesses of the individual projects.  In addition, the Contractor will examine all other USTDA funding criteria and will develop a budget and terms of reference for each project recommended to USTDA for funding.
 
The Contractor must demonstrate a broad range of experience that includes experience in at least the general sectors that will be covered in the Definitional Mission.  The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the potential projects.  In addition, knowledge of Portuguese is required.  If the Contractor does not have Portuguese fluency within the team, Portuguese translation must be addressed in the proposal and budget.  It is expected that a team of at least two persons will be required to successfully accomplish this multi-sector mission.

The estimated cost for this work does not exceed $40,000.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) promotes American private sector participation in developing middle-income countries, with special emphasis on economic sectors that represent significant U.S. export potential.  Through funding a variety of activities, USTDA helps U.S. businesses compete for infrastructure and capacity building projects in emerging markets and supports U.S. policy objectives.

USTDA assists in building mutually beneficial partnerships between American companies and overseas project sponsors that result in increased U.S. exports, jobs, and the completion of high quality successful projects in host countries.  

The Small Business Act, at 15, U.S.C. 252, authorizes procuring agencies to set aside procurements or portions of procurements for the exclusive participation of Small Businesses Concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541330.
Definition: “Small business concerns” for purposes of USTDA award of this total set aside contract means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operating for which it is bidding.  In determining whether dominance exists for USTDA’s purpose for this contract, consideration is given to annual gross receipts.  Any concern with an annual gross receipts above $5 million dollars, averaged over a three year period, is not considered small and is therefore, NOT eligible for award under this contract.

All participating organizations involved with supplying professional services must be incorporated or chartered in the United States.  Consultants planning teaming arrangements must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens.  In accordance with FAR 19.301, offerors will be required to submit self-certification relating to business size.  The competitive proposals method of solicitation as set forth in Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR Chapter 1) shall be utilized for this procurement.  This solicitation does not obligate USTDA to award a contract, nor does it commit USTDA to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of the proposal.  Any explanation desired by an offeror regarding the meaning or interpretation of this solicitation must be requested in writing and with sufficient time allowed for reply to reach the offerors before submission of their offerors.  All oral explanations or instruction, given before award of this contract will not be binding.  Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning the solicitation will be furnished promptly to all prospective offerors as an amendment of the solicitation, if such information is necessary to offerors submitting proposals or if lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed offerors.

The contractor must be in the position to present fair and unbiased information pursuant to the statement of work.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include the evaluationc criteria for award.  All other information pertaining to this effort may be viewed on the orginal notice.

EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR AWARD (IAW FAR 13.106-2(b), 14.201-5(c), and 15.204-5(c).  For the purposes of award, offers will be evaluated based on the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:  Price or Cost.
Evaluation of Proposed Prices for Option Ranges  

The proposed unit prices for each quantity range for each item of each Option Period in Section B will be evaluated by subtracting the lowest number in each range from the highest number in the range, then adding a quantity of one to arrive at the # of evaluated units in each range.  The # of evaluated units from each range will then be multiplied by the proposed unit price for that range to arrive at the extended amount. 

These same type of calculations will be accomplished for each item for each Ordering Period.  The total evaluated amount will be the sum of evaluated prices for each item in each ordering period.

The evaluation described in this provision will form the base for any additional evaluation factors identified elsewhere in this solicitation (e.g. transportation evaluation, etc).

<DESC>Questions and answers for #FUTRSS30130200


1.  Does the software already have to exist? Yes, the vendor must provide the software and instructions on how to use it.  The government is looking for an item off the shelf.


2.  If not, how long does the vendor have to develop the software? N/A


3.  What platform is the software to be installed in? Windows 2000


4.  Does the software have to be written in a specific language? No


5.  Verify whether 7 IR Base Station Transceivers are required, i.e. 1 for each of the 7 rooms. Yes.


6.  Clarify "8 hours of training" - Does this include both installation, testing, and training of the product to both instructors and students? Training is for instructors to learn how to set up the hardware and how to use all of the features of the software and hardware. The trainer should ensure the hardware and software is properly installed prior to training taking place.


7.  Will the OptionPower System be used for any other specific programs we should be aware of, besides games (Jeopardy, Millionaire), quizzes, and existing power point courseware files?  No.
	

8.  When is the approximate contract award and when will be the approximate time for performance? Award takes place after closing on 24 March 2003.  Due to class requirements, software must be in hand 60 days after date of contract.


9.  What is the duration of contract performance? Hardware and software delivery may occur at any time prior to training. Training shall occur within 2 months of contract award.


10.  Will technical support and maintenance be required during contract performance? Yes, consistent with the offeror’s hardware warranty and technical support that is normally offered with software purchase.  Warranty should be the normal warranty period offered to all customers who purchase the hardware and software requested.


11.  Will contract performance only occur within Vandenberg AFB, or should other military facilities be anticipated?  At VAFB only.


12.  Will the Air Force be providing the "approval for use of this hardware/software package in a classified environment"? Yes, transparent to the offeror. There is no requirement for the offeror or the offeror’s agents to have a clearance or for the hardware/software be certified for operation in a classified environment.



13.  Are the cadets in each room competing with cadets in the other rooms or just in teams within one room? For purposes of this RFP, all contestants are located in the same room with line-of-sight to the base station receiver.


14.  Are the seven rooms in an existing structure or is that have to be built and by whom? Structures are existing.


15.  Do we need to supply the computers to run the software? If we provide the computers, how many do we need to provide? The requirement is for the solution to be portable with a minimal setup period (to include software loading). This needs to be accomplished with the government’s computers in place in our classrooms; no additional computers need to be provided. 


16.  Which operating system and software packages are needed besides those that are required by OptionPower? We use Windows 2000 and the standard Microsoft Office Suite. We also use classrooms with SMARTboard technology and Syncroneyes software for projection purposes.


17.  Will the computers be connected via LAN?  If so, who does the wiring?  Is there a need for a computer server? The computers are connected to the existing LAN. 
No computer server is required.


18.  How will the "game" be displayed-- via television or video projector? High-resolution video projector.


19.  Also, do we provide the furnishings?  If so, how are the rooms to be set up?  Folding chairs, desks, regular chairs, etc.? Classrooms are furnished already with all of the normal furniture. Training will occur in a classroom with similar characteristics.


20.  We are a small business.  If we are awarded the contract, when and how will we be paid?  We would need at least a partial payment to procure the necessary items to fulfill the contract?  As to payment, we do not pay up front on any of our contracts.  We could pay partial upon receipt of equipment (pay for the equipment) then after installation (pay for installation) or training.  Normal pay time frame is 30 days after date of invoice.  If needed sooner, must be put in discount terms.

<CONTACT>Carl Culham, Supervisory Contract Specialist, Phone (503) 668-1667, Fax (503) 668-1763, Email cculham@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This solicitation is to provide services to decommission Roads 1015 and 1027 in the Bull Run Watershed on the Mount Hood National Forest.  Road decommissioning is to be accomplished by hydraulic track-mounted excavators, crawler-tractors (dozers), and dump trucks.  Culvert removal will involve excavation of approximately 25 large culverts, which carry live streams.  The volume of excavation is estimated at 500 – 2000 cubic yards per culvert.  Stream diversion will be required to protect water quality.  Following earthwork, exposed soil is to be seeded with weed-free annual rye grass seed (Lolium multiflorum) and mulched with weed-free annual rye grass straw or wheat straw.  Seed shall be applied at the rate of 50 lb./acre.  The contractor shall provide State of Oregon certification of species and purity for both seed and mulch.

An overall plan of work must be submitted, with the contract bid, including: a description of each piece of equipment to be used, a schedule of work with an estimated number of work days for each section of road, and a general plan for stream diversion and water quality control. Due to restricted access to the work site, the contractor will also be required to attend a mandatory Pre-Solicitation Meeting/Site Visit to be held on April 23, 2003.
  
Necessary roads may be minimally cleared of brush, downed trees, etc. to facilitate access to work sites.  Live streams will be diverted from excavated areas to prevent soil from entering the waterway.  A water quality control plan must be submitted and approved for each stream diversion prior to the start of excavation.  Such plans must include a sketch of the stream channel showing how water is to be diverted and a description of the equipment to be used.  Required equipment may include piping, sandbags, plastic sheeting, pumps, hoses and filters.  

A log stringer bridge is to be removed at milepost 4.0, road 1015.  Bridge materials and road surfacing will be disposed of at a nearby site designated by the COR.  Channel banks are to be re-contoured as directed by the COR.  A plan of operation and water quality control must also be submitted and approved by the COR prior to the start of bridge demolition.  Due to safety concerns, this bridge is currently closed to vehicle traffic.

The Contractor shall be responsible for all repairs, maintenance, and operating supplies required in the use of the equipment, as well as furnishing all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, and incidentals to perform all work specified herein.  Should the need for repairs develop, such repairs will be accomplished within two (2) calendar days or the equipment shall be replaced with a comparable piece of equipment at no additional cost to the Government. The contractor will also be responsible for all signing and barricades for traffic control. For more detailed information of specified work, refer to the plans.  This project will be available April 7, 2003.

Modification:  The pre-bid meeting is scheduled for April 23, 2003.  Everyone will meet in the Headquarters Office Parking Lot, Mt. Hood National Forest, 16400 Champion Way, Sandy, OR  97055 at 9 a.m.  From there everyone will go to the site for the meeting which is planned to be from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.
We estimate this project to be between $250,000 and $500,000.

<RESPDATE>040103
<ARCHDATE>05312003
<CONTACT>Robert Lavelle, 703-614-4578
<DESC>NA OSD Defense Challenge Program has been established to provide opportunities for the increased introduction of innovative and cost-saving technologies, products, or processes into existing Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition programs.  The Defense Chall enge Program provides any person, organization, or government activity within or outside the DOD the opportunity to propose: alternative technologies, product improvements, or enhanced processes.  Opportunities proposed, known as Challenge Proposals, at th e component, subsystem, or system level of an existing DOD acquisition program, will be evaluated for resulting improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability of that acquisition program.  Challenge Proposals will be evaluated under the guidelines outlined in Title 10 USC Section 2359b Defense Acquisition Challenge Program.  This Broad Area Announcement (BAA) is open to any technology, product, or process that demonstrates a near-term (12-18 months after project inc eption) potential to improve existing acquisitions for any DoD activity.  The evaluation of Challenge Proposals will be conducted in two phases: (1) In the FIRST PHASE, persons, organizations, and government activities interested in participating will subm it a document called a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program (DACP) Summary Proposal.  A DACP Summary Proposal is a three- to five-page abstract or summary of the proposed project.  It will include: 1) a description of the technology, product, or process t o be evaluated, 2) a summary of its capabilities and the potential benefit(s) to the program of inserting the technology/product/process, 3) identification of the DOD Acquisition Category (ACAT) designation of the program that the capabilities will be alig ned and/or incorporated against, 4) a cost estimate, including methodology, for the test article acquisition or proposed technology or process improvement, and 5) current maturity state of proposed project, including estimated test phases for evaluation ap proach.  A Quad Chart is required and the format can be retrieved on the DCAP Bids website (www.bids.acqcenter.com/dacp).  Although not required, a letter of interest from the DOD Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the AC AT program is strongly encouraged and will be considered in evaluating the proposal.  All Summary Proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review.  Evaluation criteria for project selection at the Summary Proposal Phase are: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the proposal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system level of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposa l could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an acceptable cost, and without unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program.  Summary proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above, and show the greatest potential in providing innovative and cost-saving technologies, products, or processes into existing Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition programs will be forwarded to the acquisition program identified in the proposal.  The DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prim e system contractor carrying out the program, will decide whether to sponsor the proposal.  (2) In the SECOND PHASE, persons, organizations, and government activities submitting DACP Summary Proposals that meet the requirements as outlined above and are ad opted by the acquisition program, will be extended an invitation to work with the DoD sponsor to submit a complete technical and cost Defense Acquisition Challenge Program Final Proposal for the planned project.  The DACP Final Proposal will include: key p erformance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet); test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a pl an for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology/product/process into the acquisition program; cost product test article acquisition or lease, technology or process; a cost profile for the test and evaluation of the technology/product/pr ocess for the intended application.  The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technology/process into the acquisition progra m.  During the second phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all Final Challenge Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b.  The Government review of the Challenge Proposals at the second  and final phase will include all criteria listed above as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property is sues associated with the challenge proposal.  Proposals will be selected for funding, based on assessment, DOD ACAT Program test and evaluation, and the availability of Government funding.  Approximately $12 million is available for all FY2003 projects; th us, funding for participation is highly competitive, and cost of proposed technology/product/process should be considered.  The final number of projects and respective funds allocated will be determined once all final proposals have been received and evalu ated.  Those projects that are not funded in FY03 but are considered viable will automatically be reviewed during the FY04 process that begins in May 2003.  Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified in all cases.  Information an d Summary Proposal submittal is available on the DACP website at: www.bids.acqcenter.com/dacp.  This website has further information on the Quad Chart, Summary Challenge Proposal format, Final Challenge Proposal format, submission instructions, and other i nformation as required.  Summary Challenge Proposals must be received/submitted via the DACP website no later than 1500 hours local time (3:00PM EST) on 1 April 2003.  Notification of rejections will be emailed to the submitter. In general, debriefings of the summary proposals are not anticipated.  It should be generally assumed; that the reason a proposal was not considered for further review was due to funding availability or it did not meet the requirements for Defense Challenge.  Proposals will be evalu ated on a first-come-first served basis.  This announcement must not be construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offer that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract . The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Procedures for Classified Information:  If a submittal contains classified information, the offeror must firs t obtain a submittal number through BIDS for tracking purposes and identify in the comments section why the submittal cannot be uploaded and submitted via the automated system.

<DESC>Request for both sources sought and comments on DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), Building Operations and Maintenance, for the A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for the daily building operations and maintenance of six (6) IRS sites – the Headquarters building in downtown Washington DC, and five campuses in Austin, TX; Covington, KY; Fresno, CA; Ogden , UT; and Philadelphia, PA. 

OBJECTIVE:
The Internal Revenue Service has two objectives for submitting this notice.  The first objective is to obtain industry comments on the DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS) for an A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study for the daily building operations and maintenance of the six locations identified in the description.  The Government is currently performing this work.  The Government will consider all information received when preparing a final PWS; however, any and all changes are at the sole discretion of the Government.  In addition to comments to the draft PWS, please address the following:

1.  Proposal preparation period.  Length of time you believe you will need to prepare a proposal to adequately address all requirements;
2.  Contract term (length).  Typically, a service contract has a one-year base period and 4 one-year option periods.  Provide the advantages and disadvantages for having more than 4 one-year option periods;  
3.  Appropriate performance incentives.  Provide possible performance incentives and the advantages and disadvantages of each suggested incentive.  NOTE:  Incentives included in the best value private-to-private competition must also be incorporated into the Government’s Most Efficient Organization (MEO’s) proposal in order to compare like proposals for a cost comparison and final selection; and, 
4.  Any additional information you need from the IRS that would assist you in pursuing this effort as a business opportunity.

Any information provided is voluntary.  As such, the Government will not cover any costs for any information or inquiry submitted as a result of this request.  Should the Government have questions regarding individual responses, the responder will be contacted for further information.  Please include the name of a point of contact, e-mail address and telephone number of this person.  This is DRAFT PWS and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a FORMAL RFP, RFQ or contract.  The DRAFT PWS is available at the following IRS internet site o/a 8:30 a.m. EST on March 18, 2003:  http://www.procurement.irs.treas.gov  (under Business Opportunities).  All comments regarding the PWS and associated documents should be e-mailed to AWSS.RFI.BDM@irs.gov.  Only electronic comments will be accepted.

The second objective is to obtain capability statements, based upon the requirements outlined in the DRAFT PWS, of all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.   The acquisition under this A-76 study will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 561210, Facilities Support Services which establishes a small business size standard of $6.0M.  All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capability statement of no more than ten pages to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined in the DRAFT PWS. Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to provide the required services at all six (6) IRS sites, including information on key staff experience and a description of corporate experience with similar projects of like size; complexity; and geographic coverage.  In order for the IRS to assess set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contract, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses for points of contact, and identifies the company as one or more of the following based on the business size standard above: (1) small business; (2) 8(a) business; (3) HUBZone small business; (4) small disadvantaged business; (5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business.

The IRS is contemplating the use of an "all or none" strategy in the award of this requirement.  Comments are encouraged and requested from all business types, but especially from small business concerns, as to the impact of an "all or none" strategy would have on (1) a small business' ability to bid as a prime contractor on this requirement, (2) a small business' ability to manage six disparate sites under one contract, (3) a small business' ability to comply with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause requirement, FAR 52.219-14 in the management of one contract, (4) a small business' interest in submitting a proposal under an "all or none" strategy versus a "multiple award" strategy of awarding two or more "stand alone" contracts, covering one or more work sites.
  
Please note: A SOLICITATION DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS TIME. 

All comments and capability statements should be provided via e-mail no later than April 17, 2003 at 4:00 p.m. PT.  Only electronic responses sent to the following e-mail address will be accepted.  E-mail address is AWSS.RFI.BDM@irs.gov.   E-mail responses requiring more than 5megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.

<SUBJECT>R--Workshop Manager - Scientist
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to use University scientists and the facilities at the University of Arizona for a workshop to be held March 25, 2003 through March 27, 2003.  The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is University of Arizona, ADDRESS.  A justification for other than full and open competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. The following statement of work applies to this requirement:  1. General Requirement:  Manager-Scientist Workshop to be held in Tucson, Arizona,  (a)  Meeting Space.  (1)  Plenary Session.  The workshop planners envision a "plenary" session in which 85 to 125 scientists and managers will meet to discuss the 2002 wildland fire season, including the Rodeo-Chediski fire.  The plenary session shall have conference capability including seating arrangements and facilities to include sound system, large screen projection capability, and adequate tables and chairs for the estimated number of participants.  (2)  Breakout Sessions.  The participants will be broken into six sub groups based on functional areas of pre-fire, fire, and post-fire management (such as air quality and smoke management, and fire and fuels management).  The purpose of the breakout sessions is to identify and prioritize research needs in each of six functional areas.  Each breakout session will require seating and work facilities for six to 20 participants.  (b)  Organization and Management of Workshop.  The Contractor shall manage all workshop logistics including workshop registration, information packet design and contents, development and issuance letters of invitation, media relations, identification and hosting of the breakout groups, and note-taking of proceedings of the breakout sessions.  (c)  Equipment.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all sound equipment (see item 1), flip charts and name tags.  (d)  Pre-Work and Related Materials, and Expertise of University Scientists.  (1)  The Contractor shall provide adequate professional papers and related materials to ensure each participant will be current and well informed regarding the wildland fire issues germane to the geographic area.  The expertise of university scientists shall be provided to ensure independent and professional approach to problem solving.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $35,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, but serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 541990 applies. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAQ032305.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested items at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by March 31, 2003 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with University of Arizona for the requirements stated here.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Kay Ryan at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<SUBJECT>R -- USDA Express Review Studies for Clerical Support and Mailroom Support
<DESC>NOTE:  PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED NRCS-9-MD-03 (MAILROOM SUPPORT SERVICES) WAS ERRONEOUSLY SUBMITTED AS A SOURCES SOUGHT -- SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SPECIAL NOTICE.

BEGIN THIS NOTICE:  The Natural Resources Conservation Service-Maryland State Office (NRCS-MSO) intends to conduct two separate cost comparisons in accordance with OMB-approved USDA Express Review Study procedures.  The studies are for clerical support functions (NAICS Code 561410) and mailroom support functions (NAICS Code 561210) in Annapolis, Maryland.  Major clerical support tasks include general office support functions (telephone, reception, typing, filing, copying, mail, faxing, mail distribution), processing training and travel requests, maintain office bulletin board, and basic clerical research.  Major mailroom support tasks include general mailroom operations (receiving, sorting, distributing, collecting, and sending mail), office reproduction services, vehicle maintenance services, and pickup and delivery services.  The USDA Express Review process is based on the assumption that the commercial activity under study is regularly performed under contract by commercial activities at firm fixed prices and that existing Federal contracts can be used, with only minor modification, to level and define the scope of the competition and avoid the need to develop a new PWS or a formal solicitation.  NRCS-MSO is seeking to locate commercial businesses that have experience and also have current government contracts for (a) clerical support services and (b) mailroom support services.  All interested and capable parties that have expertise in (a) clerical support services and (b) mailroom support services should respond VIA E-MAIL to the contract specialist depburn@md.usda.gov with a list of their 1)contract number 2)Federal Agency name and point of contact 3)the firm fixed price of each contract 4)the period of performance covered and 5)the size and business status.  NOTE:  This is NOT A SOLICITATION or request for proposals; however, depending on the results of the streamlined cost comparison, a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Any questions should be submitted via E-MAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Deborah Hepburn.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request For Information (RFI) Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) Rehost
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide comments on the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) and other documentation that will be available at http://www.dfas.mil/aso/contract/ for the rehosting of the Mechanization of Contract Administrative Services (MOCAS) System.  DFAS is contemplating a firm fixed priced contract vehicle. 

MOCAS is an automated integrated financial and contract administration system developed in the late 1960’s and enhanced over the years to maintain regulatory compliance.  The system has over 8,600 authorized end users from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other DoD components who access the system from locations worldwide.  MOCAS resides on a DISA mainframe at Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) and consists of three separate databases (MOCH, MOCL, MOCG) that serve two regions; East and West.  Each database has its own copy of executables (programs) and job control language (JCL).  MOCAS consists of both interactive on-line and batch system processing.  The primary mainframe programming languages are COBOL and MANTIS.  There are other interfaces, mid-tier, and desktop programs that operate using a variety of other languages and that are critical to the overall functions and support of MOCAS.  There are approximately 1.8 million lines of code per database.  However, the code is, in large part, mirrored in each of the three databases. 

The Government does not intend to issue a solicitation or award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for any information received in response to this RFI.  Any information received in response to this RFI that is marked propriety will be handled accordingly.  Information submitted under this RFI will not be returned.  

A presolicitation conference will be held at the DFAS Columbus Conference Center, Building 21, at 12:00 on March 31, 2003.  For directions, please contact the DFAS POC, below.  Firms that intend to participate in the presolicitation conference are asked to provide the company’s full name, business size, address, company point of contact, and a list of attendees not later than March 26, 2003 to the DFAS POC:

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-12. This is an unrestricted procurement. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price supply contract using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to obtain component parts for the 4,000 pound Jumbo Piston Coring (JPC) system installed onboard CGC HEALY.  The JPC system is a highly specialized piece of scientific equipment used to obtain ocean floor core samples in the deep ocean. The JPC system installed on board CGC HEALY was designed and manufactured by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). Some drawings of a limited portion of the WHOI system, not suitable for use as manufacturing drawings, are available for inspection at URL ftp://icefloe.net/outgoing/jpc_drawings/. No additional drawings of the remainder of the system, its components, manufacturing specifications, schematics, or other system descriptions are available from this agency. The JPC system components required include: 1. Two extruder-compatible JPC core heads (including cradles), weight = 4000 pounds. 2. One trigger arm with cast bronze clamps and hydro-release. 3. Twenty core barrels (1026 seamless cold drawn tubing, 5.25D inch O.D. X 4.550 inch I.D.). 4. Sixteen core barrel couplings (dimetcote & epoxy finish, 4130 tubing). 5. Two core head/barrel couplings (dimetcote & epoxy finish, 4130 tubing). 6. Two core cutter/catcher assemblies. 7. Two stainless steel pistons w/ stops. 8. Ten extruder rods, and one TOP Rod. 9. Three Pilot Weights. 10. Two Lifting Collars. The successful operation of this scientific equipment is essential for CGC HEALY to complete its science mission. It is the government’s belief that only WHOI is capable of providing JPC system components that will enable CGC HEALY to complete its mission. Interchangeability of components between the existing WHOI JPC system and components being procured is mission essential. The form, fit, and function of the components being procured must be exactly compatible and interchangeable with the existing JPC system. All potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities to manufacture JPC system components to WHOI specifications are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Award will be made on a best-value basis. Technical and price proposals are required. Technical merit is significantly more important than price. Technical proposals shall provide complete information regarding the contractor’s knowledge of the details of construction of the existing WHOI JPC system, its ability to manufacture a JPC system to WHOI specifications, and past performance in the manufacture of JPC systems to WHOI specifications. Proposals which merely offer to produce the components and provide a price quotation but which do not include the required technical information will not be considered. Proposals shall also include the proposed delivery date of all components to the place of delivery in Seattle, WA, the company Tax Information Number and DUNS Number. Place of delivery is USCG Naval Engineering Support Unit Seattle, 1519 Alaskan Way South, Seattle, WA 98134-1192. Delivery of all items must occur not later than 02 JUNE 2003.
