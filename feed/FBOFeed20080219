<DESC>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618; the activity description is "Other Management Consulting Services"; and the small business size standard is $6.5 million. The Bureau of Reclamation's Ephrata Field Office (Reclamation) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract for advisory, assistance, and consulting services with Mr. Edmund Kemp  to assist Reclamation with his knowledge and expertise and as a witness during litigation by submitting court and other documents and affidavits in support of Reclamation's programs including water rights claims and proof of appropriations, in the matter of CV. No. 06-204-RHW brought by Grant County Black Sands Irrigation District, et al., (BSID). The work required is as follows: 1. Research historical documents, court orders, memorandum opinions, judgments, and legislative record and authorizations. 2. Prepare in draft and final format correspondence, reports, opinions, and records pertaining to water rights, water usage and water contracting activities. 3. Provide expertise to the Field Solicitor and Department of Justice. 4. Locate project data to be used in the preparation of affidavits and briefs for submittal to the court. This work will be performed by the contractor using unique knowledge gained over 3 previous lawsuits filed by the BSID.  In addition, Mr. Kemp was the staff member primarily associated with the program at the time of establishment of the Quincy Groundwater Management program, including the groundwater licenses and yearly billing of charges.  Reclamation requires the services of a contractor who has in-depth knowledge of Reclamation's water rights, legislative authorizations, historical precedents and regulations, repayment and water service contracts, court decisions, unique State statutes, Federal contracts and Acts of Congress affecting the water rights in the Columbia Basin Project and throughout north-central Washington, Idaho and Montana.  Reclamation also requires specific knowledge of the inter-relationship between State and Federal water law as it pertains to ground and surface water rights, the contractual relationships and roles of Reclamation and its contracting water entities and individuals.  Because of Reclamation's contractual obligations to other water users throughout the Project and Field Office area and the complexity of the water rights and contracting processes, it is not possible to find other contractors capable of providing for our immediate needs. Because of this,  it is to the Government's interest to acquire the services of Mr. Kemp The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties that are certain they can meet the requirement must submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.  All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  All proposals received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation.

<DESC>Description

The MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility will produce completed Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel assemblies for use in domestic, commercial nuclear power reactors.  Feed material is uranium dioxide and surplus plutonium dioxide.

The manufacturing area is the MOX Fuel Fabrication Building.  It is a multi-functional complex containing all of the plutonium handling, fuel processing, and fuel fabrication operations of the MFFF. This building includes the Aqueous Polishing Area, the MOX Processing Area, and the Shipping and Receiving Area.

This Expression of Interest (EOI) is for the BAP Mechanical Equipment and Piping installation.  We are seeking subcontractors who are interested in responding to a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the installation of the piping, pipe supports, and associated welded and chemical equipment in this building.

The MFFF design will be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), ensuring compliance with the most stringent design standards.  The NRC's regulations are found in Chapter I of Title 10, "Energy," of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  10 CFR 50 - Appendix B: Quality Assurance Criteria for Nuclear Power Plants and Fuel Reprocessing Plants, and will be applicable to this subcontract.

All work will be performed under the MOX Services Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program.  All QC inspections and Nondestructive Examination (NDE) will be performed by MOX Services.    

A significant portion of the installation will be Quality Level 1.  Firms that wish to submit proposals do not have to have a qualified NQA-1 Quality Assurance Program (American Society of Mechanical Engineers, NQA-1 - 1989 Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities), but should be able to demonstrate their ability and experience performing this type of installation in a stringent QA/QC environment.  

This Mechanical Equipment and Piping Installation project is estimated to be in excess of $40M. 

The installation includes approximately 180,000 linear feet of piping.  Most of this piping is small bore (2 inch and smaller) process piping (stainless steel, titanium, and zirconium), with stainless steel hangers, and associated equipment.  All piping will be installed to ASME B31.3 criteria.

The RFP will solicit proposals on a firm price basis.  

The RFP is scheduled for the 1st quarter FY 2009.  Proposals will be due in the 2nd quarter FY 2009.  The award will be in the 3rd quarter FY 2009.  Actual installation will not start until the 2nd quarter FY 2010 but the Subcontractor is expected to establish a presence on site as soon as the Subcontract is awarded for planning the work and interfacing with the piping fabricator.

Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  If selected for award, the offeror?s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) has a continuing requirement to provide on-going, comprehensive support for two functioning IRBs (one for adult trials and the other for pediatric trials), as well as facilitate new site enrollments and provide support for existing local IRBs participating in the Initiative.  In addition, the Contractor shall facilitate the NCI's efforts to promote the expansion of the Initiative to approximately 600 additional sites currently conducting NCI Cooperative Group trials.

Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:  1) Manage and provide administrative and regulatory support for two Central IRBs (one for adult trials and one for pediatric trials); 2) Manage and support current and newly enrolled local sites; 3) Support the recruitment of new sites and conduct their integration into the Initiative; 4) Provide informatics systems to support all operations; 5) Support communications with NCI and stakeholders regarding all aspects of the Initiative; and 6) Implement and manage an Initiative-wide Quality Improvement Plan.

In addition, the following Optional Tasks may be required of the Contractor:  1) Provide support for obtaining Association for Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs, Inc. (AAHRPP) accreditation in contract year 1 or 2, as determined by NCI; 2) Establish and maintain informatics to support Board meeting responsibilities; 3) Manage and support an additional adult CIRB, if required, as a result of expanding the pool of trials reviewed by the CIRB; 4) Enhance and update CIRB Initiative Informatics system to ensure compliance with the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) principles; 5) Develop and implement a system for utilizing central review for sites that do not have a local IRB; and 6) Contractor should have the flexibility to scale up operations and/or increase staff to address increases in workload due to increase in enrollment (to 400 sites) or number of clinical trials (200 trials on menu).

As these tasks indicate, the Contractor's responsibilities are more complex than the standard management of two central IRBs.  One unusual feature of this Initiative is that every decision the CIRBs make have an impact on the NCI's trial development and distribution system; consequently, all Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) must be integrated with the relevant administrative procedures of the NCI's Protocol Information Office (PIO) in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), the Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU), and the Cooperative Groups' Operations offices.  In addition, due to the high profile of this Initiative, sophisticated data management, analysis and presentation are required throughout all activities in the major tasks listed above.  The Contractor must be prepared on a frequent and often unscheduled basis to provide data to NCI on the current status of any and all activities.

This is a recompetition of a previous requirement and the Government anticipates that one (1) contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of three (3) base years with the ability for the Contractor to earn up to three (3) additional years (Award Terms) based upon successful performance against established criteria.  RFP No. N02-CM-81010-48 will be issued on or about March 5, 2008 with a due date for proposal receipt on or about April 4, 2008.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Office of Acquisitions (OA), NCI, at the following url:  http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcd-internet/ .  The NAICS Code is 541690.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to issue a solicitation limited to educational institutions in the Southeastern Louisiana area  with graduate degree programs related to disciplines described below pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii) for advanced research and development projects. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA intends making a single award. The purpose of this contract is to obtain analytical and technical support services from undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at a geographically local educational institution in support of Advanced Research and Development projects on behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana region.  The solicitation will result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for issuing firm fixed priced task orders.   On behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana and South Mississippi region, the winning contractor shall provide analytical and technical support services in the following disciplines:  Electronic, computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics  Computer Science and information systems  Mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics  Geospatial characterization  Data fusion  Acoustical communications  Industrial/organizational psychology  Modeling and Simulation Customers include, but are not limited to: SPAWARSYSCENNOLA; Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Command; Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Department of Navy Chief Information Office; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Finance Center. The contract will have a base year and four one year options.  The total estimated value of this contract, if all options are exercised, is estimated to be $50,000,000 using Navy Research and Development funds. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) states that full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain essential engineering, research or development capabilities by an educational institution.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has determined that such criteria have been satisfied in this acquisition. As the Navy's center for personnel, pay and manpower systems, research, development, test and evaluation, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has a need to establish and maintain a pool (civilian employment and otherwise) of scientists and engineers interested and capable of maintaining systems critical to the Navy and other military customers.  In order to assist in maintaining this pool of capable scientists and engineers, it is essential that future scientists and engineers receive hands-on training and exposure to Navy RDT&E conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA in the disciplines identified above.  It is essential to the Navy, and particularly the activities receiving these services, to maintain a pool of interested and trained engineers and scientists. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA engineers and scientists attest to the impact predecessor contracts have had on the realization of this goal. Many students exposed to these activities via predecessor contracts returned to support these projects or related work either as contractor employees or directly via the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA' New Professional Program. Employing students specifically from academic institutions will address the essential need for innovation in current RDT&E projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA and with its customers.  The SPAWARSYSCENNOLA  recognizes the importance of scientific investigation through the strategic theme of Innovation. Educational institutions are uniquely positioned to assist SPAWARSYSCENNOLA by providing a source of new and innovative ideas borne of scientific investigation in a rigorous, unbiased academic environment. This procurement will assist in maintaining and providing an essential impartiality and currency in science and engineering services that can only be obtained from educational institutions. Theoretical analysis, exploratory studies and experimentation conducted by students of a relatively unbiased educational institution are potentially superior to that of a for-profit corporation, due to the educational institution's interest and dedication to pure research. For-profit corporations focus on direct economic profit-oriented goals, return on investments, and bottom-line profits as opposed to pure unbiased discovery research. The goals of educational institutions include scientific investigation for its own sake, with broad charters focused on learning and discovery of knowledge within a given area. Educational institutions can focus on investigation and learning for knowledge alone, regardless of any return on investment or practical use of the knowledge acquired. This focus, in turn, fosters innovation. It has been the experience of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA that educational institutions are able to support research and development projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA with a continuing infusion of the very latest academic concepts and ideas at a relatively low cost. Because the cost of employing students is relatively low in comparison to scientific staff from for-profit corporations, many budget constrained projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA would benefit with the participation of students. In many cases, the use of students is not just a cost effective means of stretching project dollars; rather, it is an essential means of accomplishing the mission because project budgets cannot accommodate more expensive labor costs. It should be noted that as SPAWARSYSCENNOLA projects directly benefit from the infusion of innovation and knowledge from an educational institution, there are other essential benefits from the relationship. In February 2006, the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a joint report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."  The report identified alarming trends in the state of American higher education in science and technology; for example:  In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering.  In France, the figure is 47%; in China, 50%; in Singapore, 67%.  In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%.  There has been a 20% decline in science and engineering doctorates awarded to US citizens or permanent residents between 1995 and 2004.  Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary. One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated about 140,000.  China graduated about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in those same fields, while the United States graduated about 85,000 with 2- to 3-year degrees.  Over the past 3 years alone, both China and India have doubled their production of 4-year degrees in engineering while the United States production of engineers is stagnant. Moreover, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has found that the New Orleans area currently has a shortage of experienced scientific and engineering personnel. This contract action is a counterweight to such trends.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA materially participates in multiple projects spanning a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines on behalf of numerous civilian and military agencies of the United States government and private industry concerns.  Much of the work conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA is exclusive to SPAWARSYSCENNOLA.  The unique challenges and opportunities associated with scientific investigation at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA are a significant inducement for students to continue their education in science and technology.  As an intentialconsequence, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA seeks to stimulates and maintain the availability of a critical workforce essential to its mission as a Navy's pre-eminent manpower, personnel and pay information technology support center. In sum, the Navy has a strong interest in establishing and maintaining essential basic engineering and research and development capabilities relevant to Navy applications and interests; therefore, competition shall be restricted to educational institutions in the South East Louisiana region in order to maintain the essential engineering, research and development capabilities vital to the accomplishment of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA missions.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposal Number R-CHI-00943 in support of the HUD headquarters, Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R), Research, Evaluation and Monitoring Division. One indefinite-quantity contract (IQC) is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation for research and analysis of administrative data for a variety of housing and supportive services to measure the impact on homeless families. The purpose of this research effort will be to reach some definitive conclusions as to the minimum combinations of housing and services necessary to effectively produce housing stability and family well-being among variously challenged homeless families.  The inquiry will require conducting a panel study of homeless families with differing levels of challenge that will be exposed to various combinations of housing and supportive services.  Families will be tracked for as long as feasible, using survey research and administrative data to measure impact.  Outcomes will include housing stability, income, and employment, changes in substance use, adult and child well-being.  This IQC contract has a duration of 120 months from the date of award.  The funding source for the base project must be expended by the end of FY 2011, and extension of participant tracking beyond the time envisioned in the base project would require a separate source of support.  Under the base project, each offeror should be alerted to the possibility that participant tracking could be extended to four years from enrollment (2.5 years beyond the tracking schedule for the base project provided for in this RFP). This procurement is unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities) and the size standard is $6.5 million, average for the last three years.  A Time and Materials type contract is expected to be awarded as a result of this solicitation. However, the Government reserves the right to award the most appropriate type of contract. If the contractor awarded this contract is a large business concern, a subcontracting plan is required to be submitted with their proposal.  The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) has established a 45% small business goal for prime contractors.  The solicitation package will be available on or about 15 days form this notification and proposals will be due on or about 45 days from this announcement. Special Announcement: This notice will be posted on HUD's Internet Home Page since HUD posts all required notices of its contracting opportunities at http//www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/Index.cfm.  Potential offerors who download copies of solicitations from HUD's Home Page Contracting Opportunities or FedBizOpps will not automatically receive any amendments to those solicitations.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)  intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source noncompetitive basis to the Ottawa Heart Institute Research Corporation, 40 Ruskin Street, Ontario K1Y 4W7, Canada, for genotyping of DNA samples to study the genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, restenosis.   

Background / Objectives / Scope of Work
The purpose of this project is to acquire information regarding genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, in-stent restenosis.  In the NHLBI DIR initially, and now in the NHGRI DIR, investigations for the CardioGene Study have been undertaken to evaluate the genomics, genetics and proteomics of restenosis. From the genetic analysis, which used a genome-wide scan, we have identified multiple candidate susceptibility loci in a case control population study design.  Further genotyping is necessary for completion of the study.   This will be essential to determine which, if any, identified genetic polymorphisms may confer susceptibility to restenosis.

The CardioGene Study represents an opportunity to investigate the significance of basic findings regarding vascular wound healing in the disease in-stent restenosis.  The lab has previously determined and investigated the significance of key cell cycle regulatory proteins, specifically the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), in regulating the repair of blood vessels following vascular injury.  The lab has found that there are two major processes that occur within blood vessels following the treatment of blockages in coronary arteries with balloon angioplasty and stent placement.  While dilation of the artery and placement of the stent treats the vessel blockage, it also creates a slight wound to the blood vessel. Most individuals respond well to the procedure, but approximately 25% of people treated with bare metallic stents develop a recurrence of the blockage within six months due to a regrowth of cells. This regrowth of cells narrows the artery within the stent and leads to a recurrence of clinical symptoms, called restenosis. The laboratory has defined two processes that lead to restenosis: unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells and inflammation. Additional studies in the laboratory have identified the CKIs, particularly p27kip1, as major regulators of cell proliferation and inflammation.

The basic research was expanded in the CardioGene Study to test these findings in the clinic. It was hypothesized that patients who fail balloon angioplasty and stent placement by developing restenosis have a genetic susceptibility that predisposes then to the disease. It is further hypothesized that these patients have abnormalities of cell cycle signaling pathways which regulate cell cycle signaling and inflammation. To understand the importance of cell cycle signaling pathways in human vascular disease, this clinical study of patients with coronary artery disease and undergoing stent therapy has been done. Approximately 460 patients were enrolled into the CardioGene Study, with 356 enrolled prospectively at the time of stent implantation and 104 cases with a history of restenosis enrolled to enrich the case group. Prospectively enrolled patients were followed for one year and divided into two groups based upon their clinical outcome: restenosis vs. no restenosis. Three sets of analyses are being conducted: (1) gene expression profiling to determine patterns of RNA expression in patients, (2) proteomics to determine patterns of protein expression in serum, and (3) genotyping using a genome-wide scan approach. From the genome wide scan, some candidate genetic loci and genes have been identified. Validation of these findings in independent cohorts of unrelated patients, for a case-control validation association analysis, will be essential for distinguishing false positives that may be obtained from a genome wide scan approach from truly associated polymorphisms that confer risk for restenosis.  Further genotyping on the original CardioGene study sample will provide improved genome coverage as compared to the initial genome wide SNP assay conducted previously.  As discussed below, this acquisition will require genotyping of unrelated patients who have received bare metallic stents and have restenosis outcomes after stenting determined as well as individuals with and without coronary artery disease. The information from these validation studies will be combined with the CardioGene Study to directly benefit patients in determining which patients respond best to stent placement and in developing new targets to treat restenosis. 

The reference number for this notice is NHLBI-PB(HG)-2008-084-KLW.

The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and the resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-23.

Approximately 1,200 genotyping assays are estimated for this requirement.   The period of performance is seven (7) months from the date of award.

The intended procurement will be classified under North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 541380 and the associated small business size standard is $ 6.5 Million. 
 
Through competitive procedures the Ottawa Heart Institute Research Corporation was awarded a purchase order to conduct the initial genotyping of DNA samples to study the genetic susceptibility to the vascular disease, restenosis for the CardioGene Study, protocol #02-H-0102.

In order to maintain the continuity of the methodologies used for the initial genotyping, an award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   


This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The resulting acquisition will be entered into pursuant to the acquisition authority set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.   Responses to this notice will be reviewed in accordance with the following criteria: (1) Understanding of the Requirement and Organizational Experience.  (2) Expertise and Experience of Key Personnel.  (3) Genotyping Method and Throughput.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) is an open source, open access information network connecting the cancer research community and enabling the sharing of data and tools.  Through partnership with the cancer research community, the caBIG initiative will speed the translation of research findings into clinical decision making, treatment, and improved outcomes.  caBIG enables research groups to tap into the rich collection of emerging cancer research data and facilitates the integration of diverse data types while supporting individual investigations.

The NCIs Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (NCI-CBIIT) conducted caBIG as a pilot during 2004-2006.  In view of the pilots success, NCI has launched caBIG on an enterprise-wide basis (caBIG Enterprise).  The needs of this expanding community will be met through the offerings of the caBIG Enterprise Support Network (ESN), presenting new opportunities for cancer and academic medical centers, IT companies, and others to serve as support providers, mentors, and knowledge experts.  Participants in the caBIG ESN will play a vital role in seeing caBIG technology become an everyday part of cancer research and, in the future, an integral component of broader biomedical research and clinical care.  As part of that effort, NCI-CBIIT is implementing the first caBIG Knowledge Centers as a new component of support to facilitate the widespread adoption and integration of caBIG standards, tools and infrastructure by application end users, such as bench scientists, biospecimen managers, pathologists, clinical trialists and information technology administrators.  Two complementary activities will be launched as part of the ESN ? caBIG Service Providers and caBIG Program Offices.  NCI-approved caBIG Service Providers will provide comprehensive technical and end-user support.  caBIG Program Offices will be established at institutions and organizations interested in installing and deploying caBIG tools and infrastructure broadly throughout these entities.  The caBIG Workspaces will continue to identify needs and requirements, set priorities and strategic direction of the Workspaces, which may result in the issuance of competitive RFPs to meet these needs.  Working in close coordination with the NCI, caBIG Program Staff and the caBIG Workspaces, the ESN will provide the infrastructure needed to support the needs of the expanding caBIG community.

caBIG Knowledge Centers will be established at institution(s) with demonstrated expertise in a specific area of focus or domain.  Within these centers, individuals with caBIG domain-specific expertise will be identified to fill specific roles related to caBIG outreach and tool integration.  Domain experts are individuals possessing professional-level knowledge, skills, and abilities in the relevant biomedical discipline with demonstrated experience in applying information technology to solving substantive problems in that biomedical discipline.  Within the bounds of a specific domain, these caBIG-designated Knowledge Centers will possess the expertise required for more complex knowledge transfers, thus enabling the provision of personalized assistance beyond existing applications support and communication materials.  This expertise will also be leveraged by the Knowledge Centers to identify and synthesize shared needs across the stakeholder community in the domain of interest.  In addition, Knowledge Center staff will ensure that these needs and other relevant issues and feedback are communicated to the appropriate caBIG personnel (i.e., Workspace Leads, NCI-CBIIT, and caBIG program staff).

The caBIG Knowledge Centers are expected to serve as the repositories and resources for the knowledge associated within their designated area of focus.  By doing so, the Knowledge Center acts as the steward of the tools and documentation, providing access and support to those individuals and institutions interested in making use of or extending caBIG tools.  Such stewardship takes the form of not only providing access to the current release versions of the tools over which a given Knowledge Center has oversight, but also maintaining access to the current development version of the code via the CVS/SVN systems provided by the NCI-CBIIT.  Such access should also include the possibility of authorized outside groups providing changes and bug fixes to this code, with the Knowledge Center facilitating decision-making about the proposed changes through the Workspaces.

The critical nature of documentation requires the same level of effort for its stewardship by the Knowledge Centers as that for the tools.  The Knowledge Centers shall ensure that documentation is accurate, authoritative, up-to-date, readily available, and adheres to the guidelines of the caBIG Documentation and Training Workspace.

In creating and staffing the Knowledge Centers, partnering with caBIG developers, caBIG adopters, future caBIG Service Providers, caBIG participants, or others who are expert in the domain of focus at other organizations is encouraged.  It is expected that the Knowledge Center will be comprised of at least one full-time Operations Manager responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Knowledge Center.  The individual must have experience working with the caBIG program and possess subject matter expertise.  The Knowledge Center must be overseen by a Knowledge Center Director who is a senior level individual with professional credentials and stature as well as experience with and knowledge of the caBIG program.  The Director is ultimately accountable for the operations, service, and products of the Knowledge Center.  The level of effort required to accomplish the work to be performed for each of these Knowledge Centers is expected to be approximately the equivalent of four full time, senior staff, but recognize that the effort may be distributed among multiple individuals of different levels of experience. Offerors are encouraged to propose allocations of time, numbers of individuals, and allocations of duties among the Knowledge Center staff in order to describe how staff align with the Offerors vision for the Knowledge Center.  While staff may serve needs within their home institution, their primary emphasis will be externally-oriented, reaching out to other institutions and organizations with interest in the specific domain expertise offered by the Knowledge Center.

SAIC-Frederick, Inc., on behalf of the The National Cancer Institute, is seeking professional services to utilize ?Cancer Biomarker Assays for Evaluation of In Vitro Nanoscale Diagnostic Devices.?

The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, has established the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer (http://nano.cancer.gov) to harness the power of nanotechnology to reduce the burden of cancer. Currently, scientists are limited in their ability to turn promising molecular discoveries into benefits for cancer patients. Nanotechnology has the potential of providing the technical power and tools that will enable new approaches in cancer diagnosis, therapy, and prevention.
The goals of the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer are to develop:

Research tools to identify new biological targets
Agents to monitor predictive molecular changes and prevent precancerous cells from becoming malignant
Imaging agents and diagnostics to detect cancer in the earliest, most easily treatable, pre-symptomatic stage
Multi-functional targeted devices to deliver multiple therapeutic agents directly to cancer cells
Systems to provide real-time assessments of therapeutic and surgical efficacy
Novel methods to manage symptoms that reduce quality of life 
The purpose of this solicitation is to identify relevant biological assays applicable to cancer detection in conjunction with the use of existing, non-commercial nanoscale devices or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). These assays will be used to validate the relevance of such devices to clinical applications.

The potential Subcontractor need not have expertise in nanoscale devices or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) development, but must demonstrate (a) the interest and willingness of other research groups possessing knowledge of such technologies to collaborate with the applicant, and (b) the compatibility of the applicant?s assay with the surface chemistry of such device technologies.

Specifically, the potentials Subcontractor shall utilize method and/or reagents for the biochemical or biophysical detection of human cancer markers in laboratory or clinical samples meeting the following criteria:

	1. Cancer detection technologies will rely on molecular assays based on binding events (e.g., nucleic acids, aptamers, antibodies, enzymes) with binding agents being immobilized onto a solid support (e.g., silicon chip, gold nanoparticles).

	2. Assay will be amenable to be implemented into two or more existing, non-commercial nanoscale platforms or microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) (e.g., microcantilevers, gold nanoparticles).

	3. Assay will have a detection limit of 1 pM or better.

	4. Assay will be resistant to biofouling and non-specific binding (in the presence of 100% plasma).

	5. Mechanism of cancer marker detection using the proposed assay is well understood. Furthermore, the assay is relevant to the diagnosis of cancer or the treatment of cancer patients in a clinical setting.

	6. Prior successful demonstration of the assay in at least one embodiment with robust performance under diversified testing conditions is required as a condition for award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The primary purpose of Amendment 01 to BAA 08-15 is to revise the Phase 2 prototype proposer and/or end-user development cost share requirement from a "mandatory" 50% to requiring only that "some" such cost share be made.  Additionally, the BAA is revised to reflect that the amount of the proposed cost share will be taken into consideration as part of the Government's evaluation (See evaluation factor f "Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition").  Finally, Section III "Eligibility Information," is revised to reflect a new paragraph one (1) under "Procurement Integrity, Standards of Conduct, Ethical Considerations, and Organizational Conflicts of Interest." Due dates for abstract and proposal submissions have not changed as a result of this amendment.  A revised/conformed BAA 08-15, dated 15 February 2008, is provided as an attachment to this amendment.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center New Orleans (SPAWARSYSCENNOLA) intends to issue a solicitation limited to educational institutions in the Southeastern Louisiana area  with graduate degree programs related to disciplines described below pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302(a)(2)(iii) for advanced research and development projects. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA intends making a single award. The purpose of this contract is to obtain analytical and technical support services from undergraduate and graduate students and faculty at a geographically local educational institution in support of Advanced Research and Development projects on behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana region.  The solicitation will result in an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for issuing firm fixed priced task orders.   On behalf of multiple customers in the Southeastern Louisiana and South Mississippi region, the winning contractor shall provide analytical and technical support services in the following disciplines:  Electronic, computer engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics  Computer Science and information systems  Mechanical engineering and fluid mechanics  Geospatial characterization  Data fusion  Acoustical communications  Industrial/organizational psychology  Modeling and Simulation Customers include, but are not limited to: SPAWARSYSCENNOLA; Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education Command; Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration; Department of Navy Chief Information Office; National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the National Finance Center. The contract will have a base year and four one year options.  The total estimated value of this contract, if all options are exercised, is estimated to be $50,000,000 using Navy Research and Development funds. FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) states that full and open competition need not be provided for when it is necessary to award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain essential engineering, research or development capabilities by an educational institution.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has determined that such criteria have been satisfied in this acquisition. As the Navy's center for personnel, pay and manpower systems, research, development, test and evaluation, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has a need to establish and maintain a pool (civilian employment and otherwise) of scientists and engineers interested and capable of maintaining systems critical to the Navy and other military customers.  In order to assist in maintaining this pool of capable scientists and engineers, it is essential that future scientists and engineers receive hands-on training and exposure to Navy RDT&E conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA in the disciplines identified above.  It is essential to the Navy, and particularly the activities receiving these services, to maintain a pool of interested and trained engineers and scientists. SPAWARSYSCENNOLA engineers and scientists attest to the impact predecessor contracts have had on the realization of this goal. Many students exposed to these activities via predecessor contracts returned to support these projects or related work either as contractor employees or directly via the SPAWARSYSCENNOLA' New Professional Program. Employing students specifically from academic institutions will address the essential need for innovation in current RDT&E projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA and with its customers.  The SPAWARSYSCENNOLA  recognizes the importance of scientific investigation through the strategic theme of Innovation. Educational institutions are uniquely positioned to assist SPAWARSYSCENNOLA by providing a source of new and innovative ideas borne of scientific investigation in a rigorous, unbiased academic environment. This procurement will assist in maintaining and providing an essential impartiality and currency in science and engineering services that can only be obtained from educational institutions. Theoretical analysis, exploratory studies and experimentation conducted by students of a relatively unbiased educational institution are potentially superior to that of a for-profit corporation, due to the educational institution's interest and dedication to pure research. For-profit corporations focus on direct economic profit-oriented goals, return on investments, and bottom-line profits as opposed to pure unbiased discovery research. The goals of educational institutions include scientific investigation for its own sake, with broad charters focused on learning and discovery of knowledge within a given area. Educational institutions can focus on investigation and learning for knowledge alone, regardless of any return on investment or practical use of the knowledge acquired. This focus, in turn, fosters innovation. It has been the experience of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA that educational institutions are able to support research and development projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA with a continuing infusion of the very latest academic concepts and ideas at a relatively low cost. Because the cost of employing students is relatively low in comparison to scientific staff from for-profit corporations, many budget constrained projects at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA would benefit with the participation of students. In many cases, the use of students is not just a cost effective means of stretching project dollars; rather, it is an essential means of accomplishing the mission because project budgets cannot accommodate more expensive labor costs. It should be noted that as SPAWARSYSCENNOLA projects directly benefit from the infusion of innovation and knowledge from an educational institution, there are other essential benefits from the relationship. In February 2006, the National Academy of Science, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a joint report entitled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm:  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."  The report identified alarming trends in the state of American higher education in science and technology; for example:  In South Korea, 38% of all undergraduates receive their degrees in natural science or engineering.  In France, the figure is 47%; in China, 50%; in Singapore, 67%.  In the United States, the corresponding figure is 15%.  There has been a 20% decline in science and engineering doctorates awarded to US citizens or permanent residents between 1995 and 2004.  Estimates of the number of engineers, computer scientists, and information technology students who obtain 2-, 3-, or 4-year degrees vary. One estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, and information technologists with 4-year degrees, while the United States graduated about 140,000.  China graduated about 290,000 with 3-year degrees in those same fields, while the United States graduated about 85,000 with 2- to 3-year degrees.  Over the past 3 years alone, both China and India have doubled their production of 4-year degrees in engineering while the United States production of engineers is stagnant. Moreover, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA has found that the New Orleans area currently has a shortage of experienced scientific and engineering personnel. This contract action is a counterweight to such trends.  SPAWARSYSCENNOLA materially participates in multiple projects spanning a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines on behalf of numerous civilian and military agencies of the United States government and private industry concerns.  Much of the work conducted at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA is exclusive to SPAWARSYSCENNOLA.  The unique challenges and opportunities associated with scientific investigation at SPAWARSYSCENNOLA are a significant inducement for students to continue their education in science and technology.  As an intentialconsequence, SPAWARSYSCENNOLA seeks to stimulates and maintain the availability of a critical workforce essential to its mission as a Navy's pre-eminent manpower, personnel and pay information technology support center. In sum, the Navy has a strong interest in establishing and maintaining essential basic engineering and research and development capabilities relevant to Navy applications and interests; therefore, competition shall be restricted to educational institutions in the South East Louisiana region in order to maintain the essential engineering, research and development capabilities vital to the accomplishment of SPAWARSYSCENNOLA missions.

Original Notice
The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is contracting on behalf of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for a general contractor for a new laboratory building (B1E) in Boulder, Colorado.     

The B1E will be one of the most technologically advanced buildings in the world.     The laboratory combines the features of close temperature control, vibration isolation, air cleanliness, and demanding power quality into a facility of crucial national importance.       The B1E consists of an L4 High Performance Lab, L5 Instrument Lab and L6 Precision. Temperature control will be achieved down to 0.1 degree C in some areas, humidity control to 5 percent, air filtration to M3.5 (class 100), and vibration control to less than 3 micrometers/second.     At the B1E, electrical substations will be installed to transform site high voltage of 13.2 kV down to 480/277 V. State-of-the-art clean power quality will be required to meet stringent lab requirements and eliminate variables from scientific research. The new facility will provide for the current needs of quantum science research in computing and communications, nanotechnology, improved atomic clock research, high speed electronic measurements, and microfabrication of research devices. 

The proposed B1E gross building area is approximately 137,000 square feet. Environmental and space requirements for the building are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST?s most technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness.     The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1E cannot be economically met with renovated laboratory space; therefore, the B1E is a necessity for NIST?s continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. 

The solicitation will be published on or about December 5, 2007, with an award anticipated for the summer of 2008.     The estimated price range of this project is $50,000,000 to $80,000,000.     Completion time for this project is estimated at nine hundred (900) calendar days after the written Notice to Proceed.     All project requirements and submission information will be available electronically and without charge through Fed Biz Opps on or about December 5, 2007.

Source selection will be made using best value trade off process (FAR 15.101-1).       The government will not pay for any information solicited.     Offers that do not meet all the requirements or are not submitted within the allotted time will not be considered.     

All contractors doing business with the Government are required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and the On-line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).     To register with the CCR and ORCA and become eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun & Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier. A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet at 800-234-3867 or on line at 
https://www.dnb.com and click on ?get a D&B D-U-N-S number?.


This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns.     The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $31 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.     Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities.     In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.     Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).     An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.     Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.     However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Denver/Boulder area) business concern participation.     Please refer to the SBA website for additional details at www.sba.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Closing Date:  05 March 2008.

The Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), Director for the Chief Technical Offices (CTO) in partnership with the Chief Information Officer (CIO)/G6 is conducting market research to identify strategies that leverage industry best practices, and as appropriate, available products, technologies, and services to accomplish the Army?s three enterprise IT goals: to improve the delivery of IT services; increase the security of its information and networks; and reduce the total cost of ownership of its IT Enterprise.  

The Army?s IT performance and security requirements can be compared to global commercial finance, commerce, and health care systems but will need to operate in these environments:  peacetime military engagement, limited intervention, peace operations, irregular warfare, and major combat operations.

Interested sources will provide a white paper describing their recommended strategies.  Responses must be in compliance with all applicable Army, DoD and Federal policies.  For example, storage of DoD data in a foreign owned facility will not be considered.   

Proposed strategies must leverage and not duplicate DISA?s Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES).  If NCES is not considered, rationale is to be provided.

After reviewing the submissions, the Government may afford industry a one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active information exchange dialogue.

Requirement Statement:

The Army is required to provide common IT voice, video, and data services to its user base of approximately 1.3 million users distributed across six regions(PACOM, EUCOM, SOUTHCOM, NORTHCOM, CENTCOM, and AFRICOM), on multiple networks operating on four security levels(sensitive but unclassified, secret, top secret, and coalition).  

The operational requirements in each region are unique and any proposed solution must be flexible while meeting the Army?s three enterprise IT goals.  

The population of each region varies between 50,000 and up to 1.2 million users.  Each region may have many campuses with a varying user base of 50 to 40,000.  The population of each campus is composed of users that always operate in their home campus; road warriors that operate at any of the global campuses; and expeditionary users that could roam from campus to campus or establish a new campus in an austere environment with little to no existing connectivity.

Each user requires the capability to store, access, share and backup data, host and access applications, collaborate within and across communities of interest, obtain user assistance, and print. 

Users need seamless identity management and authentication regardless of location connecting via space based, fixed, and/or wireless infrastructure using Common Access Card [CAC] and Public Key Infrastructure / Public Key Enabling [PKI/PKE].

Users require minimal training, minimal configuration changes and robust access to assistance if required.    

Industry must incorporate the following best business practices and should consider evolving concepts for the following in their responses:
-	Data strategy: how data needs to be classified, cataloged, tagged, accessed, searched and stored using a standard, unified interface and making use of metadata as applicable
-	Collaboration capabilities: defined as the wide range of structures, processes, procedures, and services or tools necessary to enable two or more individuals who are not co-located to use an electronic synchronous or asynchronous environment to communicate, plan, coordinate and make decisions to achieve an objective
-	Capacity planning: ability to anticipate network change, available capacity and provisioning required for data, spectrum and network bandwidth during peacetime military engagement, limited intervention, peace operations, irregular warfare, and major combat operations.
-	Content management and data warehousing: strategy on content staging, content management, data warehousing and business intelligence
-	Virtualization: strategy for virtualization of hardware, software, data and applications and use of virtualized environment for the enterprise  
-	Migration: strategy to migrate users, applications and data from installation to Area Processing Centers in an expedient and efficient manner
-	NetOps: network operations and management strategy, outsourced vs. in-sourced network and system management approach, service desk, advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches or a hybrid strategy, best business practices and strategy to manage desktops and providing enhanced security assurance for the enterprise  

Though not required in the responses for this RFI, the Government would also consider proposed strategies for the following:
-	Voice, Video, and Data integration: strategy on Unified Communications (UC) and Everything over IP (EoIP) networks 
-	Service bundling: what IT services can be bundled and offered to end-user and how applicable performance and unit cost of service bundling can be developed, charge-back mechanism for service use
-	Software as a Service (SaaS): how future data and applications be offered using SaaS construct, enterprise standardization using Service-Oriented Architecture (SoA) and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) concepts
-	Cloud computing: future of cloud computing and how data and applications could be made available from the cloud
-	Performance dashboard and metrics: providing a clear view of IT systems performance and key metrics measurement to enable enterprise strategy to include service level agreements (SLAs)
-	Cross-Domain Solution: what/how innovative solutions can be developed that can work across multiple security domains and in the JIIM (Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational) environment
-	IT value delivery: managing IT as a portfolio (of investment options) and realizing value of IT measured in mission or business goals accomplishments and realigning with investment choices

RFI Purpose and Limitations:

The Government?s intention is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution.  Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry.

<DESC>Modification 02 is issued to provide clarification through questions and answers.

Question 1:  In regard to RFI Question 3.1.2.3 "Is an electronic feed or a portal more technically or cost effective?  Why?", can DISA please clarify what it considers the difference is between an electronic portal and an electronic feed? 

Answer 1:  A portal describes a site that functions as a point of access to view information on the web while an electronic feed describes a direct electronic connection where data is automatically pushed out in a standard format for potential integration with Government management systems.

Question 2:  In regard to RFI Question 3.2.1.5 "How can DoD best meet its security needs for provisioned services with minimal impact to industry competition?", Can DISA please further explain what type of information it is looking for in the response to this question?

Answer 2:  As discussed at the beginning of this section, DoD has a number of security needs (i.e., Personnel with U.S Secret or NATO Secret Clearances, Secure facilities with an approved Facilities Security Clearance, Secure communications, EMI/RFI incident resolution, Certification/accreditation of information systems in accordance with DoD policies and procedures, Tracking, Telemetry, and Control Encryption of command links).  DISA understands that industry vendors meet these needs to varying degrees.  DISA
hopes to understand how it can best structure its procurement mechanisms to help industry maximize its security posture.

Question 3:  Are partial responses acceptable if my firm wants only respond to sections that are applicable to our areas of expertise?

Answer 3:  Submitters must respond to all questions on the RFI, but if your firm has no expertise in an area, respond with "No Expertise".  Do not leave the questions blank or use "NA". 

Question 4:  Regarding the 12 point font size requirement (RFI paragraph 7.0), may responders provide tables and graphics in 8-point Arial or Times New Roman?  For graphics and tables, the smaller font will be more readable and reduce crowding in graphics.

Answer 4:  Government concurs on font size change.

Question 5:  It appears that the "second" Paragraph 3.1.2.3 should be Paragraph 3.1.2.4. Is this correct?

Answer 5:  "Second" paragraph 3.1.2.3 should be paragraph 3.1.2.4.

All else remains the same.

<SUBJECT>99 -- HMMWV Industrial Based Production
<SOLNBR>SPM7L1-08-R-0006
<RESPDATE>042108
<CONTACT>Patty Snyder, Contract Specialist, Phone 614-692-1127, Fax null, Email patty.snyder@dscc.dla.mil
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Columbus is issuing a solicitation in support of HMMWV Industrial Based Production Programs.  This contract is the follow-on to replace the Customer Pay contract, SP0750-06-D-9711, which expires in December 2008.  The awardee will function as a Prime Services Integrator (PSI ) for three separately described but integrated services required to effectively and efficiently support the HMMWV industrial production programs: 1) Technical support to apply best manufacturing and repair practices to any Full or Tailored Implementation Sites, currently Red River Army Depot (RRAD) and Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) which are full implementation sites and Maine Military Authority (MMA) which is a tailored site; 2) Repair parts, components and kits support to accomplish the required repairs and upgrades; and 3) Operation of a dual supply system for replenishing (i.e. ?pushing?) the required parts using proven just-in-time supply practices.  Under the dual supply system each part/NSN provided under this contract will have a primary source assignment- either the Government material is to be used (Gov?t. 1st Source), or the contractors material is to be used (Contractor 1st Source). The dual supply system is activated when parts are not available in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements. At that point the contractor will either obtain parts from DLA (for Contractor first sourced items that they cannot provide) or the contractor must provide their parts for items first source to the Government.  This dual supply system requires the contractor to price every item being supplied under this contract and to have the capability to supply Government first sourced parts with little or no lead time.  The measurable goal of acquiring these parts and services is to produce a better product to the field, faster and at a lower cost.  

The Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1.  It has been determined by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) that AM General LLC, 105 Niles Avenue, South Bend, IN 46617, as the developer and sole manufacturer of the HMMWV, is the only firm with the technical expertise and in-place logistics system necessary to meet the requirements of this solicitation.

This acquisition is for a requirements type contract to include functional support services as well as parts support for any HMMWV part for any HMMWV variant, both current and future.  The initial population of items to be priced is approximately 2000 items in support of the Army industrial based production programs, of which approximately 50% are estimated to be awarded as a first source to the contractor.  Additional parts and implementation sites may be added as needed. The acquisition item descriptions for these approximate 2,000 items included in this initiative will include the NSN/Part Number, nomenclature, and technical data, including quality requirements. This will be provided as an attachment to the solicitation.

The contractor shall provide functional support services for items on the contract. This will include:

(1)	supply of proprietary and non-proprietary items
(2)	management of inventory
(3)	forecasting customer requirements and ?pushing? supplies to the production line
(4)	system engineering and technical support
(5)	synchronize supply distribution to meet depot and operational requirements
(6)	rapid response manufacturing for priority requirements
(7)  kitting of identified items as required
(8)  recommend improvements to maximize production line efficiency


The contractor will store and maintain title to contractor owned inventory until the point of consumption by the customer. The stock will be held at either Government locations or Contractor warehouses near depot production sites, currently at RRAD and LEAD.  As the contractor will maintain ownership of the stock until consumption, the contractor will be responsible for maintaining a discrete level of safety stock suitable to prevent stock outs.  The contractor will have visibility of stock attrition to effectively plan and ramp up and forecast the requirements.  The contractor will also store, manage, and forecast inventory for Government sourced parts, with the Government retaining title to the inventory until point of consumption.  

This procurement will be made on an All or None basis to streamline processes.  This will also help to ensure award is made to a sole qualified contractor with experience and capability providing these parts and to serve as a complete prime system integrator. It is again important to note that the demands supported by this procurement are over and above ?normal? operational requirements.

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years.

Solicitations will be issued upon request.

<DESC>************ PLEASE NOTE:     This is a modification to Space Warfare Center (SWC) Open Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-01.     Call SWC BAA 04-06 makes minor changes to existing focus areas under TENCAP and the Fusion Center.  This call also changes submission instructions, separating instructions for unclassified and classified documents.     Other clerical changes have also been made as a result of this modification.     Calls will be executed on an annual basis.     White papers for SWC BAA 04-06 may be submitted from the date of this announcement through 18 Feb 09.     All terms and conditions of the previous announcement for SWC BAA 04-05 remain valid.     A complete description of SWC BAA 04-06 is identified in the attached document.     The SWC may contract for activities covered in the focus areas detailed within this document.     The intent of the BAA is to investigate and develop concepts and technologies that will enable the SIDC to meet current and future Air Force warfighter space needs.     The goal is to develop technologies that provide the best possible space capabilities for the warfighters, when and where needed, in the most cost-effective manner,.     White papers and subsequent proposals can cover either development of new capabilities for potential 3600 R&D acquisitions or leverage off of existing capabilities for 3400 O&M acquisitions.     Please closely follow the directions in the BAA regarding submission of white papers and do not submit a formal proposal at this time.     After market research was performed, it was determined that specific funds would not be set aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.     However, should potential white papers be accepted from those institutions, and adequate funding become available, proposals will be requested from them.     Direct questions to Mr. Robert Wind at (719) 567-3565 (robert.wind@schriever.af.mil).

<SUBJECT>59--Sources Sought For Fiber Optic Rotary Joint Units With Load Bearing Technology With Integration Capability
<SOLNBR>N6133108QWC01
<RESPDATE>022808
<CONTACT>Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140, or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC-PCD) is seeking sources that may have fiber optic rotary joint with load bearing technologies that may be integrated into a submerged moored system.  The moored system contains a floating sensor suite and data acquisition system that is usually moored with an altitude of less than 50 ft off the ocean floor.   The system will never be deployed in a depth greater than 1000 ft seawater.  Data that is collected by this system is then fed topside for further analysis via a 4 singlemode fiber optic tether.  This fiber tether currently descends the mooring line to the ballast (aka anchor) section and then proceeds along the ocean floor toward topside.  Sources are sought to provide a fiber optic rotary joint at the intersection of the mooring line and ballast section to prevent fouling of the tether and mooring line.  Given the location of the rotary joint, it will also have to endure a safe working load not to excee!  d 4000 lbs.  Descriptive information is sought in the form of brochures, specification sheets, Commercial price lists and/or development costs, and company points of contact. This source sought announcement may not directly lead to a request for proposals. Interested parties should respond to this Sources Sought Announcement by 28 Feb 2008.  Interested parties may send notification of candidate products (hard copy only) to: Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division Mr. Robert Parker, Code A62  110 Vernon Ave. Panama City, FL 32407-7001 Any technical questions regarding this subject may be directed to Mr. Robert Parker, Code A62 at 850-234-4041 or robert.h.parker1@navy.mil. This is not a solicitation. In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest Division (NAVFAC SW) located at 1220 Pacific Highway (Code RAQ1.RC), San Diego, CA 92132 is conducting market research on identifying responsible sources and obtain information to purchasing renewable power at Marine Corps Air Station, Miramar located in San Diego, California. NAICS CODE: 221119   The Navy desires to purchase power generated from renewable power generation technologies or systems, located off-site or adjacent to the base, developed and constructed by a private entity or entities.  The intent of the Navy is to enter into a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for an approximate minimum capacity of 3MW or a minimum of 20,000 Mega-Watt-Hours (MWH) per year, for a period between 15 years to 20 years, without any interest in the ownership of the renewable power technology or system. It is the intent of the Navy to direct private entities to make their own arrangement and coordination with the local regulated utilities to deliver such renewable power to the MCAS Miramar?s main meter or alternatively directly to the base?s grid in order to accommodate the Navy?s PPA.  It is also the Navy?s desire to purchase power using a  rate which provides a Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) equal to or lower than the unit cost for electric power delivered to MCAS Miramar.  Retention of the Renewable Energy Credit (REC) as well as the future ability to separate the carbon credits is required. Additionally, under the Center for Resource Solutions (CRS) Green-e products (U.S Green Building Rating Systems EA-6 credit), be defined as renewable. Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) is the governmental agency that?s currently procuring non-renewable power for the Navy and is the Navy?s power scheduling coordinator.  Specifically, the Navy is interest in identifying risks associated with awarding the above PPA for MCAS Miramar.  Perceived risks are construction timelines, power transportation and delivery coordination, cost impact of departure load and standby load charges, Renewable Energy Credit (REC) sales and pricing and capital financing availability.  Responses to this RFI should address these and other issues that the responder feels should be brought to the attention of the Navy. The followings are anticipated events and timelines: a)	Award PPA contract in 12 months b)	Renewable power delivery no later than Nine (9)  months after contract award THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND A CONTRACT AWARD WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE ATTACHED QUESTIONAIRE.

<DESC>The VA Upstate NY Network (VISN 2) facility at Buffalo, NY intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for the development and implementation of a valet parking system, including all staff, materials, and labor, at the facility. Sources are being solicited to identify any potential vendor capable of performing this work who holds the necessary technical competencies and evidence of an acceptable past performance record.  Potential offerors must be established companies with a verifiable record of recent past performance of valet services at large, urban facilities experiencing parking congestion.   Potential offerors will be required to visit the facility to provide offers in response to any RFP released as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Potential offerors will be required to prepare a full analysis and breakdown of their proposed valet parking plan, based on current space restrictions at the facility and proposed Government-provided valet parking spaces.  This proposal/plan will be part of the evaluation factors for any RFP released as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  There are an estimated 125 parking spaces that will be set aside for contracted valet services, though this number is subject to change before or during solicitation. Potential offerors must be able to perform the services described herein at the VA Western New York Healthcare System Hospital, 3495 Bailey Ave., Buffalo NY.  The potential offeror does not have to be based in the Buffalo area, but will need to be able to provide local staff with which they have experience, attend meetings and site visits on short notice, and respond in-person to inquiries or requests by the Contracting Officer.   Potential offerors must be capable of performing their own background investigations, including but not limited to inquiries of employee driving records, drug screenings, criminal record checks, and employment history.  Government background investigations may also be administered. Contractor will be required to provide all materials necessary for provision of services outlined in their proposed valet parking plan.

The Government will include language in this contract that holds the contractor responsible for any loss of personal property or damage to vehicles or facilities as a result of performance under this contract. In addition to parking staff, potential offerors will be required to provide supervisory personnel that are located at the VA Hospital on a daily basis to oversee operations and respond to any concerns/requests of the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.   If at least two responsible sources are identified that fulfill the same socio-economic category, the Contracting Officer may set this solicitation aside.  If no responses are received, or there is no level of response adequate to justify a socio-economic set-aside, the Contracting Officer may release this solicitation to the open market. Under the provisions of PL 109-461, if only one Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Business or Veteran Owned Small Business concern is determined responsible and offers reasonable pricing, the Contracting Officer may set this work aside to negotiate a sole-source award.  Multiple SDVOSB or VOSB responses deemed able to perform this work may result in a competitive set-aside.   For more information on this matter, please contact the contracting officer, Jason V. White, at 716-862-6004.   This solicitation is anticipated to be released within thirty days of the close of this notice.

<SUBJECT>99 -- PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO THE COMMITTEE''S PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  

Items being considered are: 1) Batteries (6135-00-826-4798; 6135-00-900-2139; 6135-00-985-7845; 6135-00-985-7846; and 6135-00-835-7210).  2) Four-Ply Cut End Mopheads (7920-00-NIB-0430; 7920-00-NIB-0431; 7920-00-NIB-0432; 7920-00-NIB-0434; and 7920-00-NIB-0435).  3) Dual Head Stethoscope (6515-00-NIB-0115).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 
For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.  Reply by November 11, 2002.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA)
<DESC>The Department of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to issue, on behalf of the DOE Strategic Center for Natural Gas and Oil, a Funding Opportunity Announcement entitled "Environmental and Unconventional Oil  Technology Solutions to Oil and Gas Resource Development." The overall objective of this activity is to initiate Research and Development (R&D) to address a broad spectrum of environmental and Exploration and Production (E&P) issues associated with unconventional resource development including, but not limited to, those indentified from the 2007 Oil Shale Environmental Issues and Research Needs Workshop.  Issues related to unconventional oil and enhance oil recovery (EOR) include those associated with the Bakken Shale and like resource plays, the Arctic North Slope and other resources/areas with significant environmental and/or technological barriers. It is anticipated that the following Topic Areas will be addressed through this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA): Topic Area 1  Environmental R&D The scope of work related to this area will address the constraints to development of domestic natural gas and oil resources, the top priorities identified in the 2007 Oil Shale EnvironmentalWorkshop, and the environmental issues that impact access to Alaskas energy resources. Area 1.1  Produced Water and Other Natural Gas and Oil Environmental Issues Applications are sought to develop lower-cost produced water treatment and/or handling technologies, such as down-hole separation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Seeks
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) 
Collaborators for 
NAFLD, NASH & Cryptogenic Cirrhosis Clinical Trials

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks Industry collaborators for Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to provide novel therapeutic agents, diagnostic markers and devices for use in NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trials and studies in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis. 

BACKGROUND:
The NAFLD Database study - A prospective database of adult and pediatric cases of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or cryptogenic cirrhosis was created by the NIDDK-funded NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN), which has accrued over 1,500 adults and pediatric subjects over the past 3 years.  In addition to the NAFLD Database study, the NASH CRN has developed two treatment trials: (1) PIVENS: to evaluate whether 96 weeks of treatment with either pioglitazone or vitamin E lowers NASH activity as determined from hepatic histology in nondiabetic adults with NASH compared to treatment with placebo, (2) TONIC: to determine whether 96 weeks of treatment with either metformin or vitamin E leads to sustained reduction in serum alanine aminotransferase in nondiabetic children with NAFLD compared to treatment with placebo. PIVENS and TONIC have completed recruitment and these studies are expected to be completed in 2009.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease present a variety of opportunities for CRADAs.

STUDY GOALS:
The overall goal of the NASH Clinical Research Network sponsored by the NIDDK is to focus on the etiology, contributing factors, natural history, complications, and therapy of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.  The NASH CRN studies currently comprise a large and well characterized population of individuals with various stages of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis.  

The NASH CRN is interested in conducting research that will lead to improved clinical outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cryptogenic cirrhosis patients with industry collaborators to:  
-	Evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, epigenomics, imaging studies, and determinants of progression and severity of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and/or NASH as well as clinical trials to assess optimal treatment of adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD, NASH and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Develop serum/plasma proteomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, microbiomic and expression arrays that are diagnostic of fatty liver disease or NASH or cryptogenic cirrhosis and that would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, steatosis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease. 
-	Explore use of serum markers for fibrosis and serum markers for disease activity to predict hepatic histology either by themselves or in combination with other clinical, laboratory, proteomic, metabolomic, and lipidomic variables in the NAFLD Database study. 
-	Explore the utility of these serum markers as surrogate markers of therapeutic response in study subjects participating in adult (PIVENS) and pediatric (TONIC) treatment trials.
-	Evaluate a panel of serological assays that reflect hepatic fibrosis, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress to differentiate among NAFLD, NASH, or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Investigate proprietary drugs, reagents, or devices in controlled randomized clinical trials as potential therapy for NASH, NAFLD and/or cryptogenic cirrhosis in children and/or adults.  
-	Evaluate noninvasive imaging methods for assessing fat, inflammation, disease activity and/or fibrosis in NAFLD/NASH including but not limited to the use of elastrography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and molecular imaging.
-	Identify protein alterations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), or cryptogenic cirrhosis.
-	Evaluate the role of lipid peroxidation in the pathogenesis of NASH or NAFLD and analysis of the effect of various therapies on the levels of serum peroxides in patients with NASH or NAFLD participating in treatment trials. 
-	Evaluate the use of cytokine assays for analyses of serum/plasma cytokine levels as markers of necroinflammatory or fibrotic activity in NAFLD or NASH and as surrogate markers of histologic improvement in therapeutic trials of NAFLD or NASH.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Preventative Maintenance and Extended Warranty for Gilson Inc. Laboratory Instruments
<DESC>This is not a solicitation and thus quotes are neither requested nor required.  This is a special notice of intent.  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) requires preventative maintenance and service and an extended warranty to ensure timely maintenance and repairs or replacement of a variety of laboratory instruments and equipment previously purchased from the manufacturer Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI.  A complete list of the instruments and equipment covered by the preventative maintenance agreement and extended warranty is provided as an attachment to this synopsis.

CDC intends to purchase the preventative maintenance service and extended warranties from Gilson Inc. which is the only known, responsible source capable of satisfying the minimum requirements.  No other source is capable of maintaining and servicing the laboratory  instruments and equipment because Gilson Inc. is the sole, exclusive distributor of Gilson Inc. products in the United States.  Additionally, any alterations or modifications to the equipment or instruments by non-Gilson personnel will void the manufacturer's warranty. A maintenance agreement is necessary to ensure that service is received in a timely manner when repairs are needed and to ensure that preventative maintenance is performed on the instruments to prevent  problems and ensure uninterrupted performance.

A contract for a Basic one-year period of performance plus four, one-year options is contemplated.

The statutory authority for this intended sole source procurement action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 29, 2008. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Respondents must detail their qualifications to perform the required preventative maintenance and repair services as well as explain how they will provide a manufacturer's warranty for each instrument and equipment identified on the attached list.  Respondents must also explain how their services will not void the manufacturer's warranty and identify any such services and warranties for similar Gilson, Inc. equipment provided during the previous three years from the date of this synopsis. Identify the name of the business or government agency and contract or purchase order number for which such services and warranties are provided.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responses shall be submitted via email to Mr. Lionel Nadeau at: lnadeau@cdc.gov

<SUBJECT>V -- Metrochecks for Transit Subsidy Program
<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval. The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF), intends to negotiate sole-source procurement with Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority through the SmartBenefit? Program, fare media, and the SmartTrip? fare cards. The Government intends to award for a base period of one year and four option years.

Mission:  The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is an independent foreign assistance agency of the United States government, working to promote equitable, responsive, and participatory self-help development in Latin America and the Caribbean. According to Part IV, Section 401(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, "it shall be the purpose of the Foundation, primarily in cooperation with private regional, and international organizations, to: Strengthen the bonds of friendship and understanding among the peoples of this hemisphere; Support self-help efforts designed to enlarge the opportunities for individual development; Stimulate and assist effective and ever wider participation of the people in the development process; Encourage the establishment and growth of democratic institutions, private and governmental,
appropriate to the requirements of the individual sovereign nations of this hemisphere."
IAF Background:  The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) is an independent agency of the United States government that provides grants to nongovernmental and community-based organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean for innovative, sustainable, and participatory self-help programs. The IAF primarily funds partnerships among grassroots and nonprofit organizations, businesses and local governments, directed at improving the quality of life of poor people and strengthening participation, accountability, and democratic practices. To contribute to a better understanding of the development process, the IAF also shares its experiences and the lessons it has learned. The guiding principles of the Inter-American Foundation are to support people, organizations, and processes; channel funds directly to the non-governmental sector; promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and self-reliance; strengthen democratic principles; empower poor people to solve their own problems; and treat partners with respect and dignity.
Nature and Description of Action:  The Inter-American Foundation requires fare media through the SmartBenefit? program and SmartTrip? fare cards for the public rail transportation service in the DC metro area including Maryland and Virginia communities. 
A sole source to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority is intended for this order. No other known rail sources have access to the SmartBenefit? program fare media and fare cards.
No solicitation document is available. The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than ten days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Other Information:  Electronic submissions, in response to this Notice, shall reference SS-08-0013 and be sent to the attention of Susan Barker and e-mailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov. Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00 PM ET, Friday, February 29, 2008. Please note that an RFQ document is not available at this time.

STATEMENT OF WORK: 

Business Objects (Webi) is a software tool chosen by FDA for reporting requirements related to emergencies, outbreaks, workplanning/load projects, trends, and analysis of FDA regulated industries.

BACKGROUND 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a need to enable end users to use reporting software tools to develop their own data mining reports in order to rapidly and effectively respond not only to outbreaks or emergencies involving FDA regulated products, but also to develop reports that reflect the agency's statutory workload obligations through the current trending and analysis of data. 

OBJECTIVE

Business Objects (Webi) is the reporting software tool that is used by FDA. In order for customers to be able to use the software, they must be trained:

a.  Many users have been using a previous tool and need training to teach them how to use Business Objects (Webi).

b. With over 4000 users, there is an ongoing need to provide training to the user community.

c.  The Office of Regulatory Affairs Reporting, Analysis, and Decision Support System (ORADSS) recently migrated from Version 6.5 to XiR2. This version change has caused Business Objects (Webi) to function and look differently. Both the novice and technical (expert) staff require training.

The plan for FDA is to have a total of 5 classroom courses delivered by September 30, 2008 nationwide.  Each classroom course is a total length of 2 days.

Over all course objectives: 
a. Explain current Business Objects concepts and terminology 

b. Log in to Business Objects and refresh predefined reports and rename them

f. Use tables, crosstabs, and charts to view data in different ways 

g. Create reports and build and run simple queries to retrieve a additional information from a single data provider

h. Access the FDA/ORA universes and navigate throughout these universes

h. Create/develop a report specific for the user's organization(e.g. district, laboratory, region, Division, etc.), using various universes, such as Collection, OEI, and Inspection universes 

PROGRAM PLANNING

During the training, the contractor will provide FDA subject matter experts with a high degree of technical knowledge who can advise, facilitate and assist in a) clarification and identification of roles and responsibilities, b) identification and analysis of resources, c) development of process, procedures and arrangements.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Anticipated award date is no later than 1 March 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 29 February 2008.  PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION.  Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Tracey Burgess at 252-335-6790.  Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

STATEMENT OF WORK
1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
1.1 Introduction.
1.2 Objective. The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain the
equipment and services necessary to expand and install the Air Force Institute of
Technology's (AFIT) Physical Access Control System (PACS) into building (Bldg) 641.
The capability to expand and install the PACS into Bldg 641 is not available within AFIT
or the 88ABW. Through this SOW AFIT desires to contract the purchase of the PACS
system equipment and the equipment installation to expand the PACS into building 641.
AFIT's PACS is a crucial mission support system for the security and safety of AFIT
personnel, facilities, and equipment; it secures all of AFIT's facilities and equipment in
all of the main campus' five buildings. The Air Force has initiated new requirements
under Homeland Security Presidential Directive- 12 (HSPD- 12) for access control
systems that standardizes these types of systems Air Force-wide. The expansion of
AFIT's existing system will comply with the current Air Force standardization effort and
be compatible with planned future requirements under HSPD-12.
1.3 Scope. The PACS provides physical security for all AFIT facilities. The system
secures the external entry doors into all AFIT buildings on the main campus, office suites
and individual offices, internal entrances into laboratories, and entrances to classified
work areas. The PACS in Bldg 641 will control access to four exterior doors and 35
internal doors. The contractor will be responsible for expanding the existing PACS into
Bldg 641 and seamlessly integrating the new portion of the system into the existing
system. The contractor shall provide labor, materials, supplies, and equipment in
