<DESC>NASA/ARC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the OperationallyResponsive Space (ORS) Office to procure the Rapid Response Space Works and Modular SpaceVehicles (RRSW/MVS).This pre-solicitation notice is issued to replace the Request for Information SynopsisRapid Response Space Works-Formerly Known as Chile Works" Reference number NNA09ORS001Lposted July 17, 2009, which will be archived on October 23, 2009. The tentative RRSW/MSV schedule is:  Issuance of Draft RFP  October 16, 2009; Industry Day  Oct 27, 2009;  Comments on Draft Document Due  Nov 9, 2009;  Finalsolicitation  Nov 23, 2009;  Proposals Due  45 days following issuance of final RFP; Contract award  March 2010----Industry day will be held at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Moreinformation will be posted at a later date.----Schedule and other information about major upcoming ARC procurement actions is availableat http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eis/admin/admin.cgi?center=ARC    Overall Scope of Requirements: The Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW) and Modular Space Vehicle (MSV) procurement has twoprimary objectives. The first objective is to standup initial operations of the RRSW.This objective creates the ability for the ORS Office to meet its Deploy missioncapability of rapidly deploying capabilities to the warfighter within days to weeks. Thesecond objective is to procure, outside of the RRSW, modular multi-mission space vehiclesand/or buses and payloads for the RRSW. The first planned procurement under the MSV awardis a task order for a modular Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite (SARSat). In closecooperation and coordination with the RRSW and ORS Office, modular spacecraft will bedesigned, integrated, tested, launched, and will be controlled and operated to meet theRRSW responsive concept. The architecture developed for these responsive, modularspacecraft will be designed in such a way as to allow flexibility to meet multiplemissions with minimal changes within the basic design. The spacecraft architecture willinclude a multi-mission, modular bus design and multi-mission, modular payload designs(mission kits will include electro-optical (EO) and radio frequency (RF) payloads). ----The work will be performed at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. ----NASA/ARC is planning a solicitation with multiple contracts to be awarded. One award fora single IDIQ contract for the stand-up and initial operations of the RRSW and a multipleaward IDIQ for modular space vehicles, buses, and payloads. We anticipate the RRSW awardwould be a 5 year IDIQ contract that consists of a 3 year base with two one-year options.Additionally, we anticipate awarding multiple five-year Modular Space Vehicle IDIQcontracts to the most qualified contractors capable of providing the modular spacevehicles, buses and modular payloads to meet the ORS mission set. Both of these effortsare planned to be International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) restricted and operateat least at a DoD Secret level. The individual task orders on the multiple IDIQ contractswill specify the mission requirement, whether the call is for a space vehicle, or just apayload or bus, and will establish the period of performance. Contractor Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Plans will be evaluated in theirability to mitigate interactions and potential conflicts between RRSW and MSV contracts. The NAICS Code is 541712  Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, andLife Sciences (except Biotechnology) with Size Standard: 1000 employees, under theexception of Space Vehicles and Guided Missiles, their Propulsion Units, their PropulsionUnits Parts, and their Auxiliary Equipment and Parts----An ombudsman has been appointed.

<p>This synopsis for translation services listed below is being submitted in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the upcoming solicitation for this service. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections is seeking a contractor to provide services to translate selected portions-including text and tables-of the English version of the Occupational Outlook Handbook into Standard Latin American Spanish. The Bureau also requires an English-to-Spanish translation of an article from the summer 2009 Occupational Outlook Quarterly, including text, tables, and charts. The objective is to disseminate career information in Spanish that is intelligible to a diverse Spanish-speaking audience, while accurately reflecting the syntax, writing style, and factual information in the English version of the corresponding OOH chapters, or "statements," and the summer 2009 OOQ article. Because the translated documents will be read by a diverse Spanish-speaking U.S. audience, the final product must avoid a final translation with a strong national or regional flavor.</p>
<p>Occupational Outlook Handbook: The OOH is published in December of every other odd year; the 2010-11 edition will be published on the Bureau's public web site in December 2009. The Bureau wishes to have a translated version of a subset of occupational statements, available on the web site by December 2010. Based on an analysis of the Bureau's web usage statistics, the EP program has selected 100 occupational statements for translation in FY 2010 The contract length will be for one base year 09/28/2009 -09/27/2010 and 1 option year, 09/28/2010-09/27/2011. The solicitation will be posted on August 28, 2009. For further inquiry, please contact Joan Gantt, gantt.joan@bls.gov</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS WITH A VALID GROUP 70, SIN 132-51, GSA FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE.  THIS IS ONLY A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requires services to assist in the continued work on the Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) and its related components.  This requirement focuses on the quality land and survey records, and the digital depiction of those records, including the Public Land Survey System and Cadastral related information and boundaries.  Cadastral is defined as the rights, interests and characteristics of real property and their geographic extent.   The primary BLM source for this information is the BLM source land records and survey documents, the Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB).  Work will encompass records collection/maintenance, digital data collection, maintenance, error detection, accuracy improvement, file and format conversion, standardization, data integration, and product generation covering all BLM National, State, and Field Offices.
The first component of this requirement assists the BLM in establishing, analyzing, and maintaining a standard data set depicting a cadastral data framework including the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and scanning survey records documents.  This cadastral framework data set is needed to support the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) as well as provide the basis for mapping BLM and other federal land records data.  The Western Governors Association has endorsed BLMs Geographic Coordinate Data Base as the best source of PLSS data for establishing the standard data set across the Western United States.  This work includes the geospatial services, from collection through the analysis and abstraction of cadastral survey records/data with mathematical adjustments, mapping, and on-the-ground measurement of corner positions.  
The second component of this requirement supports the collection, maintenance, and publication of BLMs official Land Status records and automated case abstracts (e.g., LR2000), the recording and depiction of boundaries, and the scanning of documents.  This will include but is not limited to the land records data housed in BLMs LR2000 data base and other information describing other parcels and boundaries. Examples of other parcel and boundary data include special use areas, land in the National Lands Conservation System, restrictions or use stipulations etc. 
The BLM anticipates awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to the offeror whose RFQ package provides the best value to the Government.  BPA calls will then be placed against the BPA as BLM requirements are identified.  The estimated period of performance is December 2009 - November 2010, with four, one year option periods.  
The standard NAICS classification is 541370.  Size standard is $4.5 million.  Much more detail will be provided when the Request for Quotation (RFQ) is posted on GSA eBuy.  The RFQ will be posted on or around October 26, 2009.  This presolicitation serves to give notice to the public that the requirement is forthcoming.
Questions regarding this announcement should be addressed to Chad Hepp, BLM Contracting Officer, at Chad_Hepp@blm.gov or 303-236-0901.

The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for the photography and merchandise sales operations at Hoover Dam, Nevada.  The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price, performance-based service contract for a base and four (4) option years.  Hoover Dam is located approximately 7 miles northeast of Boulder City, Nevada and 32 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada.  Photography and Merchandise Sales are authorized under the Miscellaneous Sales Act, Public Law 106-461.  Reclamation is authorized to sell memorabilia, products, and publications that will enhance the public's visits to Hoover Dam and/or provide information and educational data regarding the Dam and the fish, wildlife, and environment of the areas surrounding the dam.  The contractor will display and promote merchandise and sell souvenir photographs.  Reclamation manages all of the engineering, maintenance, and public activities that directly involve Hoover Dam.  Hoover Dam is perhaps the most historically important dam structure in the United States.  It sits across the Colorado River (Nevada/Arizona boundary) and forms Lake Mead.  The dam which was built during the depression and completed in 1935 provides power generation, downstream flood protection, and water for agricultural and human consumption.  Over 1,000,000 people per year make a specific effort to visit Hoover Dam either on their way through or as a specific side trip.  Reclamation operates a large visitor center and also provides a multi-story parking structure, both on the Nevada side of the dam.  Visitor services are conducted every day, excluding Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, with spring and summer receiving the highest visitation.  There are retail outlets, run by the State of Nevada under the authority of the Randolph Shepard Act, providing souvenirs, food, and beverages to the public.  A new bypass with a bridge across the Colorado River is currently being constructed below the dam and when it is completed in 2 or 3 years, it will provide for the through traffic and change the current traffic and congestion crossing the dam.  
The Performance Work Statement (PWS) of the solicitation will require the contractor to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to manage and operate the photography and merchandise sales operations seven days a week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas days.  The contractor will be required to manage and operate an integrated on-site portrait photography and merchandise sales operation for Hoover Dam visitors.  Overall management and administration would be expected to assure that all operations run efficiently and provide good value and service to the public by one company.  The contractor would be expected to enhance the historic Hoover Dam experience while maintaining the dignity of the area.  The work will include the following principal features of work, including but not limited to:  (1)  Accept, display, sell and account for merchandise sales; (2) Take professional digital photographs of tourists, process photographs and place in an attractive folder, and sell on-site or via the Internet; (3) Account for photography sales; (4) Provide financial and managerial controls to carry out all of the tasks related to photography and merchandise sales; including maintaining a record of the number of photographs sold, merchandise sold, method of payment, price paid, and accounting for all revenue received based on fees collected; and (5) Managerial personnel must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, and possess good customer relation skills.

<DESC>The United States Postal Service intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract for Advanced Metering and Controls for an Energy Management System. The purpose of this RFP is to invite qualified suppliers of energy monitoring and metering systems to provide their “Energy Management System” (EMS) solution to the USPS meeting our requirements outlined within the solicitation.   For the purposes of this solicitation, the EMS is defined in general, as the “monitoring of power consumption (advanced metering/submetering) and the monitoring, and controlling of the environmental parameters associated with a building HVAC system.”  To be considered, each supplier is to submit a Management Plan/Technical Factors and a price proposal.  The project is estimated from today’s data that total costs will range between $7.5 million per year and $22.5 million over three years. The primary goal is to obtain a level of functionality within the installed system such that the building’s energy vital signs, primarily HVAC performance and electrical, water, and gas consumption, can be monitored by the USPS from a remote location via the USPS’s Enterprise Energy Management System (EEMS).  Communication will utilize the USPS intranet.  The specific application shall provide monitoring/control capability for the USPS Medium Standard Building Design (MSBD) facilities that typically range from 10,000 to 60,000 square feet.   These systems utilize roof top units or heat pumps for heating and cooling.  The proposed system must utilize open architecture and allow interactive control across the network through direct communication with the field panel.  No computers or software outside the Supplier’s equipment are to be required at the site.  As USPS standards call for BACnet protocol compliance, the Supplier’s ability to comply with BACnet protocols and integration with the USPS’s EEMS is essential.  The communication link between the USPS’s offsite EEMS and the Supplier’s EMS shall be considered compliant if the Supplier’s BACnet hardware/software has been certified by the BACnet Testing Labs (BTL).  Systems that utilize non-certified BACnet protocol will be considered, although as a reduced value.  By selecting devices built on the USPS standard protocol, BACnet, USPS is working toward nationwide standardization and integration of all building systems under one management tool.  All installations will be at broadband internet enabled offices, so monitoring and control must be compatible with the USPS WAN/LAN.  In all situations, connectivity shall follow the rules and security standards of the USPS Corporate IT.   The communication protocol within the Supplier’s system (I/O between devices) shall be either BACnet or MODbus.  Wireless communications are not required but will be considered.  Subcontracting goals for this project are: 35.8% Small Business Enterprise, 3.60% for Minority Business Enterprise, and 5.80% for Woman Owned Business Enterprise.  All questions concerning this solicitation shall only be directed in writing in WORD format to Michael Bacha at michael.j.bacha@usps.gov.  Questions shall be clear, concise, numbered and dated.  Do not attempt to contact anyone else during this process as only answers issued from Michael Bacha will be included in Amendment(s) issued.  A pre-proposal conference will be held at Tuesday October 20, 2009; Time: 10:00 AM; Location: 4301 Wilson Blvd, Conference Room C3, Arlington, VA  22203.  Proposals are due on November 6, 2009 at 3:00pm EST and should be hand delivered or mailed (using one of the fine services offered by the Postal Service) to the attention of Michael Bacha, SMFP, Suite 300, 4301 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22203-1840.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NHLBI-HB-11-02 will be available on or about October 23, 2009.  The solicitation will be for the Data Coordinating Center for the program entitled “Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study – III (REDS-III)”.  It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years.  

The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE DATA COORDINATING CENTER ONLY.

The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.

The domestic hubs and the international programs shall be supported by a DCC which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory which shall be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological, and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) shall compile donation and patient data from the domestic centers (i.e., hubs) in 1) a centralized cumulative donor/donation/component database; 2) a centralized cumulative patient database; and 3) a centralized cumulative linked donor-recipient database that shall link all information on donors and their donations/components to information on the patients who received these components. The hub Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC) shall provide to the DCC the links that shall allow for the data from the donors, their donations and components to be linked with data on the recipients who received them.  It will be desirable that at least 20,000 RBC transfusion exposures occur per year at each hub’s participating hospitals/outpatient clinics.  It would also be desirable, although not required, that the consortium of hospitals participating in the hub admitted the following minimum number of cross-matched adult patients each year at the following hospital services: 1) intensive care units: 1,000; 2) cardiac surgery, 1,000;  3) orthopedic surgery,  500; 4) oncology/cancer center, 1,000; and  5) trauma service, 1,000.  Each hub’s blood center must collect at least 75,000 allogeneic blood donations per year.  Analysis of all data compiled in the databases shall be conducted by the DCC.  Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated five large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about ten laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] during the course of the domestic program. 

The DCC shall compile donor and donation data from each international site in a centralized cumulative donor/donation database and shall be responsible for providing all statistical/analytical support for the analysis of these data. The blood centers participating in each international program must collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually. Analysis of all data compiled in the database shall be conducted by the DCC. Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated three large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about three laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] conducted at each of the REDS-III international collaborative programs. 

The DCC shall perform the following study requirements: 1) coordinate REDS-III activities and participate as a member of the Oversight and Steering Committees to develop and implement a coordinated plan to achieve program objectives; 2) develop and maintain operating procedures for the REDS-III program; 3) develop and maintain a public and private REDS-III website; 4) develop and finalize the protocols and associated Manuals of Operations for the cumulative centralized databases; 5) coordinate and participate in the development and finalization of REDS-III study protocols and develop corresponding Manuals of Operations;  6) provide all necessary data management and tracking systems; 7) track all REDS-III biospecimens  and their associated data, and identify biospecimens for retrieval; 8) provide training sessions and conduct site visits, as appropriate; 9) provide biostatistical support during protocol development and analyze database and study data collected during REDS-III; 10) assist the Oversight Committee and Steering Committees in preparation of scientific reports for publication and presentation; 11) help coordinate and convene the REDS-III Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB),  provide administrative and logistic support for OSMB meetings/calls, prepare and present data reports to the OSMB, and prepare minutes of the sessions; 12) coordinate and convene the REDS-III External Review Panel,  assist the NHLBI COTR(s) with the selection and invitation of the External Review Panel, provide administrative and logistic support for the External Review Panel meetings, prepare minutes from External Panel  sessions and coordinate and pay for External Review Panel members travel and honorarium; 13) prepare quarterly and annual technical reports;  14) interact with the COTR(s) on programmatic research activity issues; 15) At close-out of the study, or earlier as directed by the COTR(s), create public use data sets for each data collection activity with documentation; and 16) ensure an orderly transition of REDS-III resources to a successor contractor at contract expiration. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is soliciting proposals on a full and open competitive basis for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA).  The purpose of the SAMHDA is to provide access to substance abuse and mental health data in order to increase the use of data for understanding and assessing substance abuse and mental health problems, as well as the impact of related treatment systems.  SAMHDA is the sole point of distribution for the public-use files for the majority of SAMHSA’s Office of Applied Studies (OAS) surveys, namely the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), and the Treatment Episode Admissions and Discharge Data Sets (TEDS).  In addition, SAMHDA houses other data from SAMHSA and other key substance use and mental health studies, such as Monitoring the Future (MTF) and the baseline National Co-Morbidity Survey (NCS-1).  The data are currently distributed both as data files and through online table-generating software.  All datasets are processed to ensure consistent display and documentation properties.

The contractor will be required to: (1) host, maintain and expand a web-based archive of datasets pertaining to substance use and mental health; (2) make these data and documentation available through statistically valid online data analysis tools, downloads and other methods; (3) use statistical expertise to (a) process all incoming datasets, and (b) conduct disclosure analyses on non public-use datasets to determine disclosure risks.  Based on the results of the disclosure risk analysis, the contractor will be required to implement statistical disclosure limitation (SDL) measures in the creation of public use files; (4) create dissemination and outreach materials and resources, represent the archive at relevant conferences, and provide technical assistance to users; (5) make restricted-use data available through a restricted-use data analysis system that implements data file-specific disclosure limitation methods to individual datasets as analyses are conducted; (6) make confidential restricted-use data available through a data portal that will house confidential restricted-use data; and (7) allow approved researchers access to these data from their off-site locations.  The estimated period of performance is 60 months, with an anticipated start date of February 1, 2010.  

This solicitation may be obtained in any of three (3) ways: by mail; picked up in person at 1 Choke Cherry Road, Room 7-1051, Rockville, MD 20857; or, through FedBizOpps.

Total available funding for proposals received under this topic: Up to $1,050,000 maximum.

Pre-proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions set forth in the existing BAA which can be viewed at http://www.mvk.usace.army.mil/contract/docs/BAA.pdf. <BR><BR>Proposals received as a result of this announcement will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria specified in the BAA through a peer or scientific review process. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement and to make award without discussions. To the maximum extent practicable, any contract(s) awarded using Recovery funds will be awarded as fixed price contracts. The number of awards made will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds as identified above. Offerors of Pre-proposals receiving favorable initial review will be encouraged to submit a more detailed Full proposal.<BR><BR>FAC 2005-032 was issued on 31 Mar 09 and amends the FAR to implement the provisions of the Recovery Act.

The revisions include new FAR provisions and clauses and cover the following subjects: Buy American Requirements, Whistleblower Protections, Publicizing contract Actions, Reporting Requirements, and GAO/IG access. FAC 2005-32 also implements Section 871 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2009 (NDAA) with respect to GAO access to contract employees.  FAC 2005-32 is published in the Federal Register at 74 FR 14622 <BR><BR>It is anticipated that additional requirements (i.e., contract clauses, reporting requirements, etc.) may be added to the BAA and/or contract awards that will be applicable to projects funded under the Recovery Act.

As a result, no additional funds will be available to supplement the Recovery Act funding. <BR><BR>Any proposals submitted as a result of this announcement shall be submitted electronically with Recovery in the subject of the email and on the cover page of the proposal and with the Topic number/Title identified.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In October 2008, USTDA approved funding for the Turkey: Energy Diversification and Efficiency Assessment Mission (Activity No. 2008-81002A), to review Turkey&rsquo;s overall energy balance, evaluate a range of options to meet domestic electricity needs, recommend a strategy to diversify the types and sources of fuels used in energy production, recommend methods to improve overall energy efficiency, and identify policy reforms that would encourage more private sector investment in the Turkish energy sector.<span>&nbsp; </span>An additional objective of the Assessment Mission was to recommend further relevant USTDA activities, of which the study for which proposals are now solicited is one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Substantial reserves of lignite exist throughout Turkey.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of its generally low calorific value, most of this lignite is used in electric power plants.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the possibility of gasifying these lignite resources to produce pipeline-quality gas has a significant potential to increase Turkey&rsquo;s energy self-sufficiency and reduce its vulnerability to natural gas import shocks.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sample tests have indicated that gasification of Turkish lignite is possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>The study will help determine the technical and economic feasibility of proceeding with lignite gasification on a commercial scale.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Project&rsquo;s eventual location will depend on site, fuel, and climate information, though the Grantee has mentioned the Afsin-Elbistan site in central Turkey as a potential plant location.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The Grantee produces about half of the lignite mined in Turkey and ranks as the third largest lignite producer in Europe.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other half is produced by Elektrik Uretim A.&#350;. (E&#368;A&#350;), a state-owned electricity generating company, which burns lignite in some of its plants.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Grantee was established in 1987 and has mined only lignite since 1993.<span>&nbsp; </span>As of March 2008, it had $1 billion in revenue with approximately 12,000 employees.<span>&nbsp; </span>It operates eight large mining operations, both open pit and underground, and remains government-owned due to the policy that primary energy sources should be in public hands.</span></p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - Soft-shore Erosion Control and Soil Bioengineering at Marine City, MI
<SOLNBR>RFI-CBP-SBI-091009
<RESPDATE>101609
<CONTACT>William Mallison, Contract Specialist, Email william.f.mallison@dhs.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI):
Soft-shore Erosion Control and Soil Bioengineering Solution at 
Algonac State Park, Marine City, Michigan

The U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP), Secure Border Initiative (SBI) requests information about possible solutions for soft-shore erosion control and soil bioengineering along an approximately 1,000-foot stretch of shoreline at Algonac State Park (located at 8732 River Road, Marine City, MI 48039).

1. Background:
Achieving control of United States borders is a key mission of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The U.S. Customs & Border Protection, Secure Border Initiative is a comprehensive, multi-year plan to achieve this key mission, prevent terrorism and eliminate illegal immigration. In April 2007, Congress directed CBP to begin addressing vulnerabilities on the U.S.-Canada border. The current objective of the SBI Northern Border Project is to design, install, and deploy surveillance technology capabilities in the Detroit and Buffalo Border Patrol Sectors. 

The project includes installation of 16 Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) sites, which include a combination of existing structures and monopole towers. There will be 11 RVSS sites in the Detroit Sector along the St. Clair River.  One of these monopole RVSS sites is located near the shoreline at Algonac State Park.  (Please see attached aerial photographs for more exact location information.)

There is currently an existing erosion barrier along approximately 200 feet of the shoreline is this area; it a series of connected gabion baskets containing rocks.  (Please see attached photograph of existing gabion erosion barrier.)  CBP-SBI and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) seek an expanded soft-shore erosion control solution to fortify the shore near the RVSS tower.

Algonac State Park is a public space, and parties who respond to this RFI are encouraged to visit the site and examine the location.

2. Requested Information:
CBP-SBI requests possible soft-shore erosion control solutions (hereafter referred to as soft-shore solutions).  “Soft engineering” is the use of ecological principles and practices to reduce erosion and achieve the stabilization and safety of shorelines and the area surrounding rivers, while enhancing habitat and improving aesthetics.  Soft engineering is achieved by using vegetation and other materials to soften the land-water interface, thereby improving ecological features without compromising the engineered integrity of the shoreline or river edges.

CBP-SBI and MDNR seek the expertise of accomplished marine construction contractors and erosion control experts.  Parties who respond to this RFI are encouraged; if they deem it appropriate, to provide multiple solutions or options.  If more than one option is proposed, they should be clearly delineated (Example: Option A; Option B; etc.).  

Parties responding to this RFI are especially encouraged to evaluate the soil bioengineering techniques outlined in the U.S. Department of Agriculture publication, A Soil Bioengineering Guide for Streambank and Lakeshore Stabilization (please see the attached document.)  

Please provide an ESTIMATED price for the proposed solution.  If multiple options are proposed, please provide an ESTIMATED price for each option.  This information will be used for market research purposes by CBP-SBI.

We anticipate a solution that will extend along the shoreline approximately 500 feet north and 500 feet south of the RVSS monopole tower location, for a total length of approximately 1,000 feet.  This area includes the existing approximately 200-foot long gabion basket erosion barrier.  Parties who respond to this RFI are encouraged to visit the site in order to assess the location of this existing erosion barrier; possible approaches may include incorporating the existing barrier into a new solution, removing it, replacing it, or pursuing  some other approach.  We are seeking an efficient, practical, and reasonable solution.

CBP-SBI and MDNR are NOT interested in erosion control solution(s) which include the following: bulkheads; groins; metal or concrete seawalls; pilings; dredging; discarded construction materials; or any approach that would be characterized as hard shore erosion control engineering.

All proposed solutions will be reviewed by MDNR and the CBP-SBI Northern Border Project Program Office.  All proposed solutions shall adhere to all applicable laws, regulations, codes, and rules, including those of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.  MDNR and CBP-SBI expect that parties responding to this RFI will be familiar with these relevant laws, regulations, codes, and rules.

Any proposed solution(s) should include provisions for temporarily blocking off the affected area near the shoreline from traffic to ensure safety, and for performing adequate cleanup after the soft shore erosion barrier has been completed.  Cleanup may include turf or surface restoration.  Parties responding to this RFI are encouraged to consider the best practices relating to safety, sustainability, and cleanup outlined in A Soil Bioengineering Guide for Streambank and Lakeshore Stabilization.

We anticipate that any solicitation for proposals that may be issued in the future, related to this RFI, will be made on a fixed-price basis.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that DHS S&amp;T will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission the Chemical Biological Division (CBD) seeks technologies to prevent and defend against a chemical and biological attack. In addition, the division is charged with pursuing research to improve response and restoration, conduct threat risk assessments, and invest in bioforensics research and development. The focus of this BAA is in the area of bioforensics research.
<p>The threat of terrorist or criminal use of pathogenic organisms and their toxins remains of great concern in the United States. There are vulnerabilities and needs to perform microbial forensic analyses for attribution purposes in a rigorous scientific manner. As part of the effort to deter biological terrorism and strengthen the law enforcement response to such an act, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 10, "Biodefense for the 21st Century" established a dedicated central microbial forensic laboratory known as the National Bioforensics Analysis Center (NBFAC), as part of the Department of Homeland Security to provide bioforensics analysis of evidence associated with the event. The NBFAC operates in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the lead investigative agency in acts of terrorism. This BAA seeks research in the following technical focus areas (TFAs) to support the missions of the NBFAC and FBI for evidentiary analysis and interpretation of results to support a criminal investigation. The ultimate goal of this joint mission is the capture, indictment, and prosecution of the perpetrator(s) of the biocrime or terrorist attack.</p>
<p>The NBFAC has instituted a robust, operational molecular biology program with enhanced capabilities to conduct genomic analysis of biological threat agents. The Bioforensics Research and Development Program supports NBFAC operational threat agent identification and characterization through research investments in basic microbial research and next generation technologies to include molecular biology and genotyping techniques and assays to better understand the origin, evolutionary history, production method and dissemination mechanism associated with the malicious use of biological agents. Pursuant to this mission the Bioforensics Program seeks technologies to achieve the following goals:<br />&bull; Develop novel techniques to culture fastidious bacterial threat agents (BTAs) from complex environmental samples<br />&bull; Develop methods to improve dry collection and extraction of forensic samples<br />&bull; Determine the maturity of ultra-high throughput next generation sequencing technologies in finding rare variants in forensic bacterial samples<br />&bull; Determine the dynamics of mobile elements in bacterial select agents<br />&bull; Develop forensic genotyping methods for select agent viruses<br />&bull; Develop novel applications of orthogonal methods to genetic characterization of BTA signatures and their sample matrices</p>

<DESC>The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify sources capable of performing Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental documentation services at the former Oakland Army Base (OARB), located at Oakland, California.<BR><BR>The 1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended that the Oakland Army Base (OARB) be closed.  In September 1999, OARB was officially closed for military purposes.  The Army transferred the majority of the real property associated with the former OARB to the Oakland Base Reuse Authority via an economic development conveyance in 2003.  The remaining action in the disposal of the OARB property is addressing pesticide contamination at the wetlands on the Union Pacific Railroad property, which is part of Operable Unit 2 (OU2).   <BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delineated the wetlands in a report dated September 1999, and the wetland is 0.34 acres.  The wetland is considered isolated and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Army activities have contaminated the wetland with pesticides (the specific chemical of concern is dieldrin).  In 2001, the Army excavated 945 cubic yards of pesticide contaminated soil from the wetland, and installed three monitoring wells.  Based on the results of groundwater sampling, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is concerned that groundwater on UP property does not meet ecological standards.  The Remediation Goal (RG) to prevent leaching to groundwater is 0.002 mg/kg to protect marine ecological receptors.  However, there is a Technical Memorandum that has been drafted that recommends a RG of 0.07 mg/kg to protect freshwater receptors.  The Army issued a 'Draft Final Closure Report for Operable Unit 2 Wetland Soil Removal' in September 2004.<BR><BR>The contractor will not perform munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or chemical warfare materiel (CWM) work; however, the contractor should be familiar with and be able to recognize MEC/CWM and then notify the Army of potential condition.<BR><BR>The contractor will be responsible for fully executing the following:<BR><BR>1.  Address of any and all unforeseen environmental, scheduling, and regulatory issues.<BR>2.  Perform a supplemental Feasibility Study (FS) and risk assessment for OU2.<BR>3.  Investigation and recommendation of a final remedy for OU2 and development of an Army and regulator-approved RAP/ROD for OU2.<BR><BR>The period of performance effort is 1 year with 4 option years from date of contract award.<BR><BR>Interested sources may electronically submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) not more than five pages long to the point of contact detailed below.  The SOC shall include the following: firms name and address, business size, and names of two principles to contact including title, telephone number, and email address.   It is essential and critical that any prospective awardees be responsible and responsive.  SOC shall address the firms ability to meet the above requirements, experience in providing similar services, management capabilities, former Government contracts, and any other information deemed pertinent to supporting the contractors ability to perform the above services.  The Government is only conducting market research.  THIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  There is no solicitation available.  No cost data should be submitted.  The Government will not pay for any material provided in response to this sources sought notice.<BR><BR>RESPONSE DATE: All responses to this announcement must be received by COB 16 Oct 2009.  Interested parties shall contact the Government POC for any additional questions.  The POC is Angela Hook, Contract Specialist.  Email your SOC and any questions to Angela.Hook@us.army.mil.  POC may be reached via telephone at 309-782-2334.

<DESC>Avian predation on migrating juvenile salmonids, particularly by gulls, is a common occurrence downstream of Columbia River Basin hydropower projects.  Juvenile fish passing dams may become disoriented due to a number of factors (acceleration, change in pressure, etc.), making them vulnerable to avian predation subsequent to passage.<BR><BR>Avian Predation Deterrent Arrays (APDA) have been shown to significantly reduce gull predation on juvenile salmonids below dams.  The proposed John Day Lock and Dam APDA is designed to provide a passive physical deterrent (wire coverage) effect over the entire tailrace area, from the face of the project downstream to the boat restricted zone (BRZ).  This coverage is intended to give disoriented juvenile salmonids time to recover before they move downstream.  <BR><BR>The array support structures (anchor poles) will be anchored on the Oregon shore and navigation lock guidewall, with an anticipated pole height of 90 ft.  Carrier lines will be installed between the anchor poles to provide intermediate anchor points for the avian lines.  Anchor pole and foundation design work will be required as part of the solicitation.<BR><BR>The typical span for a single wire will be approximately 2800 ft, while the longest span will approach 3100 ft.  Minimizing line height is an important component of an effective APDA design.  The avian lines will drape across the BRZ within 40 ft above normal high tailwater (providing minimal sag), with 20 ft above normal high tailwater being the minimum allowable line height.<BR><BR>This will require in-water work with construction starting no earlier than 1 December 2009 and work completion no later than 15 March 2010.<BR>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no more than 45 days after the RFI’s posting in FedBizOpps. Responses received more than 45 days after the RFI’s posting in FedBizOpps may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place following the 45 days posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

<DESC>The Bridger-Teton National Forest is planning to have the Gunsite Pass Bridge constructed in the summer of 2010.  The forest would like to hold a site visit for the project with prospective contractors before snow blankets the ground this fall.  This special notice and site visit does not guarantee that a contract award will be made.    

This project consists of replacing an existing multispan timber bridge across the Gros Ventre River with a new 16' wide, single-lane, 140' long, 2-span, pre-cast/pre-stressed concrete bulb tee girder bridge with weathering steel railing and cast-in-place abutments and wingwalls.  The foundation system will consist of steel pipe piles with concrete caps.  The new bridge will be constructed just upstream of the existing bridge.  Some roadway realignment will be necessary to line up with the new bridge approaches.  The approaches and bridge will be paved.  The existing bridge will remain in service during construction.  An existing telephone cable will need to be relocated and placed on the new bridge.  The timber stringers from the existing bridge will be salvaged and stored at the Goosewing Guard Station located approximately 1-mile from the project site.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement to utilize unique facilities and experienced personnel to provide the VA with expertise to provide alternative ways to measure access to primary care and demand for outpatient services.	It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.   Inquires/information received after established deadline of October 19, 2009 3pm EST shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.  Identification of the (1) agency and the (2) contracting activity: (1) Department of Veterans Affairs, Boston Healthcare System(2) Sponsored Programs Administration      Senior Sponsored Research Administrator      Harvard Medical School      25 Shattuck Street - Suite 509      Boston, MA 02115      Tel: 617-432-2663      2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:The nature of the action is a sole source solicitation to the Health Care Policy Department at Harvard Medical School.  3.  The description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value):The Health Care Policy (HCP)  Department at Harvard Medical School will provide the team with expertise on alternative ways to measure access to primary care and demand for outpatient services which will help test the research hypotheses linking provider-patient continuity to lower demand for services and lower primary care wait times.  As well, the HCP analyst will provide consultation on which physician practice characteristics maximize physician efficiency and quality.  Period of performance is 1 January, 2010 - 30 September, 2010.4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:FAR 6.302-1, 41 USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source5.  Demonstration of the contractors unique qualifications:HCP analysts have published the seminal findings on the relationship between previously uninsured adults who gain access to Medicare and health care utilization and health outcomes.  This research directly supports the stated hypothesis in the proposed research questions and by VA managers that improved access (e.g. better insurance, provider-patient continuity of care) will lead to a lower demand for health care services and lower waits for health care.  Similarly, HCP analysts have an extensive research agenda examining physician practice characteristics and quality measurement.  This expertise is essential to the proposed research because certain practice characteristics are hypothesized to maximize physician efficiency and quality.  6.  Description of efforts made to ensure notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:This requirement is expected to exceed $25, 000 and in accordance with FAR 5.201(b)(1) a notice will be posted through FBO.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:The proposed price for a researcher with this level of education, expertise, and related experience is fair and reasonable.  8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:A review of other researchers has demonstrated there are no other sources available that possess the knowledge of physician efficiency, physician quality, alternative measures of primary care access, quality of care and demand for outpatient services.  9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, or engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available:Requirements for research endeavors are very specific in nature and frequently there is only one responsible source. There is little the agency could do to open this requirement to competition.10.  A listing of the sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:None to date.11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:This contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible. This requirement will be posted to Fed biz Ops in accordance with FAR part 5. POC:   Robert O'Leary, Contract SpecialistFax:      774-826-3003e-Mail: Robert.O'leary@va.govPost on FBO 	Friday October 9, 2009 Deadline:       Monday October 19, 2009 3pm EST

<DESC>Limited Source Justification and Approvalfor Other than Full and Open CompetitionforDepartment of Veterans AffairsRecords Center & Vault (RC&VPBX Trunk Line Telephone Service for RC&VFAR 8.405-61.	Contracting Agency  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1)).  The contracting agency for this purchase is:Department of Veterans AffairsRecords Center & Vault (RC&V)11693 Lime Kiln DriveNeosho, MO  64850	Contracting Activity.  The contracting activity for this purchase is:Department of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation - Austin1615 Woodward StreetAustin, Texas  787722.	Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)).This Limited Source Justification and Approval sets forth the facts and requests approval for contracting by other than full and open competition because the maintenance item is peculiar to one service provider, hence the issuance of a Limited Source Requirement with AT&T Mobility, LLC, 7229 Parkway Drive, Hanover, MD, 21076-1317, 410-782-2801.  The term of this contract will be for twelve (12) months at a cost of $575.00 per month for a total of $6,900.00 for continued coverage/renewal of the contract.  3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs (including estimated value) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)).  AT&T Mobility, LLC provides phone coverage to the Records Center and Vault (RC&V) in Neosho, MO.  RC&V is a subterranean facility so multiple wireless vendors are not an option to allow the VA.  AT&T Mobility's GSA contract number is:  GS-35F-0297K4.	Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)) - Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.The statutory authority for this justification is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) FAR 8.405-6(b)(2) - 8.405-6  Limited sources justification and approval.  (b) Circumstances that may justify restriction cited in paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection include- (1) Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work; (2) The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures; (3) An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above (FAR6.303-2(a)(5)).(Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.)  Full and open competition is not possible because AT&T Mobility is the only vendor who can provide service to RC&V's subterranean facility in the geographical area of Neosho, MO.6.	Description of Efforts To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From As Many Potential Sources As Practicable, Including Public Notice Requirements (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).(A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.)  AT&T Mobility, LLC is a GSA contract holder.  The synopsis pursuant to FAR 5.201 will be not be published in the FedBizOps because the task order is below the $25,000 threshold.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable cost (FAR 6.303-2(a)(7)).  (A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.)  Firm-fixed prices are GSA FSS prices per user and are considered fair and reasonable because they have been previously competed by GSA.  8.	Market Survey (FAR 6.303-2(a)8)).  (A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.)  AT&T Mobility is the only source capable of responding due to the unique and specialized geographic area of RC&V.  9.	Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition  (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9)).  (9) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:(i) Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.(iii) When 6.302-2 is cited, data, estimated cost, or other rationale as to the extent and nature of the harm to the Government.)  None10.	List of Sources, If Any, That Expressed A Written Interest In The Acquisition (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).  (A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.) None11.	Actions, If Any, That Are Being Taken to Remove and Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisitions for The Supplies or Services Required (FAR 6.303-2(a)(11)).  (A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.)VA will continue to perform a market survey to make sure that VA is not limited to just one manufacturer in the future.12.  Technical Requirements Personnel Certification (FAR 6.303-2 (b):I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief./s/ Cynde Bays		10/9/09Cynde BaysBusiness Manager		Date12.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION
<p>This solicitation is for translation services listed below and is being submitted in accordance with the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections is seeking a contractor to provide services to translate selected portions-including text and tables-of the English version of the Occupational Outlook Handbook into Standard Latin American Spanish. The Bureau also requires an English-to-Spanish translation of an article from the summer 2009 Occupational Outlook Quarterly, including text, tables, and charts. The objective is to disseminate career information in Spanish that is intelligible to a diverse Spanish-speaking audience, while accurately reflecting the syntax, writing style, and factual information in the English version of the corresponding OOH chapters, or "statements," and the summer 2009 OOQ article. Because the translated documents will be read by a diverse Spanish-speaking U.S. audience, the final product must avoid a final translation with a strong national or regional flavor. Occupational Outlook Handbook: The OOH is published in December of every other odd year; the 2010-11 edition will be published on the Bureau's public web site in December 2009. The Bureau wishes to have a translated version of a subset of occupational statements, available on the web site by December 2010. Based on an analysis of the Bureau's web usage statistics, the EP program has selected 100 occupational statements for translation in FY 2010 The contract length will be for one year 09/25/2009 -09/24/2010. If your company is interested in this solicitation, <strong>please submit proposal on</strong> <strong>or before 09/15/2009 at 3:00PM ET</strong>. Questions should be submitted to Joan Gant at email gantt.joan@bls.gov and must be received no later than September 3, 2009 at 3:00PM ET.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What type of device are you looking for?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For Personal Alarming Detectors.&nbsp; Radiation detectors with little integration time, readout in exposure rate units or counts per minute, and can fit easily on a belt.</p>
<p>Q. Active or passive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Passive device</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are you looking for an electronic dosimeter or standard (film or TLD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither.&nbsp; It must be electronic but not read out in units of dose such as Sieverts or rem.</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Pricing is based off of each customers volumes, so I will need a quantity range.</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>10-100.</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are trying to understand the need for gamma &amp; X ray in the same device can you explain.</p>
<p>A. &nbsp;Low energy x-rays could signify the presence of other materials.&nbsp; These instruments serve a search function as well as a health and safety function.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You state "passive" but "electronic". By passive do you mean not requiring any user input? As in automatic?</p>
<p>A.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Passive meaning that information does not require active interrogation of an area.&nbsp; Meaning - it works like a metal detector that sits and waits for a signal.&nbsp; It does not pump anything into the air, send out electronic signals, or do anything else to alter the environment to get a reading.</p>

GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project. This project intends to address the requirements to create a high performing energy efficient facility. The intent is to renovate an existing deteriorating federal facility in the building inventory and in doing so modernize the facility into an economically and operationally efficient High-Performance Green Building (HPGB) that is a highly leasable office facility that agencies will be excited to occupy, and do this following principles of Design Excellence and Sustainable Design. Interested parties are encouraged to register through FBO using the "Add Me to the Interested Vendors" link on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. Vendors are also encouraged to register to receive notices about this announcement by using the "Watch This Opportunity" link on the FBO website. NOTE: GSA PBS Region 10 will NOT be maintaining a manual list of interested vendors.
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The project is modernization project in which the Design-Build (D/B) Contractor and its Team shall design and construct renovations and improvements to modernize the existing Jackson Federal Building into an economically and operationally efficient high-performance green building. This modernization project will include replacement and upgrades to building systems (electrical, HVAC, windows, and lighting). LEED-EB Gold certification will be pursued by the D/B Team, with LEED-EB Silver being an alternate certification level if LEED-EB Gold cannot be reached. The specific activities, tasks, and deliverables required of the D/B Team will be further delineated in the Statement of Work during Phase Two of this two-phase D/B solicitation.</p>
<p>The Design Build project shall include the performance of architectural/engineering services based on an approved concept selected during the Request for Proposal (RFP) stage of the acquisition process. The design will be in accordance with GSA quality standards. As required by the ARRA legislation, the facility will be designed to be a high performing green building (HPGB) and as such will meet the most current federal energy goals.</p>
<p>PROJECT SCOPE: This project includes the modernization of the building through a strategy of structure and materials reuse to the greatest practicable extent, introduction of modern building systems and use of innovative technologies to meet HPGB strategies. The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional architectural, engineering, interior design, HPGB consulting service, and related consulting services for concept design documents, design development documents, metric and English construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, space planning, value engineering services, LEED-AP services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD). The project shall comply with GSA design standards.</p>
<p>PROJECT MAGNITUDE: The maximum Estimated Cost of Construction is between $30,000,000.00 and $50,000,000.00.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: 30 - 36 months (Design and Construction)</p>
<p>MARKET RESEARCH: A survey was conducted with industry to assist in the development of the Acquisition Plan for this project. Following are the results:<br /><br />Delivery Method: Design Build is the most appropriate acquisition approach<br />Contract Type: Preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort.<br />Design Competition: Recommendation to limit the design competition (Phase 2) to no more than 5 offerors. <br />Stipend: A stipend would help defray costs to participate in the Design Competition.<br />Award Fee: Preference for good partnering<br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted<br />This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The Design Build contractor will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures and FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will then be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. The short list will not be published in FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>CONTRACT AWARD: GSA PBS R10 contemplates awarding a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) type contract provided all waivers, deviations, and approvals are authorized prior to issuance of the Phase Two solicitation. Failure to obtain the necessary GMP type contract approvals will result in solicitation for and awarding a Firm Fixed Price Contract. The Phase Two RFP will identify which pricing methodology will be awarded, and will contain special provisions and clauses as necessary.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION ISSUE DATE: The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about 09/21/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fbo.gov/.<br />CLOSING DATE: The closing date for receipt of Phase I submittals shall be specified in the RFQ but is estimated to be 10/21/09.</p>
<p>This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for 2009. THERE IS REASONABLE CERTAINTY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE. All reporting requirements from the Contractor are mandated per the Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.

26 March 2009 RFI: 

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) Office of Contract Operations in support of the Cutter Boat Over-The-Horizon Project Office as a means of conducting market research regarding the state of the market for two (Large and Medium) cutter boat designs. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Unsolicited Proposal, or as an obligation or intent by the USCG to acquire any products and/or services. The USCG does not intend to award a contract as a result of this RFI or otherwise pay for the requested information. The purpose of this RFI is to collect available market information that will be used to assist the USCG in evaluating its options related to its urgent need for cutter boat capability.

This RFI seeks principal cutter boat design particulars and operational features on vessels that are or are not currently in operation and have the potential to meet USCG requirements. Furthermore, these vessels shall meet the USCG requirements with or without significant development (e.g. integrate with parent cutter design). Information submitted must be based on: 1) proven currently in-service vessels that are capable of being built in the United States (US); 2) service vessels that are capable of being licensed for building in the US; or, 3) building a variant of the vessel capable of being licensed in the US. New and unproven (not in service) designs are of interest in this request and will be reviewed. The Cutter boats’ missions will generally occur in both littoral (coastal) and deep water (beyond 50 nautical miles from shore) and performing the following missions: Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Drug Interdiction (DRUG), Alien Migrant Interdiction Operations (AMIO), Living Marine Resources (LMR), Defense Readiness (DR) and Other Law Enforcement (OLE). When deployed, operations will generally take place 12 nautical miles or more beyond U.S. shores. However, the parent cutter shall transit and operate for limited periods of time throughout inland defined harbors, canals, or waterways navigable by seagoing vessels. Recognizing that proven designs may not meet all the desired requirements listed in section I of the below listed requirements or that proven designs could possibly be modified to meet the requirements listed below, proven designs within or near the range of characteristics identified in section I of the below listed requirements may be submitted for consideration. The information requested is intended to include, but not be limited to, engineering and operational design details, boat developmental history, operational history, user contacts and other information that would be helpful for making programmatic decisions. Specifically, the requested minimum and desired information is listed in section II of the below listed requirements. Any restrictive markings included on the data shall be clearly marked. In responding to this request, data and information (drawings, documents, tables, graphs, etc.) may be submitted in different formats and media (paper or electronic files). Costs associated with returning information shall be incurred by the provider of such information. Industry is advised that Government’s support contractors (D & P, Whitney, Bradley & Brown Inc, DGIT, ARL, CACI, Analytical Research, EIS and BIG) will be involved with the review of submitted information. If a Government support contractor other than those listed above will be involved with the review of submitted information, each vendor that has responded to this RFI will be notified before their information is provided to the support contractor for review. All Government support contractors required to review the information will be required to submit non-disclosure or confidentiality statements. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG understands that any pricing information submitted under this RFI is an estimate only and is not binding nor constitute a proposal. Responses to this RFI can be submitted to Mrs. Linda Dearing via email (linda.b.dearing@uscg.mil) or hard copy mail no later than 31 March 2009. Responses received after 31 March 2009 may not be afforded a comprehensive review. Responses shall state if interested in design for the CB-OTH-MK V, CB-OTH-MK IV or both cutter boats, the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. 

NOTE: Industrial Day will take place approximately 45 days following the posting of this RFI, the date has yet to be determined for Industrial Day.
