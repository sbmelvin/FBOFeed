<CONTACT>Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, Email pfranzel@nsf.gov
<DESC>The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is performing market research to determine potential sources for planned depot level maintenance (PDM), Ski System PDM and unscheduled drop-in depot level repair/ maintenance (UDLM), for 10 ski-equipped LC-130 aircraft. NSF is the U.S. Government Agency responsible for managing the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), the US national program in Antarctica, including logistic support activities. Responses to this RFI will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.
<p>The U.S. Air National Guard's 109th Air Wing (AW) out of Scotia, New York supplies all medium and long range intra-continental airlift support for the USAP using the Lockheed LC-130 transport aircraft. The 10 LC aircraft are comprised of four NSF aircraft and six 109th AW aircraft operated and maintained by the Department of Defense for logistical support to the NSF in accordance with Presidential Memorandum 6646. These aircraft are Air Force configured. As such, they must be maintained per U.S. Air Force (USAF) standards and technical orders at USAF recognized/authorized depot-level repair facilities. During most years, the contractor will perform two PDMs plus the UDLM work. The UDLM work generally occurs during the USAP's operating season from October through February with the PDMs generally occurring during the austral winter.</p>
<p>Christchurch, New Zealand is the USAP's forward logistics and staging base from which all USAP LC-130 flights to the Antarctic continent originate. In order to maximize aircraft availability in the Antarctic theater, NSF requires ready access to UDLM facilities (see "Place of Performance"). Demonstrated proficiency in the maintenance and repair of the LC-130 airframe and the LC-130's unique ski system is required. Companies interested in performing this work must be Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, and USAF approved for work on LC-130 aircraft. The FAA/USAF certification and approval are prerequisites to a USAP maintenance and repair contract.</p>
<p>Any interested firm should submit a written capability statement to include their experience in the maintenance and repair of LC-130 aircraft and/or LC-130 ski system. Vendors may express interest in a single part or any combination of the three parts of the work. Please do not submit any proprietary information in your capability statement.</p>
<p>Due to the limited time available for this market research, no questions concerning the potential requirement will be accepted.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall not exceed 15 pages in Microsoft Word 2003 and must be submitted to Pamela Franzel, Contracting Officer, pfranzel@nsf.gov, via e-mail, no later than May 23, 2011 by 1600 EDT. Only electronic submissions via email will be accepted; oral responses, hardcopy responses, and electronic responses provided on physical media are not acceptable.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>If and when a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizops.gov. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FBO for release of any solicitation or synopsis.<br /><br /><strong>Place of Performance:<br /></strong>Place of performance for unscheduled drop-in depot level repair maintenance is a facility located in, or in close proximity to, Christchurch International Airport, Christchurch, New Zealand as a matter of practicality and turn-around time.<br /><br />The current place of performance for LC-130 PDM and LC-130 Ski System PDM is Christchurch International Airport, Christchurch, New Zealand; however, PDM at this location is not required.</p>
