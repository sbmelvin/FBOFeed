PURCHASE HISTORY: 	18 APR 2014 - SPRTA114D00090001 28 APR 2009 - SPM40001D9405UN01 23 JAN 2009 - SPRTA109G00010016
QUALIFIED SOURCE(S):	United Technologies Corporation CAGE 52661 			MB Aerospace East Granby, LTD   CAGE 00270 		 	 In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Kevin Howe 405-734-8108, kevin.howe.1@us.af.mil.

QUALIFIED SOURCE(S):	United Technologies Corporation CAGE 52661 			 		 	 In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Kevin Howe 405-734-8108, kevin.howe.1@us.af.mil.

<DESC>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts regular, comprehensive scientific trawl surveys of marine fish and invertebrate populations in the Aleutian Islands, Gulf of Alaska, and the Eastern Bering Sea using chartered commercial fishing vessels. The established survey design is to conduct stock assessment surveys of groundfish on the continental slope of the eastern Bering Sea (even years: 2018, 2020, and 2022) alternating with stock assessment surveys of continental slope and shelf groundfish surveys in the Gulf of Alaska (odd years: 2019 and 2021). The AFSC Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering (RACE) Division Groundfish Assessment Program conducts these comprehensive trawl surveys and related research in the Alaska Exclusive Economic Zone as required to monitor and quantitatively describe trends in abundance and distribution of commercially and ecologically valuable groundfish populations.<br />The baseline work for the groundfish trawl surveys consists of a series of standardized bottom trawl operations conducted at pre-determined, randomly assigned stations as provided to the vessel captain prior to the survey. The Gulf of Alaska survey operations typically span 75 days and will be conducted from late May to early August where approximately 280 tows will be conducted . In even years (2018 and 2020), this vessel will be used separately to conduct the Eastern Bering Sea upper continental slope bottom trawl survey, completing approximately 200 tows over about a 55-60 day period from late May to late July or early August. The bottom trawl survey areas comprise stations at depths that range from 10 m up to 1,200 m (6-660 fm) requiring the vessel to have split trawl winches with a minimum of 1,829 m (1000 fm) of 26 mm or 1 in diameter steel core trawl cable in good condition and available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) but a preference for vessels having 2,195 m (1,200 fm) or more of 26 mm or 1 in diameter steel core trawl cable or more available for fishing on each drum (not total capacity) to ensure complete coverage of the deeper sites in the bottom trawl survey areas.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, intends to award a sole source contract to Ledios Innovations Corporation for PMA 281- Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) requirement. The PMA-281 requires contractor provided services to support the Domestic and Foreign Military Sales programs for Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S), Naval Mission Planning System (NavMPS), Digital Camera Receiving Station (DCRS) and Naval Strike Warfare Planning Center programs. This contractor provided support includes system installations and system Integrated Lifecycle Support (ILS). The ILS consists of the following Logistic Elements: Engineering; Maintenance Planning; Packaging, Handling, Storage &amp; Transportation; Technical Data and Training. This action is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10.U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The anticipated period of performance is 60 days base period. Ledios has been successfully providing the required services under previous contract N68335-16-C-0328, since its inception, and is the only known company with capability of immediately providing personnel with the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities that will ensure there in no degradation or delay in providing integrated logistics Support to NAWCAD. The contract with Ledios is the only means by which to ensure there will be no impact to current and ongoing PMA-281 efforts.

All responses from interested parties shall be made in writing by 19 January 2019 via e-mail, U.S mail, or facsimile to the attention of May Dimitrov, may.dimitrov@navy.mil using the contact information provided in this synopsis.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The T&amp;G PMO is seeking information on how interested parties could provide software environment management services within the Boston, MA area. The T&amp;G PMO is pursuing a separate modernization effort in order to establish a lean, user-centered approach to software development that will ultimately redefine how Targeting &amp; GEOINT capability is delivered to the Air Force warfighter. Part of this approach includes a software environment that is conducive to paired programming and an Agile Software DevOps culture. The requirements include providing an environment, all required hardware (i.e. computers, laptops, peripherals, etc.), management of OEM warranties and repairs as needed, on-site full time presence to be able to quickly address any issues that arise, janitorial services, utilities and other services associated with managing an software environment. The Government will provide the program specific software that will then need to be maintained by the contractor providing the software environment management services. There will be both Government and contractor personnel working within the environment.</span></p>

<CONTACT>John A. Purcell, Email john.a.purcell15.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>Market Survey<br />M700 Time Blasting Fuse
<p><br />The Army Contracting Command, Rock Island, (ACC-RI) on behalf the Project Manager for Close Combat Systems (PM-CCS) is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing and delivering the following items:</p>
<p>Time Blasting Fuse, M700, (Type I), DODIC: M670, NSN: 1375-00-028-5246. The M700 Time Blasting Fuse (M700 Fuse) is used in military demolitions to ignite nonelectric blasting caps. The Fuse consists of a continuous delay train of black powder at its core, which transmits a spit of flame to the blasting cap. The burning rate of the fuse permits the operator to ignite the fuse and reach cover before detonation. The burning rate is 36.0 +/- 0.5 inch lengths of the fuse at sea level and 75&deg;F, shall not be less than 108 seconds and not greater than 122 seconds. The burn rate of the fuse is dependent on altitude, temperature conditions, and if used under water. The fuse is olive drab (General match to FED-STD-595 COLOR NO 34082,34083, 34088, 34127 OR 34130) with a yellow (General match to yellow per FED-STD-595 COLOR NO. 33538, 33655, or 33696) single band 1/4 inches wide every 18 inches and a double yellow band every 90 inches. The M700 is coiled in 50 ft increments. The fuse shall contain no more than one splice per 500 foot package.</p>
<p>Dummy Time Blasting Fuse, M700 (Type II), DODIC: M671, NSN: 1375-00-628-9033. The Dummy Time Blasting Fuse is of the same configuration as the corresponding Type I except it contains an inert material in place of the black powder. The Type II consists of a continuous inert mix simulating the black powder core of the live fuse. The fuse is Gold in color (General Match to FED-STD-595 COLOR NO. 17043). The marking color should be a general match to Black per FED-STD-595 COLOR NO. 37038. The fuse shall be marked "INERT" using not less than 1/8 inch high black lettering on each end and every 5 feet between ends of the 50 foot roll.</p>
<p>This survey is open to both large and small businesses. This survey is being conducted to evaluate the production capability of the existing base for the subject item. A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be used for this acquisition. The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards for this effort.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a contract to accommodate five (5) years of Government requirements. The Government's current budgeted M700 Fuse requirements are 200,000 FT for FY19 and 150,000 FT/year for FYs 20-23. The Government's current budget for the M700 Dummy Fuse is a onetime buy in FY 20 for 50,000 FT. A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) is requested per foot based on the above Government current budget for the M700 Fuse requirements.</p>
<p>Interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability. The response should also indicate the company's business size as it applies to NAICS Code 332993. Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production capability. A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in explosives processing industry. A respondent to this survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture this item. If a respondent does not have the adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and describe their ability to obtain these resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. All contractors interested in this potential future solicitation must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Interested parties have 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market survey should reference the M700 Time Blasting Fuse. Any response to this market research should include your company's name, address, CAGE code, point of contact, phone number and email address. Please submit responses to: U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, Attn: CCRC-AR, Mr. John A. Purcell, 3055 Rodman Avenue, Rock Island, IL 61299-8000, email: john.a.purcell15.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>This is a market survey that has been issued for planning purposes only and shall not be construed in any way as a Request or Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation on the part of the Government to acquire the aforementioned items. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses submitted to this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to assist in developing an acquisition strategy for future requirements. Please identify any proprietary information submitted.

Statement of Work
Lease Renewal for Ultra-Mist Therapy Systems
VA NJ HCS East Orange and Lyons, NJ

GENERAL INFORMATION

Title of Project: Lease Renewal and Continuation of rental of (5) Ultra-Mist Therapy System (CP-80030FA)., from Alliqua Biomedical,  (formally: Celleration, Inc.), , (561-18-3-457-0031 ), 
for EAST ORANGE VAMC and (4) for LYONS VAMC, (Currently this equipment is in use on  
both campuses).

Background:  Aillqua Biomedical, a (Small Business), is currently the sole FDA approved vendor   that uses low-frequency ultrasound waves and saline mist to promote healing in wounds.  The Mist Therapy has been used by the wound care nurses on both the VAMC East Orange and Lyons 
      campuses for the last (5) years. The system has been found to be very effective in aiding in the 
debridement and healing of all types of hard to heal wounds.  Previously most of the difficult to 
heal wounds would have to go to the operating room for the debridement process. With this system 
it can be done on the wards, in the patient s room, or during an office visit.  It has been found to be
highly effective in speeding up the healing in the majority of difficult and hard to heal wounds, according
to the wound care nurses that treat these patients on a daily basis.  The wound care nurses have been 
utilizing the Mist Therapy System, which was recently upgraded to another model and is now called 
the UltraMist Utrasound Healing Therapy System or (UltraMist Therapy System), with much 
success in the area of wound treatment. We are seeking to renew and continue the uninterrupted use of
this equipment in our facilities.  

Objectives:  To continue to maintain the use of the UltraMist Therapy System at both our campuses so that we may continue to maintain and improve the quality of patient wound care treatment through the use of the UltraMist Therapy System. We are requesting a sole source acquisition because there is no other product such as this on the current market that is as effective in the treatment of chronic and hard to heal wounds.

Scope of Work:  To provide inpatient/outpatient treatment of serious wound care therapy; provided by the Wound Care Nurse s at the Lyons CLC nursing home and the wound care clinic at the facility.

Tasks:  The leased equipment will perform as advertised in that it must be able to: 

Task #1 Provide a low-frequency ultrasound in kilohertz range to aid in the debridement and healing of wounds.

            Task #2 Provide ultrasonic energy to wounds via saline mist without direct skin contact.
 
            Task #3 Use of the UltraMist Therapy System should demonstrate an effective 
                           Improvement in the overall outcome of the  patient s wound health and healing.

Delivery: Equipment is delivered, returned and replaced at no cost to facility.           

 The vendor will provide the following:

Continue to provide (1) UltraMist Therapy Machine for East Orange Campus (CP-80030FA), which is already on station under current contract.
Continue to provide  (4) UltraMist Therapy Machines for the Lyons Campus (CP-80030FA), which is currently on station under current contract.

Government-Furnished Property (GFP):   N/A

Security Considerations:  Leased equipment maintained in a secure locked area.
There are no other special security requirements to use subject equipment.   

Travel: No travel is involved in the use of this equipment.

Special Material Requirements:  UltraMist Single Use Applicators, (CP-80034),  for use within the UltraMist Therapy System, as well as directly from the vendor, (Alliqua Biomedical).   To be purchased separately through the local IFCAP system.

Other Unique Requirements and Considerations:  None

Place of performance: On the VAMC East Orange and Lyons Campuses.
 
Performance Period:  04/01/18 through 03/31/19.  Requesting (2) year Renewal Option (Equipment is maintained on station)

<p>NAICS Code: 334519- Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing; corresponding size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Vaisala Model 425NWS ultrasonic wind sensor was deployed across the Automated Surface Observation System (ASOS) Network as a replacement for the original Belfort cup and vane style anemometer in the early 2000s and was expected to be in service through the early 2020s. However, critical repair parts are no longer available and the 425NWS is no longer supportable. The NWS is seeking a replacement anemometer capable of being integrated into ASOS with capabilities similar to the 425NWS. <br />&emsp;<br />Requirement: The National Weather Service (NWS) has a requirement for Ultrasonic Wind Sensors that measures wind speed and wind direction over a minimum range from 0 to 125 knots to replace the existing Vaisala model: 425NWS Ultrasonic Wind Sensors.  The NWS intends to purchase approximately 500 wind sensors to replace the 425NWS model.</p>
<p>The Governments objective is to acquire a commercial off-the-shelf ultrasonic wind sensor that is compliant with the meteorological performance of the current wind sensor, or that can be modified to be fully compliant with minimal developmental effort or risk.</p>
<p>The Government requires a low maintenance sensor that meets the performance requirements and meteorological conditions specified below:</p>
<p>Operational Environment: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall provide accurate reporting of wind speed, direction, and peaks without degradation of performance in severe outdoor environments consistent with all U.S. locations.  Specifically, the ultrasonic wind sensor shall continuously report wind speed, wind direction, and wind peaks in conditions of severe icing and heavy snow and/or blowing snow.  The Ultrasonic Wind sensor will be integrated into the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS).  It shall meet all requirements when exposed to any combination of the following environments:</p>
<p>Dust/pollen: Continuous exposure to wind driven respirable dust and/or pollen.<br />Salt Fog: Continuous exposure to severe coastal marine environment.<br />Temperature Extremes: Continuous exposure to a wide range of ambient temperatures.<br />Rain: Exposure to continuous heavy rain that may be experienced at any USA location.<br />Freezing Precipitation: Exposure to continuous freezing rain and/or drizzle.<br />Solar Insolation: Exposure to desert environments.<br />Electromagnetic Interference: Exposure to radio frequency energy as may be experienced in a typical airport environment.<br />Snow and blowing snow: Exposure to continuous white-out conditions due to snow and/or blowing snow.</p>
<p>Power and Signal Connections: The current wind sensor is mounted at the top of a ten (10) meter wind mast and is powered by a 24 VDC, 10 Amp power supply mounted at the base of the wind mast.  The current wind sensor power supply is powered by a 115 VAC, 3 Amp dedicated circuit.  The new ultrasonic wind sensor shall operate using either the existing single 24 VDC power supply or using the 115 VAC source already in place.  The sensor shall require less than 300 watts at 115 VAC, 60 Hz including heaters, if required.  The sensor shall be supplied with cables of 26 &plusmn;0.5 feet in length.  The length of all wires and cables shall be such that splices are unnecessary.</p>
<p>The sensor inputs and outputs shall be capable of communicating via standard RS232 serial protocols.  Internal signal connection terminals or an external data communications cable will be supplied with the unit.  If the sensor is supplied with a separate electronics/power supply enclosure, the enclosure shall contain an empty space suitable to mount a government furnished fiber optic modem on a mounting plate.  In this case, the enclosure shall be heated to withstand extreme cold operating conditions of -60 &deg;F.  The wind sensor shall communicate with the Government ASOS equipment already in place and accept queries and provide responses in ASCII format.  The query and response handling shall be configurable within the sensor software for compatibility with the legacy ASOS equipment.</p>
<p>Size: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall not exceed 32H x 14W x 14D inches.</p>
<p>Weight: No separate assembly of the ultrasonic wind sensor shall weigh more than thirty (30) pounds.  The weight of the sensor that mounts to the top of the wind mast shall be eight (8) pounds or less.  Hardware used to mount the sensor to the top of the wind mast shall be twenty-five (25) pounds or less.</p>
<p>Sensor Unique Requirements<br /> <br />Performance Requirements: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall meet the following performance requirements for wind speed, direction, and peaks.  The sensor shall report horizontal scalar wind speed values in knots and wind direction values in degrees.  The ASOS will poll the sensor via a RS232 serial interface and consist of a pair of American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) characters.  The poll will be sent and then ASOS will wait for the appropriate response. The sensor shall transmit an ASCII response to this interrogation within 250 milliseconds.  Control characters and control procedures shall be compatible with ANSI X 3.28 and ANSI X 3.66 respectively.</p>
<p>Wind Speed Requirements: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall report wind speed over a minimum range of 0 to 125 knots with an accuracy of &plusmn;2 knots or &plusmn;3% of the true wind speed, whichever is greater.  The wind speed shall be reported to a resolution of 0.1 knots.</p>
<p>Wind Direction Requirements: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall report wind direction from 0 to 360 degrees with an accuracy of &plusmn;4 degrees for wind speeds greater than or equal to 2 knots.  Wind direction shall be reported to the nearest degree.  The wind direction sensor shall meet the requirements for range, accuracy, and resolution over the range of reportable wind speeds specified in the wind speed requirements.</p>
<p>Performance Considerations: The ultrasonic wind sensor will operate in the natural environment.  Accordingly, the sensor shall be designed to be immune to detrimental effects in performance due to dust, smoke, insects, and spiders.  The mechanical design shall include appropriate deterrents to discourage perching and nesting birds.</p>
<p>Sensor Data Averaging: The ultrasonic wind sensor shall be designed with sampling rates sufficient to provide a user-selectable range of wind speed, peak wind speed, and wind direction averaging intervals from one (1) to thirty (30) seconds, in one (1) second increments.  The averaging intervals shall be configured through software commands and shall be stored in nonvolatile memory.  The wind speed reports shall be computed as independent, arithmetic averages, and shall be based on the most recent data samples available when the request for data is received by the sensor.  The wind direction reports shall also be computed as independent averages based on the most recent data samples, with an algorithm to resolve discontinuities in wind directions over the transition from 359 to 0 degrees..  Peak wind speed, direction, and peaks reports shall be computed as running arithmetic averages, updated once each second.  The maximum peak wind speed and associated direction observed since the last request for data shall be reported in response to the latest request for data.</p>

<DESC><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.<br />SSH20180070<br />This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; Veteran and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) to provide annual validation of Single Family Models and Commercial Models. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources. <br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Risk Management and Regulatory Affairs (ORMRA), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), is to annually validate the financial/actuarial models. 12 USC 1708(a) (4) states that the purpose of the independent actuarial study is to analyze the financial position of the following critical financial/actuarial models:</p>
<p>1. TASK A, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMIF), and<br />2. TASK B, the General Insurance and Special Risk Insurance (GI/SRI) account.<br /><br />1. Annual validation of different types of Single Family Models, <br />The intended uses of the Single-Family models to be validated are to:<br />&bull; Estimate FHAs liability for loan guaranty for the forward and HECM programs for FHAs financial statements;<br />&bull; Estimate selected elements of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund capital ratio; <br />&bull; Develop budget estimates (credit subsidy rates and volume) and re-estimates; and,<br />&bull; Estimate principal limit factors for Home Equity Conversion Mortgage.<br />2. Annual validation of different types of Commercial Models. <br />The intended uses of the commercial models to be validated are to:<br />&bull; Estimate FHAs liability for loan guaranty for the commercial loans for FHAs financial statements; <br />&bull; Develop budget estimates (credit subsidy rates and volume) and re-estimates</p>
<p><br />TASK A - SINGLE FAMILY (MMIF)</p>
<p>The MMIF is a group of accounts of the federal government in which transactions associated with FHAs guarantee programs for single family mortgages are recorded. FHA currently insures roughly 8 million forward mortgages with insurance-in-force of $1.1 trillion and 600,000 reverse mortgages with $112 billion in insurance-in-force under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program.<br /><br />The intended uses of the SINGLE-FAMILY models to be validated are to:<br />A. Estimate FHAs liability for loan guaranty for the forward and HECM programs for FHAs financial statements;<br />B. Estimate selected elements of the MMIF capital ratio; <br />C. Develop budget estimates (credit subsidy rates and volume) and re-estimates; and,<br />D. Estimate principal limit factors for HECM. <br /><br />SINGLE FAMILY models serve these four purposes:<br />(1) The forward mortgage insurance model is used to estimate the forward liability for loan guaranty, the forward elements of the MMIF capital ratio, forward budget re-estimates<br />and the credit subsidy elements of budget development. <br />(2) The forward volume model is used to generate the size and composition of each budget cohort. <br />(3) The HECM mortgage insurance model is used to estimate the HECM liability for loan guaranty, the HECM elements of the MMIF capital ratio, HECM budget re-estimates and the<br />credit subsidy elements of budget development. (HECM volume is projected to change in with the age eligible population. The composition of HECM budget cohorts reflects the<br />composition of recent books of business.) <br />(4) The HECM Principal Limit Factor (PLF) model is used to calculate principal limit factors by borrower age and interest rate.</p>
<p>TASK B - COMMERCIAL (GI/SRI)</p>
<p>The GI/SRI is a group of accounts of the federal government in which transactions associated with FHAs guarantee programs for Multifamily, Hospital, and Nursing Home/Assisted Living/Board &amp; Care facilities mortgages are recorded. FHA currently insures roughly 14,000 commercial mortgages with insurance-in-force of $100 billion in insurance-in-force.</p>
<p>The intended uses of the commercial models to be validated are to:</p>
<p>A. Estimate FHAs liability for loan guaranty for the commercial loans for FHAs financial statements; <br />B. Develop budget estimates (credit subsidy rates and volume) and re-estimates. <br /><br />The following TASK B - COMMERCIAL models serve these purposes:</p>
<p>FHA applies three different types of modeling frameworks to the commercial (multifamily and healthcare) portfolios:<br />I. Logistic Regression Models<br />II. Financial Simulation Model<br />III. Monte-Carlo Simulation Model</p>
<p>Within the logistic regression models, there are various sub-models. The differences between the sub-models are the variables and the types of loans or Risk Categories specified for each equation. But they are all structurally the same type of model, just with different variables. The list of the model categories and the sub-categories are:<br />I. Logistic Regression Models<br />1. Multifamily Apartment Claim Model<br />i. Unassisted New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Default Model<br />ii. Unassisted Refinance Default Model<br />iii. Assisted New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation and Refinance Default Model<br />iv. Claim Transition Model<br />2. Multifamily Apartment Prepayment Models<br />v. Unassisted New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Prepayment Model<br />vi. Unassisted Refinance Prepayment Model<br />vii. Assisted New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation and Refinance Prepayment Model<br />3. Residential Care Facilities (Nursing Home/Assisted Living/Board &amp; Care facilities) Models <br />viii. Section 232 New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Claim Model<br />ix. Section 232 Refinance Claim Model<br />x. Section 232 New Construction/Substantial Rehabilitation Prepayment Model<br />xi. Section 232 Refinance Prepayment Model<br />4. Hospital Loan Prepayment Model<br />xii. Section 242 Prepayment Model<br />II. Hospital Loan Financial Simulation Model<br />xiii. Section 242 Claim Model<br />III. Monte-Carlo Simulation Model<br />Stochastic Simulation Model with data input from all the previous models.</p>

<DESC><strong>Market Research (SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS ONLY)</strong><br /><br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This is NOT a request for proposals<br />or qualifications. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to<br />issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a request for information/market<br />research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing a request for qualifications. The Government is not obligated to<br />and WILL NOT pay for information received as a result of this announcement. Requests<br />for a solicitation will not receive a response.<br /><br />The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) is anticipating procuring Tenant Fit-out<br />Services for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Headquarters (DHS) Operations Center (DOC) located at the St Elizabeths West Campus, SE, Wash., DC. In July of 2009 GSA retained the team of Goody Clancy | HDR, LLC to provide programming and architecture/engineering (A/E) services for the design of the DOC. The original consolidation effort included the collocation of operations centers, decision support areas, and collaborative/support areas into a single facility at this location. The DOC was subsequently divided into two phases, DOC Block A and DOC Block B with DOC Block A being entirely below-grade and DOC B having both below-grade and above-grade structures as described in the May 1, 2011 "US Department of Homeland<br />Security (DHS) Consolidated National Operations Center 100% Construction Documents Narrative, Volume 4". DOC Block A was built and is a primarily an underground facility consisting of three below grade levels. However, DOC Block A tenant improvements and campus support infrastructure are incomplete and only areas supporting the St. Elizabeths campus Phase I development are complete in the DOC Block A. Therefore, DOC Block A will need to accommodate more of the highest priority operation centers within the unbuilt-out portions. In order to relocate the DHS Secretary (S1) to St. Elizabeths as planned, the National Operations Center Watch and Intelligence Watch and Warnings, their respective operational support elements, and the balance of the OPS Component (not included in the Center Building) all need to be constructed in DOC Block A now that DOC Block B will no longer be built. Phase 2B officially kicked off in March 2016 with the initial intent to provide the tenant fit-out of 4 user groups in the remainder of the DOC A space.<br /><br />The DOC A Phase 2B project in this 100% submission consists of several major elements:<br />-Tenant fit out for Office of Health Affairs Decision Support Center on Lower Level<br />3.<br />-Tenant fit out for Domestic Nuclear Detection Office Joint Analysis Center, DHS-<br />Secret Service and DHS-Immigration and Customs Enforcement Joint Intelligence<br />Operations Center on the Lower Level 2.<br />-Installation of raised floor in tenant spaces on Lower Levels 2 and 3.<br />-Fit-out of new Break Room on Lower Level 2<br />-Construction of a new communications closet on Lower Level 2.-Construction of new Pressurized Vestibule on Lower Level 1 at the access point to the tunnel to the West Addition.<br />-Reconfiguration of the cooling system of existing communications closet on Lower Level 2.
<p>This procurement is being conducted using the two phase selection process found in<br />FAR 36.3. Qualification proposals will be evaluated in Phase 1 to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase 2. One contract will be awarded using competitive negotiation. In Phase 1, GSA will select a short list of the most highly<br />qualified offerors and request that those offerors submit Phase 2 proposals. All<br />responsible sources may submit a Phase 1 proposal. A maximum of 5 firms will be<br />selected to submit Phase 2 proposals. Only those selected offerors are authorized to<br />submit Phase 2 proposals. Those offerors not selected for participation in Phase 2 will<br />be notified in accordance with FAR 15.503(a). In Phase 2, Offerors may submit a price<br />proposal subject to the Project Labor Agreement (PLA) requirements set forth in the<br />Phase 2 solicitation (a PLA proposal), a price proposal not subject to the PLA&nbsp;<br />requirements set forth in the Phase 2 solicitation, or both. Any price proposal submitted in Phase 2 shall clearly identify whether it is subject to such PLA requirements. The effort would have a performance period of approximately one (1) year and a project cost range between $4.0 and $8.0 Million.

<CONTACT>Ravin R. Andrews, Leasing Contract Specialist, Phone (253) 931-7052, Email Ravin.Andrews@gsa.gov
<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for February  is February 1, 2018 to February 7,2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG10 and must be located within Region 10.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR),  on behalf of the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I), Battlespace Awareness and Information Operations Program Office (PMW 120) intends extend the existing contract to  Hydroid, Inc. located at 1 Henry Drive, Pocasset, Massachusetts, 02559 to produce, Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs).  This extension is intended to be a bridge  with Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) CLINs for two (2) years (1 base year and 1 option year) to procure a total of four (4) Non- Developmental Item (NDI) UUV.  The Littoral Battlespace Sensing Autonomous Undersea Vehicle (LBS-AUV) specifically provides improved coverage, accuracy and precision of environmental characterizations, enabling the warfighter to make tactical adjustments to asset allocation by optimizing sensor and weapon platform placement and modes of operation to increase tactical effectiveness while reducing timelines and risk to forces.  They are moderately large, medium-endurance, electric motor-powered vehicles. The Government has a requirement to produce, deploy, and maintain AUVs that provide the Navy with an increased collection capability for persistent oceanographic data collection. The AUV consists of two variants, AN/WSQ- 43 (V) 1 and AN/WSQ-43(V) 2. The first variant is launched off of Transportation Auxiliary, Geodetic Survey (T-AGS) and the second variant is launched from submarine dry deck shelters.  This contract will only procure (V)2 variants.  In accordance with FAR 10, the Government released a Request For Information (RFI) for the purpose of conducting market research and to assess industry interest and capability to produce up to 16 non- developmental Full Rate Production (FRP) units, consisting of both LBS-AUV (AN/WSQ- 43 (V) 1) and LBS-AUV Submarine (S) (AN/WSQ-43 (V) 2) variants.

<p>I. <strong>SYNOPSIS</strong>:</p>

This is not a solicitation or a request for proposal (RFP) and no contract shall be awarded from this synopsis. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.</p>

Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition planning decisions.</p>
<p>c. The proposed work to be performed under the following North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code: 712120 - Historical Sites.</p>
<p>d. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District (NWS) anticipates soliciting and awarding one (1) purchase orders.</p>
<p>e. Overview of Project: This is a non-personnel services contract to perform fieldwork to remove headstones, re-excavate and realign pockets, and reinstall, and clean stones. Fieldwork will be performed by field crews under the supervision of a qualified masonry conservator. Data will be informed by site plans, historic photographs, National Register of Historic Places Determination of Eligibility, and the Cemetery Maintenance Plan. The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the services herein. Such contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn is responsible to the Government.

<p>f. Description of Project: Vancouver Post Cemetery was established in 1882. It is the fourth of four cemeteries associated with the Hudson's Bay Company and the US military, and includes some relocated military burials, as well as Native American burials, many of which are marked "unknown." There are also four Medal of Honor recipients buried at the Post cemetery. Most of the markers are the standard government-issue type established during the Civil War era, and consist of plane white marble with curved tops. There are also 159 private markers of varying types and sizes, some of which are sandstone. Approximately 20 of these are less than 50 years of age; 19 are flat headstones. <br />Because the cemetery is eligible for listing in the National Register, the 88th's management of its historic features and objects must comply with Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

<DESC>This is a sources sought for market research purposes only. The Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is conducting market research to determine the availability of contractors capable of delivering a functional refrigeration system for the Frost Effects Research Facility (FERF). This is not an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Quotation or a Request for Proposal. There is no obligation on the part of the government to acquire any of the services described herein. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought or any follow-up information requested.
<p>The Government is seeking responses to this sources sought synopsis from all interested businesses capable of providing these services. Small businesses in all socioeconomic categories (including Small, 8(a) Business Development Program, Historically Under Utilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB), Woman Owned (WOSB)) are highly encouraged to identify capabilities to meet the requirement for the ERDC.</p>
<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab (CRREL) in Hanover, New Hampshire has a requirement for the repair by replacement of the refrigeration system cooling both the Frost Effects Research Facility (FERF) and the existing Materiel Evaluation Facility (MEF). The requirement is to deliver a functional refrigeration system. The system requires repair by replacement to fix a number of ailing sub-systems, to change use of refrigerant (R22 banned for production by 2020) while still making use of the existing glycol working (heat transfer) fluid, and to improve certain functionality requirements (controls, monitoring, efficiency, other). Once repaired, the refrigeration system will be able to control ambient temperature in the facility while also rapidly cycling ground temperature through a number of freeze-thaw cycles through use of the FERF's 10 ft x 10 ft ground refrigeration panels.</p>
<p>The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The anticipated procurement strategy is to utilize the Design-Build approach which means combining design and construction in a single contract with one contractor.</p>
<p>Procurement objectives are as follows: 1) Functional Low-Temperature Refrigeration Loop, 2) Functional Medium-Temperature Refrigeration Loop, 3) Functional Hot Defrost Loop, 4) FERF air temperature at -7&deg;C when 25&deg;C measured outside air temperature, as measured from a thermometer held by person standing at least 10 feet away from ground position of air handler (hypocenter), 5) Operation of cold (low-temperature) loop in FERF sufficient to create permafrost in one (1) of four (4) test cells - 25% of full test volume area simultaneous to air-handler operation, 6) Alternatively, when FERF is not operating, MEF to maintain -30&deg;C when 25&deg;C measured outside air temperature, using low-temperature loop. Medium temperature loop can be switched off in this operational configuration, 7) User interface allows input of a control program that varies temperature and sub-system operation with the objective of holding temperatures specified above, self-alarming and capable of safe-shutdown, 8) Capable of operating for 96 hours continuously without human intervention and shutting down safely if error occurs during that period, and 9) R22 is eliminated from the FERF/MEF complex. <br />Responses to this sources sought are limited to ten pages.</p>
<p>The work described herein is anticipated to be Unclassified. Responses should identify whether Commercial Of-The-Shelf (COTS) solutions are potentially available. Responses should confirm bonding capability.</p>
<p>Interested companies responding to this sources sought should include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Company name, address, DUNS number, CAGE code, point of contact, telephone number and email address.<br />&bull; Information describing the company's capability to perform and past performance. Provide specific information on relevant work the same or similar in size and complexity. Include contract number, contract description, dollar value and a customer point of contact, telephone number and email address. Identify whether your firm was a prime vendor or subcontractor.<br />&bull; Provide the company's business size (small or other than small) and all applicable socio-economic category information (Small, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB)<br />&bull; Your responses shall be provided via email to the POC listed below and are due no later than 5:00 PM CST Tuesday January 22, 2018.</p>

<DESC>SOUCES SOUGHT NOTICE

The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (hubzone, 8(a), small, small disadvantage, service disabled veteran owned small business, or large business) relative to NAICS 624190, small business size standard is $11.0 M. 

Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, a solicitation announcement may be published on FBO.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not considered adequate responses to the solicitation announcement.  

The Department of Veterans Affair, Network Contracting Office 19, is seeking sources for a potential contract to provide an online interactive screening program to facilitate Veterans utilization of the chat program 

The intended contract period will be for a contractor to implement and assist with evaluating an evidence-based, online screening tool that will seamlessly link to the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) Chat program.  The online tool shall screen for depression, PTSD and other mental health problems and conditions that are associated with elevated risk for suicidal behavior in Veterans and military service personnel.  The performance period is one-year base and two (2) one-year option periods, all anticipated to begin April 1, 2018.  The service will be performed for:


VA Medical Center Canandaigua 
400 Fort Hill Avenue
Canandaigua, NY 14424

Veterans Online Interactive Screening Program

1. PERFORMANCE WORK STATMENT

1.1 Description of Services: The contractor will grant the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) a license to use an online interactive screening program, assist VCL staff in training Chat responders in the procedures for use of the online interactive screening program, provide ongoing technical assistance/support to the VCL, and collect/evaluate quantitative data.

1.2 Background:  There are approximately 25 million Veterans in the United States and 5 million Veterans who receive care within VHA. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate suicide rates among men between the ages of 20 and 65 at approximately 20 per 100,000 persons per year. VHA mental health officials estimate 6,400 suicides per year among Veterans, and 1,600-1,800 among veterans receiving health care from VHA. Recent reports have suggested that Veterans may be at an increased risk for conditions and behaviors associated with poor mental health including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and increased rates of substance use; all of which are established risk factors for suicide.

The VCL Chat program enables Veterans, along with their families and friends, to interact online, anonymously, and chat with a trained VCL responder. If the responder, after a mental health assessment, determines the user to be in a crisis, the responder can take immediate steps to transfer them to the VCL s 24/7 call center, where further counseling and referral services are provided. The VCL chat program is intended to reach out to all Veterans who may or may not be enrolled in the VA health care system, and provide them with online access to the VCL and the VA s suicide prevention services. For many Veterans, their first contact with VHA is through this program.

To help facilitate Veterans  utilization of the chat program and enhance the chat responders  ability to understand and respond effectively to Veteran-users, the VCL seeks to hire a contractor to develop, implement and assist in evaluating an online screening tool that would be seamlessly linked to the VCL Chat program. 

1.3 Objective:  

1.3.1  Develop, implement and assist in evaluating an online, evidence based, screening tool that would be seamlessly linked to the VCL chat program.  The online, evidence based, screening tool shall include symptoms of depression, PTSD and other mental health problems and conditions that are associated with elevated risk of suicidal behavior in Veteran and military service personnel. 
1.3.2  The design shall provide full and unlimited access to the assessment tool and all program functions from a smartphone or other mobile device and include a separate version of the assessment tool for family members and other advocates who wish to get help for a Veteran they are concerned about.

1.3.3  Each user s submitted screening shall be computer-classified into one of four tiers, depending on suicide risk, and routed to a live Chat responder who provides a personalized response to the user and encourages follow-up conversation through the VCL Chat service. Using the understanding gained through review of the information the user provided on his/her screening tool, the Chat responder can provide appropriate referrals to services and engage the user in exploring and resolving barriers and resistances to service utilization. 

1.3.4 An evaluation plan shall be implemented by the contractor and the VCL to measure the screening tool utilization and outcomes. The contractor and the VCL staff will collaborate in analyzing and interpreting the screening tool data. Results will be presented at several professional conferences, including the Annual Conference of the American Association of Suicidology (AAS). 

1.3.5  The contractor will work with VCL staff to analyze and interpret the data gathered through the online, interactive screening tool; conduct continued content analysis of a random sample of open-ended comments provided by users on the screening tool; and collaborate with VCL staff in presenting evaluation findings at conferences and in manuscripts intended for professional audiences.  

1.4 Period of Performance: The period of performance shall be for one base year with two (2) optional years as follows:

Base year: 1 April 2018 through 31 Mar 2019
Option Year 1: 1 April 2019 through 31 Mar 2020
Option Year 2: 1 April 2020 through 31 Mar 2021

REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Single Identity Service

This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued   to determine whether or not there are potential contractors capable of providing the information technology (IT) support described below.  The United States (U.S.) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting market research and desires input from industry to assist in obtaining the required services.  The information requested by this RFI will be used to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.  Please note: This request does not commit VA to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  VA is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that VA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future requests for proposal, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
Description of Requirement
Objective

VA has a need for a Single Identity Service (SIS) to manage both the Department of Defense (DoD) and VA patient identities in a combined Electronic Health Record.
Background

The mission of the VA, Office of Information & Technology (OI&T), Enterprise Project Management Office is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the U.S. In meeting these goals, OI&T strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient IT services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans  health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner. VA depends on Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.

The Veterans Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) is the single, integrated, authoritative, comprehensive, longitudinal Veteran health information system of VA.  For the past 35 years, 131 VISTA systems have provided all clinical, financial, and administrative functions to support all clinical and administrative operations of over 1,200 VA hospitals and clinics throughout the U.S. VISTA should therefore be considered the composite of an integrated electronic health record ( EHR ), and a federal health and resource management system including billing, scheduling, and enterprise resource management (collectively  ERP ).  In addition, over three decades of continuous operation and refinement, VISTA has become highly specific to Veteran care, benefits, business processes, government compliance, and regulatory reporting. 

VA leadership announced in June 2017 the decision to improve interoperability of the Veterans  health record with DoD by migration to a common commercial EHR.

VA is required under federal law to ensure interoperability between the VA and DoD medical record systems.  VA has chosen to expand the DoD Military Health System (MHS) Genesis system to meet this requirement thus eliminating the need to integrate two systems.  Sharing the same system requires VA and DoD to disambiguate patient records and patient Identifications (ID) to ensure that the correct patient record is presented.
 
VA maintains a unique identifier for all patients in the Master Veteran s Index (MVI).  In addition to the VistA medical records system, the MVI provides identity management services for all VA persons of interest and VA applications. The corresponding DoD system is the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS).  The DEERS Patient Discovery Web Service (PDWS) currently provides patient identity services to the production MHS Genesis System. 

To support the expansion of MHS Genesis for VA use, VA and DoD intend to modify the DoD-owned PDWS to create a SIS that will support joint patient identity management across both VA and DoD for integration into the combined Cerner Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform.  This includes patient enumeration, identity trait maintenance across both federal agencies and adding new patients to the combined Cerner EHR platform.  To accomplish this, joint DoD and VA business rules must be developed and agreed upon.  The SIS will act as the single point of patient identity management for the combined EHR.
SIS Requirements
The following functionality will be supported by the SIS:
Accept and respond to patient search/retrieve requests from the EHR. The response shall include patient ID and traits based on the business rules determined in part by the DoD/VA ownership of the patient.

Proxy add patient function between EHR and SIS to support the addition of patients to the EHR initiated by the Veterans Health Administration enrollment system.

Add patient functionality allowing the EHR to add patients to SIS in special circumstances when the standard enrollment process is not possible. 

Update patient traits in the EHR when information changes in the VA MVI.

Encode and implement business logic defining patient ownership between VA and DoD.

Place of Performance
All work will be performed at contractor offices.
Period of Performance
The period of performance will be five years from date of award.
Requested Time Frame
VA requires the SIS to be completed and available in a joint DoD/VA/Cerner test environment within 10 months of the VA EHR award to Cerner which is expected in early 2018.  Initial Operating Capability production deployment of the SIS is required 8 months after test availability.
Services Required

The contractor shall provide services to implement the SIS including data and business flow/logic analysis, establishment of an agile backlog, development, test, integration test with VA and EHR systems, and deployment support.  Post deployment support and sustainment services shall also be required for the life of the Interagency Agreement to address any defects and any required enhancements prioritized in the project backlog. 

*  The contractor must be preapproved by DoD to work on the DoD-owned PDWS system.  *
Requested Information
The Government requests the following information to aid in its analysis of the industry. The information requested below is limited to a maximum of 10 pages. The capability package must be clear, concise, and complete. VA is under no obligation to provide feedback to the company, or to contact the company for clarification of any information submitted in response to this request.
Company information

Company Name
Address
Point of Contact(s) (POC) name(s)
POC telephone number(s)
POC e-mail address(es)
Identification of business size

Identification of existing contract vehicles in which your company is participating that relates to the required services.
Past Experience 

This section should include a brief description of experience in providing support for requirements similar to the above in both size and magnitude. Notate the contract number, dollar value and POC information for each experience project provided. The Government is specifically interested in your experience providing the following:

Successful experience developing (enhancements to), and integrating Identity Management Systems in a multiagency environment
Successful experience integrating Cerner with federal agency enterprise identity management
Successful experience working with DoD DEERS PDWS and VA MVI systems
Successful experience developing a mission critical system with 99.9% availability while maintaining strict response time performance standards in a high volume transaction environment.

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Emerging Technologies Contracting Center (ACC-NJ, ET), Benet Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, NY on behalf of the US Army Armaments, Research, Development and Engineering Command (ARDEC), Benet Laboratories (BL) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole source contract with Trelleborg Sealing Solutions. This acquisition is being conducted using simplified acquisition procedures; however, responsible offerors may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Government. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 339991. BL is working with the US Army and the US Marine Corps to retrofit the M177A1 81mm Mortars with updated hardware. The Wear Rings and Seals are used in the Elevation Nut to reduce potential contamination of the internal components of the Elevation Upper Housing Assembly. The acquisition of these items is required to maintain readiness of the USMC fleet and to support the scheduled retrofit and fielding of the light-weight 81mm bipod system to the U.S. Army. The USMC has fielded the light-weight 81mm mortar system and requires these wear rings and seals as they are mandatory replacement parts consumed during semi-annual system maintenance. In the absence of available stock, field units are forced to either re-use these items rather, than replace them as required by the maintenance procedures, or deadline the weapon system. The technical data necessary to fabricate these items, to include the material specifications, is proprietary information, trademarked, developed and owned by Trelleborg Sealing Solutions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions. Responses must be received no later than 4:30PM Eastern Time on January 24, 2018. The point of contact for this requirement is Giuseppe Tropiano, ACC-NJ, ET, Bldg. 40, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet NY 12189-4000. Email: giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil.

<CONTACT>Brian D Serra, Email brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Industry Day Announcement<br />for<br />Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE)</strong></p>
<p>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, &amp; Instrumentation is hosting an Industry Day for the Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE).</p>
<p>When: Thursday, February 1st, 2018, 9:00am to 12:30pm <br />Where: 3039 Technology Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826, Partnership III Building, Room 321<br />Why: 1) Provide an updated overview of the PCTE requirement and 2) Kickoff for Cyber Innovation Challenge 2.</p>
<p>1) PCTE is a training platform that allows cyber mission forces (CMF) to train in emulated network environments utilizing current cyber tool suites. The evolution of the platform will largely focus on integration of available applications, enabling increased automation to ultimately support multiple simultaneous training events. At maturity, the DoD joint PCTE will be a constellation of federated, interoperable common training capabilities enabling full spectrum training from individual competencies to the team, unit, group and force training, exercises, TTP development and mission rehearsal.</p>
<p>2) Cyber Innovation Challenge 2 will be released through the Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX), with subsequent award(s) made as Other Transaction Agreements (OTAs) via sub-projects under TReX.</p>
<p>Cyber Innovation Challenge 2 focuses on enabling user access to the PCTE and training aids through an order portal, as well as the establishment and operation of a content repository. The portal capability should include a web-enabled user interface to provide the capability to check user authentication credentials, configure training, order training, schedule training, access training, and facilitate the production and distribution of user training assessments at the conclusion of the training event. This should allow authorized users to access the content repository to view existing training scenarios. In addition to the training managers and training audience using the order portal, it will allow the content repository to be accessed by CMF trainees, event designers and event managers. This should allow the creation, modification and deletion of training content as well as collaboration, searching and indexing content. These capabilities require the ability to operate simultaneously at multiple classification levels which should be shown by demonstrating the capability to segregate data according to simulated classification levels. These capabilities will be integrated within the PCTE development operations (DEVOPS) environment.</p>
<p>Any party interested in responding to this challenge (or future challenges) must be a member of TReX prior to the point of submittal. However, TReX membership is <strong>not</strong> required to attend this event.</p>
<p>There is limited space available at this event so all interested parties are encouraged to register as soon as possible at the registration link provided below. Registration will be limited to the first 180 registrants, with a maximum of two per company or academic institution. Government personnel interested in attending should contact Ms. Beth Hinds at elizabeth.a.hinds.ctr@mail.mil.</p>
<p>Attendees must provide Government issued identification upon arrival. Check in will begin at 0800. Foreign Nationals may not attend this event.</p>
<p><strong>Registration link:</strong> <a href="http://www.trainingaccelerator.org/new/pcteindustryday/">http://www.trainingaccelerator.org/new/pcteindustryday/</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> One-on-one sessions will not be held in conjunction with this event. An agenda will be published on the TReX website the week of the Industry Day.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PARKING:</strong> Due to limited parking in the Partnership II/III parking lot, all visitors must park in the large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway. The Partnership II/III parking lot is authorized parking for occupants only. Also, do not parking in the AT&amp;T parking lot as your car will be subject to being towed.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.</p>

<SUBJECT>Face Identification at a Distance Needs Statement
<SOLNBR>RRTO-20180108-W-FIAD
<RESPDATE>020518
<CONTACT>OUSD ATL Defense Biometrics, Email osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.defense-biometrics@mail.mil
<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Face Identification at a Distance Needs Statement<br /><br /></strong><strong>Response Date: 5pm EST February 5, 2018<br /><br /></strong></div>
The Department of Defense's Defense Biometric and Forensic Office (DBFO) is looking for White Papers that present technical solutions to the Department's Face Identification at a Distance (FIAD) problem-namely, the inability to identify faces in unconstrained environments (e.g., extreme pose angles, partially covered faces, low illumination, etc.) in real-time while operating from safe or concealed locations at long distances. To better illustrate this problem, DBFO developed the two use cases below. Organizations are invited to submit White Papers that address each use case. Please refer to attachment "Face Identification at a Distance Attributes" for additional information on the system attributes that DoD anticipates the solutions should possess. If there is interest in the White Paper, organizations may be invited to discuss their proposed solution with the DBFO team. <br /><br /><strong>Use Case #1: Small Unit Dismounted Intelligence or Surveillance Mission </strong><br />A small unit (2-12 operators) conducts intelligence or surveillance operations on foot in their area of responsibility. One of the unit's operators collects still and video images of persons of interest using a mobile handheld system. To maximize the effectiveness of their mission and minimize the threat of small arms fire, the unit operates at distances greater than 300 meters. The handheld system automatically detects and enhances faces in each image and automatically matches the face(s) to a "bad guy" watchlist that is loaded on the handheld device. When a match is made, the operator receives a visible and audible notification and follows established tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These images are used by senior leadership as decision aids-not as a targeting tool for the small unit. During missions, the unit often operates without wireless or cell connectivity. As a result, facial images collected and enhanced are stored on the handheld device. When connectivity is established, the stored images are transmitted to DoD's biometric database for secondary matching. <br /><br /><strong>Use Case #2: Forward Operating Base Force Protection </strong><br />Forward operating bases (FOBs) are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. To reduce this threat, sensors are mounted on buildings and towers located on the perimeter of FOBs and at entry control points. Controlled by security personnel at the base, these sensors automatically or selectively scan the area outside the FOB 24/7 capturing video of individuals and crowds at various distances. The capability to identify dangerous individuals at long distances (greater than 650 meters) improves the security forces' ability to protect the FOB and the personnel inside. The live video is fed to a guard station and is simultaneously processed by a local server to automatically detect and enhance faces in the video stream. Once detected and enhanced, face images are automatically matched to a "bad guy" watchlist resident on the local server. When a match is made, operators in the guard shack receive a visible and audible notification and follow established tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). These images are used by senior leadership as decision aids-not as a targeting tool for the FOB's security forces. Facial images collected and enhanced are retained on the local system and, given adequate communications capability, are transmitted to DoD's biometric database for secondary matching. <br /><br /><strong>Organizations interested in responding to this notice should submit a two-page White Paper via e-mail: osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.defense-biometrics@mail.mil. The email subject line should read "Face Identification at a Distance Solution White Paper."</strong><br /><br />The following information is required in the White Paper (Note: Organizations should limit their submission to only one White Paper for each use case):<br />&nbsp; 1. Organization name<br />&nbsp; 2. Website address<br />&nbsp; 3. POC, email, phone number, and an alternate POC if desired<br />&nbsp; 4. Identification of the use case your technology intends to address<br />&nbsp; 5. A maximum two-page description of the organization's proposed solution<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (to include the information above)<br /><br /><strong>All White Papers must be received on or before 5:00 PM EST on February 5, 2018. </strong><br />Organizations are responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this notice.<br />

<DESC>This solicitation is a direct source for the SBIR &nbsp;Phase III Standard work process and implementation.<br /><br />A key SBIR/STTR component is that, once a company has received a Phase I or II award, Phase III awards can be made to the company using a non-competitive/sole-source process, since competition requirements were satisfied under Phase I and II. Air Force SBIR/STTR Program Managers and Deputy Program Managers play an influential role in the Air Force SBIR/STTR program in topic development, technical oversight of Phase I and Phase II projects and planning Phase III actions to help integrate a new technology into a Program of Record or other program. SBIR/STTR project development typically extends over a minimum of three years.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<BR><BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

General Background Information

It is the policy of the VA through VA Directive 6371 that all paper records under the jurisdiction of the VA will be handled by the most secure, economical and effective means in accordance with legal requirements.  PII is the most sensitive form of information handled at the VA and, therefore, requires the use of extraordinary procedures for its protection.  PII that is not properly disposed of can result in actual or potential identity theft and cause personal hardship to the subject individuals.  It is imperative that the appropriate means of destruction be used for all VA temporary paper records.

With the implementation of new and enhanced regulatory criteria and the need for a systematic secured and trackable process, a comprehensive solution is sought by VA Maine Healthcare System to ensure compliance with all Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) regulations and VA Directive 6371.  This process shall include but not be limited to being HIPAA compliant and defined and trackable from each point in the process.

36 C.F.R. 1228.58 Destruction of Temporary Records

Contractor will be required to provide a written policy regarding how they will ensure that their personnel will be scrutinized in the hiring, training, monitoring of compliance to ensure minimal risk due to human error.

Contractor shall provide a written pick-up schedule to the Contracting Officer s Point of Contact (POC) which will be followed to ensure adequate coverage for all locations.  All CBOC s require a monthly pickup (at least) per section II of this PWS.

Contractor will be required to provide lockable containers at each CBOC and at the pickup locations on the main VAMHS campus.  Containers must be in compliance with JACHO and HIPAA standards at the point of collection, as well as the centralized collection location, at each site.  Collection containers distributed throughout the VAMHS facilities must be secured in a manner that prohibits unauthorized individuals from accessing paper records identified for destruction that have been deposited into them.  These containers must provide reasonable physical safeguards which may include, among other measures, locks or placement in secure areas.  

Contractor personnel will pick up materials from the secure point-of-collection containers.

Contractor will be required to provide shredding services on-site so that no confidential materials are removed from the premises before shredding is completed.  

Contractor will be required to provide documentation of the pick   up at each collection point and the total weight of all materials shredded in a monthly report.

Contractor shall be bonded, insured, NAID certified for paper/printed media destruction and can provide reasonable physical safeguards for the data throughout the destruction process.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Program Assistant is a member of one of DCHA/OTI's Regional Teams in the Field Programs Division (FPD), reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC.  OTI currently has five regional teams as part of its Field Programs Division (FPD): Africa (AFR), Europe and Asia (EA), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), Middle East (ME), and Pakistan.  OTI's Regional Teams are responsible for all program implementation-related activity in the specific region.</p>
<p>The Program Assistant's principal responsibility is to assist one of OTI's regional teams in the administration and management of existing country programs and participates in new country program assessments as the need arises. This is a program-funded USPSC position, focused on country program implementation support. The Program Assistant must have a strong interest in assisting countries in transition and be able to accomplish a wide range of administrative functions (budget and financial preparation and management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change. The successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, be able to build and maintain collaborative relationships with staff in other support divisions and possess a well-developed understanding of US policy interests.</p>

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/.<BR><BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause 
Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item 
(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is 
(i) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition at FAR 2.101);
(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and
(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without
modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and
(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C.
App. 1702), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.
Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.
Cost of components means 
(1) For components purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including transportation
costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs are paid to a
domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued); or
(2) For components manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the manufacture of
the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this definition, plus
allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components does not include any costs
associated with the manufacture of the end product.
Domestic end product means 
(1) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;
(2) An end product manufactured in the United States, if 
(i) The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States
exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the
same class or kind as those that the agency determines are not mined, produced, or
manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a
satisfactory quality are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for
processing in the United States is considered domestic; or
(ii) The end product is a COTS item.
End product means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under the contract for public
use.
Foreign end product means an end product other than a domestic end product.
United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.
(b) The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a - 10d) provides a preference for domestic end products for
supplies acquired for use in the United States. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of
the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (See 12.505(a)(1)).
(c) Offerors may obtain from the Contracting Officer a list of foreign articles that the Contracting
Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.
(d) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products except to the extent that it specified
delivery of foreign end products in the provision of the solicitation entitled Buy American Act
Certificate.<BR><BR>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.<BR><BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<BR><BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<BR><BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<BR><BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items:

Question
Answer
1.
2.6.1.1.
Is receiving site on 2401 Tulane St. and install site (rooms for equipment 2.5.9. and 2.5.10), connected, or accessible by walking, in order to place the equipment to the designated rooms?    
Yes. The Research Building is within walking distance from the main receiving area (Central Energy Plant/CEP Building). The Research Building and CEP have separate loading docks that are both accessible from 2401 Tulane Street. Interested contractors can also request a site map of the facility from the point of contact listed on the solicitation if more information is needed about the site. 
2.
2.61.3, 2.6.1.4 and 2.6.1.5
Can products remain at receiving area until installation?
No. The receiving area is not equipped for storage. When items are delivered, they must be transported to a secure area in the Research Section. (There are secure areas in the Research Section where delivered items can be stored while they await placement in rooms, and/or set up/installation).
3.
2.6.2.1
Does item 0009 or item 0010 need to be fastened to the floor or just placed on the floor of the designated rooms?
Items 0009 and Items 0010 do not require floor mounting. 
4.
2.5.9
Comment: Item on 2.5.9 describes; Table, Examination/treatment, Animal.  The suggested manufacturer (Blickman) describes product #7847SS as  instrument tables . These types of tables are designed for instruments, not necessarily animals, especially large, heavy species.  Suburban Surgical has a  equal to  product and we are happy to quote, however our instrument tables, as Blickman s,  are designed as described.  Question: What are the weight requirements for this table?
Weight requirements are not available and cannot be provided for the Blickman Table referenced in Section 2.5.9 of the Statement of Work. (The manufacturer/manufacturer s website does not provide minimum/maximum weight requirements for this specific table). The (Blickman) table is designed for instruments and rodents. If the Blickman table cannot be provided contractors must provide a table that meets all salient characteristics (as annotated in the Statement of Work) that can support lightweight usage. We are a small animal facility (with primarily rodents). 
5.
2.6.1.1
Can we hold products at our own facility, and ship when installation area is ready, instead of pre delivering to Energy Plant Building?
Yes, just as long as installation can be completed when scheduled.
6.
2.5.1
The unit specified: AllerGard ES (Energy Saver) NU-619 Dual Access Animal Transfer Station is specific to a caging system called Innovive.  Is the 620 model the correct unit?
The 620 unit is acceptable; Must be dual access.
7.
2.5.3
In statement 2.5.3 you specifically call out for a two-way manifold, but a few lines later you say no less than 4 to 6 way splitter manifolds. Please confirm quantity of manifolds needed.

The correct model for Section 2.5.3 is Model V3000PK. There should be two (2) induction chambers and no less than four (4) manifolds. Please refer to the subsequent amendment/rewrite of Section 2.5.3 of the Statement of Work.
8.
2.5.4
In statement 2.5.4 you call out hoses and connects to an induction chamber, but no chamber. Is a chamber needed or not?

No chamber is needed. Please refer to the subsequent amendment/rewrite of Section 2.5.4 of the Statement of Work.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The Air University (AU), Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, seeks already developed curriculum to build approximately 20 hours of a transformative and highly experiential leadership curriculum for a new Human Domain Leadership Course (HDLC). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>AU is interested in identifying companies that have the ability to initially teach classes (up to 24 times a year) and also provide "train-the-trainer" for a seamless transition as government employees are assigned to move the mission from offeror to in-house operations. The curriculum will represent roughly the first 2.5 days of a 5-day course for personnel selected to their first command assignment (i.e., high potential officers typically at the 12-18 year point of commissioned service). Most students will already have had leadership education of some sort earlier in their career, so the curriculum should be highly impactful in order to reframe the students' self-perspective in their role as a leader. The curriculum should include both platform and interactive-based lessons, and achieve objectives in both the affective and cognitive learning domains. The curriculum must address the complexities of the human domain as it relates to leadership; be grounded in current academic research on leadership, management, and communication; and have strong linkage to industry best practices. It must also be highly applicable to Air Force (AF) squadron commanders, or have the ability to be adapted to an AF squadron command via integration meetings with AF representatives and the course director. </span></p>

<DESC>This procurement is for the design-bid-build (DBB) construction of Military Construction (MCON) project P-834 SEAWOLF Class Service Pier Extension, Naval Base Kitsap Bangor, Silverdale, WA. This procurement uses the source selection procedures in accordance with FAR Part 15, and will be solicited utilizing full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.1. 

Source Selection procedures will be used with the intent to award a firm-fixed-price construction contract to the responsible Offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), offers the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff source selection process.   The tradeoff process is being utilized because it may be in the Governments best interest to consider award to other than the lowest price Offeror or other than the highest technically rated Offeror.
   

This project constructs a 520 foot x 68 foot single level, reinforced concrete, general purpose submarine berthing pier extension to the existing service pier, with pier-side utilities, communication systems, and two 580 square foot concrete floating camels.  The pier extension includes engineered piles and caps to support the pier deck, a fixed crane, equipment pads, mobile cranes, and utility buildings.  The project also reconfigures and adds to the existing wave screen attenuation system and modifies the existing small craft berthing at the service pier.

Additionally the project constructs a low-rise compressor building on the pier for new tool air compressors and breathing air compressors and alters an existing building to accommodate new and existing lift stations, sewage equipment, storm drainage, industrial wastewater services, and provides a new emergency generator.
 

The project will be located at Naval Base Kitsap Bangor in Silverdale, WA. The estimated total contract price range, in accordance with DFARS 236.204, is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.

This procurement shall be in accordance with Buy American clauses FAR 52.225-11 and 12. The firm needs to be able to demonstrate knowledge, current relevant qualifications, experience, bonding, and the capability to perform a construction contract similar to the scope indicated. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: 

Factor 1  Experience 
Factor 2  Past Performance
Factor 3  Safety
Factor 4  Technical Solution
Factor 5  Small Business Utilization
Price 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.
 The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) https://www.neco.navy.mil/ on or about January 22, 2018. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the website. Plan holders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above. 

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this announcement, attending pre-proposal conferences or any follow-up information requests.  

Results of Sources Sought
A market survey was completed by posting a Sources Sought under solicitation N4425517MKTG6 on FBO and NECO on August 29, 2017 with a due date of September 13, 2017.
   The sources sought requested responses from interested prime contractors and statements of capabilities.   The Government received a total of two responses from small business concerns.  An analysis was made of the responses, and the respondents could not be considered qualified based on the submissions.   The sources sought analysis was provided to the SBA with the DD 2579 documentation.  Additionally the Government performed various searches on the dynamic small business search website to identify potential capable small business.  As a result of the market research, the contracting officer has determined there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.
  The Activity Small Business Office concurs with this decision.

<DESC>CANCELLED NOTICE<br />THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE <br />SSH20180010
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of qualified small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, HUBZone firms; Veteran and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses and Economically Disadvantaged Women-owned Small Business (EDWOSB) to provide. <br />an on-line subscription to help comply with statutory requirements regarding Capital Ratios, Budget Re-estimates, Credit Reforms, and Credit Risk Analysis. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) insures an average of approximately $40 billion in multifamily rental projects each year. In doing so, it evaluates the market absorption potential for these projects and how they relate to existing projects in the market. HUD has two objectives. One is to avoid financing projects in markets where it is anticipated there will be an excess supply of rental units by the time the project is completed, thereby reducing the risk of default for the proposed project. The other is to avoid increasing vacancy levels above desired levels in the market to reduce the risk to financial viability of existing rental projects, some of whose mortgages HUD may have insured. Most of HUD's multifamily mortgage business is concentrated in metropolitan areas, especially large, fast-growing areas. Detailed information on the location, type, rents, and vacancy rates of existing and newly developed multifamily rental projects is highly valuable in estimating the impacts and potential absorption of rental projects applying for HUD mortgage insurance or subsidy assistance. A limited amount of rental vacancy rate data is available from the Bureau of the Census. This information is collected in greater detail for multifamily rental projects by a limited number of firms that sell it to interested parties in a standardized format. HUD is interested in purchasing such data to assist it in carrying out its market analysis functions. <br />Provide capability of the following tasks:</p>
<p>I. Housing Market Analysis Data<br />All rent comparability, submarket and metropolitan market report for 165 primary, secondary and tertiary metropolitan multifamily markets, including quarterly executive-level summary data, rankings and analyses on U.S. and regional markets, as well as a variety of special research studies. For the 50 primary metropolitan markets, this data includes:</p>
<p>A. Details on supply, demand, vacancies, rents, and related market indicators on metropolitan markets for the multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Submarket-level detail for multifamily, office and retail markets are included. Annual and quarterly trends are presented, along with five-year forecasts. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>B. Metropolitan market and submarket details on supply, demand, rents and vacancies for Class A and B/C properties for the multifamily and office sectors. Annual and quarterly trends are presented. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>C. Aggregate and property-specific rent comp group reports including rents and vacancies, in addition to five-year historical trends for aggregate rent comp groups for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) and Excel (xls) formats.</p>
<p>D. Individual property sales, including transaction and property characteristics for multifamily, office, retail and industrial sectors. Updated weekly.</p>
<p>E. Economic and real estate analysis in narrative form on most metropolitan areas. The reports discuss key multifamily, office, retail and industrial supply and demand trends in each metropolitan market, pinpoint under-performing and outperforming submarkets. Now updated monthly. Available in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format.<br /><br />F. Current market indicators across all submarkets in each metropolitan market, including rents, vacancies, free rent concessions, and expenses for multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly. Available in Excel (xls) format.</p>
<p>G. Building-level listings and summary statistics for submarkets and metropolitan markets are presented of planned/proposed, projects under construction and recently completed for the multifamily, office and retail sectors. Now updated monthly.</p>
<p>H. Daily real estate and economic stories are posted from the leading local newspapers and periodicals across the nation, initially coded into relevant metropolitan markets and topic categories (e.g. multifamily construction). A searchable 90-day archive is maintained. Updated daily and available in an HTML format.</p>
<p>II. Data Files<br />EXCEL data files with supply demand and rent time series data (from 1980 in most<br />markets) for the Primary Markets and selected market aggregations are extractable for all database variables for the 30 secondary metropolitan markets data and reports provided in the following: <br />(a), but without the forecasts;<br />(c), but without the historical trends; and<br />(g) and (h) are available.</p>
<p>For the 85-tertiary metropolitan markets the information provided is the same as for the secondary markets, with less submarket details and historical data is limited to the past 3-4 years.</p>
<p>III. Sales Comp Module</p>
<p>A database of apartment transactions valued at $2 million or more in all 80 primary and secondary markets and for 85 tertiary markets.</p>
<p>IV. Transaction Analytics Module<br />This is a database that includes sales transaction activity. It provides mean, median and 12-month-rolling cap rates, sales price data by price per unit or square foot, and total transaction volume. Transaction trends are available by quarter back to 2005 for metropolitan areas, regions, and the U.S. This module also provides data on top deals, with buyer and seller information, and on key submarket transaction activity. HUD will use this information to identify sales and capital market trends in the multifamily real estate market and assess troubled debt.</p>
<p>V. Single Property Valuation Tool<br /><br />Allows the user to enter their assumptions or observations on current building performance, select a variety of forecast options based on observations and predictions at the submarket and metro levels, and select some final assumptions in terms of terminal cap rates, additional income and other variable affecting property value. The result is three distinct market values based on the DCF, Sales Comp and Direct Cap methodologies.</p>
<p>VI. Expanding Markets<br />Currently FHA has access to 200 apartment markets throughout the United States. With this acquisition HUD will have access to an additional 75 markets</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this RFI Amendment 1 is to post Government responses to the following preliminary questions received -
<p>1. Who is the incumbent contractor and associated contract number?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: Maximus Federal Services, Inc., HHSN316201600006W | DOL-OPS-16-F-00132</p>
<p>2. CMMI Level 3 Services accreditation seems to meet all the Government's requirements. What additional requirements does the Government have that require a CMMI Level 5 Services accredited contractor?</p>
<p>RESPONSE: DOL opines a CMMI Lvl 5 accreditation rating is required to achieve its objectives of optimizing and improving its current processes, i.e. transitioning from a "defined processes" environment (i.e. comparable to that of a CMMI Lvl 3 organization) to one of a "sustainable focus on process improvement" (i.e. comparable to a CMMI Lvl 5 organization).</p>
<p>3. Regarding language stating that "ENTOM" is complementary to the older RFI ending in "-0005" -</p>
<p>RESPONSE: This is *not* a new requirement for the Government, but rather a continuation of the current support DOL receives; both RFIs are in aid of flushing out a single requirement/acquisition.</p>
<p>4. Any information as it relates to the size of the contract.</p>
<p>RESPONSE: DOL anticipates awarding an enterprise-wide/level vehicle based on its requirements.</p>

<ARCHDATE>01192018
<CONTACT>James Robinson, Email James.R.Robinson@uscg.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to synopsize a six-month extension on an existing competitively awarded contract. The USCG intends to extend the duration of existing contract HSCG23-13-D-PMF003 by six months. HSCG23-13-D-PMF003 and all of its options were fully competed at the time of award, except for the six-month option to extend services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services (NOV 1999). FAR 52.217-8 was included in the contract's clauses at the time of solicitation and award, but it was not competed during the solicitation phase.
<p>This is a contract extension for the continued SAPS requirement. SAPS is an essential component of the FMS mission. SAPS support allows the USCG to provide a wide range of services on vessels being transferred to other nations around the globe. Without continuity of operations for uninterrupted SAPS service, a gap in service would adversely impact the core mission of providing timely maritime vessel transfers to foreign nations. Without SAPS, the USCG would experience significant delays in the transference of these vessels under the Excess Defense Article (EDA) Program, discredit our service commitment to provide these mission critical services, and possibly impact international relations due to delays and lose of continuity of operations.</p>
<p>It has been determined that proceeding directly with action was appropriate to be concurrent with the synopsis period in order to prevent a lapse in service that could seriously discredit the Coast Guard in the eyes of the international maritime community. A new contract to continue contract in its entirety is forthcoming. <br /><br />The new contract is currently planned to be an open market competitive contract to be awarded no later than July 23, 2018.</p>
<p>This extension period has the following CLINs:</p>
<p>CLIN 50001: Firm Fixed Price Services CLIN</p>
<p>CLIN 50002: T&amp;M Services CLIN</p>
<p>CLIN 50003: ODC CLIN</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions submitted by vendors as well as the Government s responses.

Question and Answers   December 20, 2017
Single Identity Service   Request for Information
What are the specific rules and/or processes that must be adhered to and followed in order to be preapproved by DoD to work on the DoD-owned PDWS system?

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not have information on the requirements to be approved by the Department of Defense (DoD) for access to the system.  VA expects the contractor to have the experience needed to meet this requirement.

Is there a DoD contact to whom we can speak with about the rules and/or processes to obtain pre-approval from DoD to work on the DoD-owned PDWS system?

VA does not have a contact for DoD authorization.

The RFI appears to have language that indicates SIS is both a service and a system (e.g.;  1.3 - SIS Requirements: Add patient functionality allowing the EHR to add patients to SIS in special circumstances when the standard enrollment process is not possible. ; and  2.2.4 - Successful experience developing a mission critical system with 99.9% availability while maintaining strict response time performance standards in a high volume transaction environment ). Can the government clarify if the Single Identity Service is to be (1) an enhanced Web Service (i.e.; Enhance PDWS to check with MVI as well as DEERS) or (2) a newly developed system that also supports an enhanced Web Service (i.e.; Enhance PDWS to check with MVI as well as DEERS)?


VA anticipates this is a modification of the existing Patient Discovery Web Service (PDWS) service.  VA requires a service that meets the functional and operational requirements including 99.9% availability.

Would you be available for a phone call on Tuesday, December 19, to discuss these questions? 

VA is not able to provide details beyond what is provided in the RFI and the responses to these questions.

When should we expect answers to these questions? 

 The responses to these questions will be posted on December 21, 2017.

Is the subject effort a new requirement or a follow-on to an existing contract?  If the latter, can I please find out the incumbent contractor s name and contract number?

This is a new requirement for VA.  DoD currently has contracts in place to support PDWS.

<DESC>This is a notice of award to Executive Information Systems for SAS software and maintenance.
<p>SAS is the sole product that can meet our mission critical needs. To use a product other than SAS software, the Bureau would be forced to expend millions of dollars to reprogram these systems in other languages not specially optimized for Bureau statistical systems.  Additionally, such a transition would take years to complete, considering the enormous task of analysis, design, coding, and testing of all BLS systems currently using SAS, and the amount of training required.</p>
<p>BLS surveyed the project leaders for the major SAS shops regarding the costs that they would incur to convert to a new statistical software package that hypothetically would replace SAS.  The estimate for the conversion effort was $76,565,000 over at least 5 years.  This does not include the cost of the actual replacement software which, of course, would have to be licensed in parallel with SAS until conversion is complete.</p>
<p>SAS Institute, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of SAS products.  Enterprise Integration Technologies is SAS's sole re-seller to the Federal Government on GSA Schedule (GS-35F-0170K).</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:__VA250-18-AP-2277______

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 10, Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center, 1500 Weiss Street, Saginaw, Michigan 48602.  The 2237 number is 655-18-2-921-0005.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This is a request for a sole source for a firm-fixed price bridge contract to Mobile Medical Response, Inc. (834 South Washington, Saginaw, Michigan, 48601; (989) 758-2900) for 24 hour ambulance services for beneficiaries of the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center.  FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  In accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2.  

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  
Mobile Medical Response, Inc. will provide 24 hour Basic Life Support (BLS) Ambulance Service and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) in accordance with local, state, and federal laws for beneficiaries of the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center, 1500 Weiss Street, Saginaw, Michigan, for the time period of January 16, 2018   May 31, 2018.   The contractor shall perform required services in accordance with the standards of the Commission on Accreditation of Ambulance Services (CAAS).  

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 (x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Mobile Medical Response, Inc. currently provides these services to the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center under contract VA251-13-D-0029, which expires January 15, 2018.  The end user did not submit the appropriate documentation for a follow-on contract until November 29, 2018.  This does not provide ample time to compete and negotiate a short-term contract, as the procurement lead time for a competitive contract of its estimated dollar value is 153 days.  Furthermore, even if this requirement were competed in this short timeframe, it is not enough time to get a new contractor established.  Prior to commencing work, a new contractor would need to meet various requirements, including the inspection of their facility and all vehicles intended for use under this contract prior to beginning work.  As such, a sole source bridge is being sought for the time period of January 16   May 31, 2018 so that a new five-year contract can be competed and put in place.     

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A sources sought notice was issued on FBO on December 1, 2017 (36C25018Q0170).  At the time the notice expired on December 5, 2017 at 12:00 Eastern, no responses were received.  
  
Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The anticipated cost to the Government is expected to be fair and reasonable through price comparison with the prior contract with Mobile Medical Response, Inc. for identical services provided from 2013-present (VA251-13-D-0029).   The IGCE submitted reflects the current price bring paid for these services, and the price quotation to be received from Mobile Market Response, Inc. will be analyzed and compared with the price of services provided in the past.  

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  A sources sought notice was issued on FBO on December 1, 2017 (36C25018Q0170).  At the time the notice expired on December 5, 2017 at 12:00pm Eastern, no responses were received.  

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: N/A

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The VA will research the market again as a contract for ambulance services beginning June 1, 2018 is pursued.  

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
