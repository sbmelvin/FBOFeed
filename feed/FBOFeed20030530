<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition & Logistics Division, on behalf of the Electricity Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Andeen Hagerling, Inc. of Cleveland, OH, for Fused-Silica Capacitance Standards and Capacitance Standard Frames.*** 

Sole source determination is based on the need for fused-silica capacitance standards of high enough precision to be used as capacitance reference standards at NIST.  NIST is the best in the world at capacitance realization, via the NIST Calculable Capacitor. In order for NIST to provide the best capacitance calibrations, NIST has the need for the best capacitance standards and transfer standards.  Presently, NIST calibrates fused-silica standard capacitors at 1 kHz with an expanded (k=2) uncertainty of 0.5 parts in ten to the sixth.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for a formal proposal. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from potential contractors for the “Development of Enrichment and Selective Culture Media for the Isolation of Special Pathogens from High Priority Foods.” Recent events have reinforced the importance of FDA’s long-standing interest in the development of improved methods for the identification of potential threat agents in foods.  CFSAN maintains an active research program for developing and enhancing methodologies to detect and identify microbial hazards that may contaminate food and food products either naturally or through deliberate contamination.  Standard protocols for isolation of the most commonly occurring pathogens have been developed.  Traditionally, these protocols rely on enrichment and selective culture media for the isolation of a pathogen from the food.  CFSAN needs to further enhance its detection and identification capabilities with respect to pathogens that are not typically considered to be foodborne pathogens.  Specifically, there is a need to develop bacterial growth media that will improve the recovery of these atypical pathogens from priority food matrices.  Initial efforts will focus specifically in the detection of Brucella and Burkholderia species associated with human disease. 

Statement of Work

The contract shall include preliminary assessment of growth and isolation characteristics of pure culture isolates in media from commercial or other sources.  Furthermore, selected media preparations which have been found to hold the greatest promise for fulfillment of the goals will be evaluated for use with representative food matrix categories of interest.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work. 
The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement.  All services shall be provided in a timely manner to help ensure that CFSAN can fulfill its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents.

	Task 1

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Brucella abortus, melitensis, and suis (Brucella spp.).  These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

	The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Brucella spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

	Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp. species from food.

	Task 2

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei (Burkholderia spp).   These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Burkholderia spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp. from food.

Security Issues

	All personnel involved in the performance of this task order shall have a secret or higher security clearance.  The clearance shall be obtained prior to commencement of any work.  Performance of this task order shall be conducted in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  The manual can be accessed at the following web site:   <http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm>.  

The offeror shall provide proof of a certified BSL-3 laboratory and trained personnel for work on the project.


It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID, IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research is will be necessary to classify some of these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the necessary security clearances.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments.  The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement and proposals will be due 30 days after issue of the RFP.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contracting Officers e-mail address or fax number contained herein.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Adminstration, Terminal Business Unit =E2=80=93 = Surveillance Sector  (ATB-400) plans to procure ASR-11 Primary Surveillance=  Radar/Monopulse Secondary Surveillance (PSR/MSSR) Optimization tools, trai= ning course development, and training conduct via a  contract to TRIOS Asso= ciates Inc. of Lanham, MD. with  Regulus Group of Woodstock, VA as a subcon= tractor.  The scope of the effort encompasses development of an integrated = Radar optimization capability consisting of a software tool, a hardware pla= tform, course development for optimization training, course conduct, and ne= cessary site support for ASR-11 Radar alignment & optimization.   =20 Background:=20 The Terminal Radar Digitize, Replace, and Establish Program (TRDRE) was dev= eloped to replace aging ASR-7/8 radar systems, and associated ATCBI-4/5 bea= con systems at 100 low- to medium-density terminal facilities; establish 8 = new ASR-11 sites; provide 2 mobile and 2 support radar systems; and provide=  digital data to new automation systems such as STARS. The FAA ASR-11 program is planning to install 112 radars throughout the Uni= ted States.  Installation of these radars requires very accurate alignment = of site specific parameters to the local environment and Air Traffic needs.=   This optimization will be conducted by FAA resources within the Operation= al Support Group (AOS-230), the Terminal Business Unit (ATB-440), and FAA N= AS Implementation (ANI) organizations.  These resources will optimize each = site by optimization of system parameters to the unique site environmental = and Air Traffic needs to provide the maximum capabilities to the users, fly= ing public, and the National Airspace System. In order to meet the schedule of the rapid site deployments, the optimizati= on tools must be capable of streamlining optimization efforts on-site and s= tandardizing optimization practices.  In addition, training must be made av= ailable to facilitate deployment of the optimization teams.  In order to me= et the deployment schedule, the optimization software tools must be availab= le to FAA AOS within this fiscal year (FY 2003) for completion of baseline = optimization practice. =20 TRIOS Associates, Inc. and Regulus Group currently possess in-depth knowled= ge of the ASR-11 parameters, performance characteristics, mechanisms for op= timizing the radar, and experience in optimizing the ASR-11 to meet Air Tra= ffic needs.  TRIOS Associates Inc possesses hardware platform technology fo= r Test Target generation.  Regulus Group has delivered software tools as pa= rt of the Radar Toolbox =C2=AE currently in use by the FAA.  .  Both TRIOS = Associates Inc. and Regulus Group personnel are thoroughly familiar with th= e ASR-11 program, its intended purpose, system capabilities, the AOS operat= ional support group personnel who will receive the end product, and backgro= und knowledge in optimizing digital radar systems in the NAS for Air Traffi= c needs.  Trios Associates, Inc. and Regulus group have successfully delive= red pieces of the total optimization software tool.  The knowledge of the s= ystem, knowledge of the requirements for the intended use, and pre-existing=  optimization software and hardware tools that can interface to the radar t= oday make Regulus Group and TRIOS Associates Inc the only known source that=  can provide this tool in time to meet the first article need date of Septe= mber 2003. The FAA intends to award a contract to TRIOS Associates, Inc. in early June=  2003 unless other vendors can support their capability to delivery the ASR= -11 optimization package within the required timeframe. =20 The point of contact on this acquisition is Steve Manley, 202-267-7539.

The RSE will integrate classified and compartmented programs within the existing NACTS training and exercise programs to improve efficiency, effectiveness and synergy of operational capabilities. The Air Force has a requirement to integrate sources of mission participant information using Link-16 data from various systems including all Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) terminals and the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS LVT) variants 1, 2 and 3.

CDA has the resources to successfully accomplish NACTS RSE and is uniquely capable of performing the tasks since they developed, installed, and modified the existing training systems under the initial NACTS program.  In addition, ICADS is a proprietary product of CDA and is not available from any other source.   Information associated with this effort is unclassified, or classified up to, and including, SECRET. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Ida M.

A soil drainage mat shall cover below grade portions of the foundation and drain tile shall surround the foundation, day lighting downhill. Basement walls, doors and ceiling shall be insulated with expanded polystyrene foam completely filling module cavities. The basement floor shall be insulated with 2" of extruded polystyrene and covered with 3" of clean gravel. The interior of the foundation walls shall be covered with 1/2" ACQ treated plywood below the floor and 3/8" CDX plywood above. Interior of basement shall be painted white. BUILDING FLOORS: The building floor shall be constructed from 2"x4" joists on 12" centers with 3/4" plywood glued and nailed. The floor shall have a 1/4"/ft. slope toward the entry door and a 1-1/2" cant strip at floor-wall intersections. A polyurethane coating shall be applied according to manufacturer's directions to the floor and 6" up the side walls. Silica sand for or equivalent shall be added. BUILDING WALLS: Toilet room walls shall be framed with 2"x3" studs with 3/8" plywood glued and nailed on the inside. All interior plywood edges shall be blocked.

<DESC>There exists an immediate and ongoing need for products that empower managers and developers to acquire and field training systems that effectively transfer learning to required human performance standards. The purpose of this Acquisition Plan (AP) is to procure revision of training system acquisition process guidance products, using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQC) vehicle.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing the information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resulting solicitation for the requirement.   


I.  BACKGROUND: Training Transformation, mandated by OSD in REF A, will require the integration of training, not only across training systems, but also as an inseparable element in DODs new “system of systems” environment. As such, the Department must identify interfaces between training systems and acquisition, logistics, personnel, military education, and command and control processes, and ensure training is integrated into these processes. Interoperable net-centric training capabilities, such as embedded simulations, job-performance aids, and integrated simulators and training devices, will be elevated as priorities within the acquisition process. Acquisition processes will be modified to include training requirements as a key performance parameter or a similar forcing function construct to ensure cost-benefit trade offs inherent to the design of new military systems and equipment explicitly considering interoperable, net-centric training systems and testing. Training will be tracked in a manner similar to that of key performance parameters throughout the acquisition process. 

II. PROBLEM: The Performance Specification (REF B) and associate DIDs (REF C) do not address Human Systems Integration (HSI) and are inadequate in their treatment of human capability and performance. The guidance for acquiring and developing/providing training products/services in REF D is similarly deficient. Moreover, REFs B, C and D need to be updated to reflect best business practices, latest technology and standard industry terminology related to fielding effective human performance-oriented training. 

III. ANTICIPATED CONTRACT: NAVAIRSYSCOM has a requirement for revision of REFs B, C, and D, (and additional volumes if required) and training support in their use. NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding an indefinite quantity/delivery type contract to the selected Contractor. A single source will be selected to ensure seamless integration of best practices across the volumes. The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract over a 60-month period. Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as firm-fixed price/cost plus fixed fee delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.

 IV. RESEARCH REQUIRED: Prior to product development, market research must be conducted of best business practices concerning relevant research and emerging processes related to Instructional Systems Development (ISD)/Systems Approach to Training (SAT); incorporation of HSI factors across those processes; insertion of technology; and acquisition of effective human performance-oriented training. Of special interest is embedded training; interactive multimedia instruction; advanced distributed learning; distributed mission training; media analysis and analysis of alternative training systems (including cost-benefit); human performance measures; and verification and validation of computer-based courseware. Analysis must be conducted to evaluate the potential for application of the identified best practices within REFs B, C, and D. 

V. CAPABILITIES REQUIRED: Successful performance of this contract will require extensive knowledge of and experience with REFs B, C, and D. The ability to synthesize identified best business practices into performance specifications and guidance documentation suitable for use in Government procurements will be essential. The joint services ISD/SAT and training acquisition policies emerged out of long-term debates within the Defense Training System Working Group (DTSWG) to arrive at consensus on best practices. Accordingly, participation with the DTSWG in that deliberative process and development/revision of the documents will be weighted factors for source selection. In addition to the research requirement, the required capabilities include 1) Human Systems Integration; 2) Human Systems Engineering; 3) Training requirements front end analysis; 4) Human Performance analysis; 5) Americans with Disabilities Act compliance 6) Measurement and evaluation of training effectiveness; 7) Media Analysis of latest technology; 8) Cost-benefit analysis; 9) electronic performance support systems; 10) IMI/ADL SCORM production process; 11) Weapons and training systems acquisition; 12) Systems Engineering. 

VI. PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS: The Government will require the contractor to provide highly skilled and experienced personnel in specific disciplines to meet the professional and technical requirements listed above. 

NAVAIR Orlando anticipates awarding a Cost Plus Fixed Fee/Firm Fixed Price Independent Quantity Contract (IQC) type contract.  The Government anticipates a Not-to-Exceed $5M contract  over a 60-month period.  Detailed requirements for specific tasks will be issued as delivery orders for a task or combination of tasks under the contract.

Oral presentations will be required under the solicitation and responding offerors will be advised after the solicitation closing date of the date, time and location for their presentation. 

A "DRAFT copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) and Request for Proposal (RFP) have been posted to the NAWCTSD World Wide Web site at  http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a need to deliver the National Highway Institute’s (NHI) existing course #134057, “Transportation Asset Management.” Transportation Asset Management is a strategic approach to managing physical transportation infrastructure. The course presents issues and recommended practices for a systematic process of preserving, upgrading and operating physical assets cost effectively. It combines engineering principles with sound business practices and economic theory, and provides tools to facilitate a more organized, logical approach to decision-making. This introductory one-day training course is targeted to the executive, top and mid management levels of a state Department of Transportation.

The resulting contract will be for two years, with three 1-year options to address continuing requirements.

This is a full and open Commercial Item solicitation being conducted under FAR Part 12 procedures. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.  

For the purpose of assisting those companies interested in this new training effort, we are taking two preliminary steps. First, we will quickly post a DRAFT of key sections of the proposed RFP. This is strictly for your information, and may be altered in any way prior to the official release of the RFP. Offerors are cautioned to use this only for planning purposes, and to read the actual RFP carefully when it is released.

Secondly, we are planning to hold a preproposal conference for interested companies at the NHI offices in Ballston, Virginia on May 22nd. The conference will be lead by the Contracting Officer and the Program Manager to both provide an overview of the RFP and resulting contract, and to answer your questions. We will have representatives of our Asset Management Office in attendance to explain the program and its goals.

 Inasmuch as our space is limited, we may need to have more than one session. In order to avoid having to turn people away, you MUST preregister for the conference. We will acknowledge your registration request, provide you with the specific location and assign you a time. Anyone who just shows up without having received an acknowledgement and time assignment should expect to be turned away.

To register for the conference, send an e-mail to Bob.Prior@fhwa.dot.gov. Please state the number of people who will be attending. Again, due to limited space, please send as few as necessary to meet your needs.

We will track the questions and answers from the conference(s) and post them here on FedBizOpps for the benefit of all.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. However, interested parties can register at the aforementioned site to receive procurement announcements and notifications of postings by e-mail.

Please note that FedBizOpps has added a new feature called Interested Vendors List. Those interested in subcontracting, supplying, consulting and the like should register, and prime contractors should review the names posted there.

Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is May 23, 2003. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

ATTENTION: Minority, Women-owned, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises. The Department of Transportation, Short-Term Lending Program offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts.

<DESC>The Environmental Contracting Division (311th HSW/PKV), Brooks AFB, Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Environmental Remediation and Construction (ENRAC) program.  This is a major source selection for environmental remediation and construction at sites located on DoD (primarily Air Force) installations worldwide, as well as any other sites for which the AFCEE customers have responsibility.  Resulting contracts will provide multiple, full service technology capabilities to clean up various contaminants in environmental media (air, water, or soil); repair, maintain, construct, and operate environmental sites and facilities; and related activities.  Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR Supplements thereto.  Multiple contract awards are anticipated with a total program ceiling of $4 billion.  We anticipate awarding approximated 20 contracts.  One (1) to eight (8) contracts under small business set-aside procedures, and one (1) to three (3) under 8(a) set-aside procedures.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 with an applicable size standard of no more than 500 employees.  This size standard applies for the establishment of eligibility as a small business.  The contracts are contemplated to be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity  (IDIQ) with multiple contracting arrangements (i.e.: FFP, FPIF, CPAF, CPFF, CPIF).  For purposes of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, this effort is construed as construction.  Therefore small business concerns must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of material, with its own employees.  We anticipate releasing the RFP on or about 27 Jun 03.  The RFP will be issued via the FedBizOps and posted on the AFCEE homepage at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/werc/.  Offerors who determine that the technical requirements of this RFP require clarification (s) in order to permit submittal of a responsive proposal shall submit all questions in writing within 10 days of publication of the RFP.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Mr Michael Higgins, ASC/SY at (937)-255-9005, email address.  All proposals must be received by 4 p.m. CST, on the closing date.  This will be no less than 30 calendar days after the release of the RFP.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to check the RFP for the actual issuance and proposal due dates.  Proposals must be addressed to 311th Human Systems Wing/PKVCB, Attn: Ms. Mary Urey, 3207 North Road, Brooks AFB, TX, 78235-5363.  Responses and inquiries also may be directed to bea.delossantos@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-4419; connie.massenburg@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-2812; and diane.glass@brooks.af.mil, voice (210) 536-5523.  Please ensure emails are sent to all three POCs.

<DESC>FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure technical support to assess, plan, implement, and transfer a Change Management program.  

The following information is hereby incorporated into the Statement of Work and is in response to questions received based on the original posting: 

This initiative has been developed by the NAVSUP Command Information Officer (CIO), located in Mechanicsburg, PA, for the purpose of focusing on customer requirements and reducing overhead in all business areas.  The Change Management Team Leader will be located in Mechanicsburg with two or three team members who may be located at field Activities.  When the Change Management Team is fully formed, it is expected that there will be three to four full time members with ad hoc members brought on for certain projects.

NAVSUP desires to understand its organization's general willingness and readiness to accept change and the organization's preparedness to accept the specific changes at hand.  They are also looking to learn a "formula" that can be used to introduce future changes with a high degree of confidence that the change will be accepted.         

NAVSUP is responsible for several aspects of the change process.  Information regarding the aspects of change is provided for these specific areas: 1) Dealing with customers - the cornerstone of this aspect is the formation of seven Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS) positions aligned to directly support the major customer business areas; 2) Changing Major Functions - the four major functional areas involved with this change are: Inventory Management, Information Technology, Financial Management, and Contracting; 3) Reduction of Infrastructure - business process improvements in the four functional areas of major impact will result in a substantial reduction of infrastructure; 4) Changing Business Processes - cost reduction in the four major business areas will result from significant business process changes; 5) Changing Service Delivery Models - the premise of transformation within NAVSUP calls for the provision of acceptable service levels at reduced costs; 6) Changing Organizational Alignment - the change in alignment is to match ACOSs to customers; 7) Changing Tools used to Perform Daily Tasks - existing software tools are being replaced (at various times) by an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) tool, programs needed to supplement the ERP, a Navy Enterprise Portal (NEP), Web Services, new forms of data exchange tools, and the modification of existing systems to operate in the realigned environment.

Currently, NAVSUP uses Primavera as a Project Management tool and follows the Project Management techniques as taught by ESI International and George Washington University.  However, it is anticipated that, at the outset, the Change Management team will possess minimal experience with formal change management tools, methodologies, or execution.

The contractor will assist in building a change management plan for the immediate transformation changes and to assist in, at a minimum, the initial phases of implementing these changes.  The contractor should also be capable of transferring (teaching) those skills to fulltime NAVSUP employees so that they can do effective change management for themselves in the future.

The contractor’s assessment should address the risk of not implementing a formalized change management plan and applying it to the immediate transformation changes that NAVSUP is facing.  This is based on the successful development and implementation of the change management plan. 

The Contractor should demonstrate the ability to provide sufficient services to make Change Management a standard business practice throughout the NAVSUP Claimancy, which consists of approximately 24,000 military and civilian personnel worldwide.  

With regard to travel, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Mechanicsburg, PA.  This will allow the contractor to work with the NAVSUP Change Team with the purpose of "transferring" knowledge.  An initial "fact finding" visit to each Enterprise location will be required near the beginning of the project and a follow-on "implementation assist" visit will be required near the end of the project.

With respect to the deliverables, the Project Charter should be developed before the Project Plan.

Quotes shall be received in the bid room at FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, Bldg. 2B, 700 Robbins Ave., Philadelphia, PA 19111 no later than 2:00 PM (local time) on 04 June 2003.  Responses may be e-mailed to Mike Capilato at (PLEASE NOTE THE CORRECT E-MAIL ADDRESS): michael.capilato@navy.mil, provided the response is received by the time and date established above.  For additional information concerning this requirement, please contact Mike Capilato, Code 02P21D, at (215) 697-9647.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), National Water and Climate Center (NWCC), located in Portland, OR, operates two unique hydroclimatic data collection systems.  One of the systems known as the Snowpack Telemetry (SNOTEL) provides near real-time precipitation, air pemperature and snowpack information to forecast stream flow volumes.  The NWCC is seeking sources for pressure transducers to be used for it SNOWTEL system.  Prospective Bidders will be required to sale two transducers of each sizes, a total of 10 units to be used as test examples to NWCC in order to qualify as a possible vendor.  The tests would include 1) cold testing to the specified temperture, and all other specifications as outlined in our specification sheeet, 2) prospective bidders are to provide the testing units within  8 weeks of placing an order , 3) one week to test units, then, placed on self for 3 weeks to test for short term drift.  If all units submitted by a vendor pass this 4 weeks testing, then the units will be conditionally qualified and the NWCC would purchase a limited amount of units to be placed in the field.  After 6 months of in-th-field testing, the vendors would be fully qualified and the NWCC would begin purchasing the units at a rate of approximately 100 per year.  It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract will be issued to the successful vendor.  The specifications for the pressure transducer are included to this posting.  Vendors are required to submit their transducers and specifications to our testing center in Portland, OR, to the attention of Ronald Bush, technical contact (see attachment for instructions and specifications).  Request for electronic copy of specifications can be obtained by e-mailing: jlowe@ftw.nrcs.usda.gov.  Interesting vendors should contact James Lowe, Contracting Officer, by close of business on Auguse 15, 2002, 4:30 PM to arrange for purchasing the 10 units for initial testing phase.  These standards and specification apply to those applications of conversion of snow water equivalent, precipitation, or other liquid level quantities to electrical voltage.  The purpose is to convert liquid pressure of snow, rain, etc., to an electrical output.  Transducers are used in conjunction with precipitation gages, snow pillows, stream level gages, or other similar sensors which require measurement of the height (pressure) of a hydraulic head, and conversion of that value to an electronic signal for recording or telemetry.  Specifications:  1) Pressure range shall be 0-50 inches, 0-100 inches, 0-150 inches, 0-200 inches, or 0-250 inches of water, gage pressure, 2) Construction is to be of rugged, noncorroding material.  Wetted numbers and electronic sections used shall not be affected by methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, mineral oil, water, or mixture thereof, 3) Shall be capable of operating under conditions of: 100 percent relative humidity, condensing.  Up to 150 percent overpressure with less than 0.5 percent shift in calibration, 4) Shall be equipped with 1/8 inch NPT (F) fitting, 5) Static error band + or - percent full scall output at 75 degrees (F).  This band includes the effects of nonlinearity, hysteresis, and nonrepeatability, and is expressed as a percentage of full scale output voltage, 6)  Random drift at a constant pressure shall be: less than 0.2 percent/month, full scale less than 0.5 percent/6 months, full scale, 7) Temperature sesitivity: Operating temperature range -40 degrees (F) to +130 degrees (F), 8) Temperature compensation: Temperature drift not to exceed + or -  1.3 percent full scale output at 100 degrees (F) and -20 degrees (F) with 75 degrees (F) as the reference point, 9)   Output shall be stabilized to 99.9 percent of it's final nominal output voltage at any pressure, within 80 millisecond after application of excitation voltage, with no warm-up drift, 10) Output signal shall be analog with a range of 0-5 Vdc, 11) Output voltage ripple shall not exceed .025 vac (RMS), 12) Excitation voltage shall be a minimum of 10 Vdc, 13) The electrical connection to the transducer shall be a three or four wire shielded cable, length to be specified in the purchase order with 10 feet being normal, 14) The pressure chamber shall have an air bleeder port which will allow purging of any air extrained or trapped in the wetted area, 15) Any special installation instructions shall be furnished by the manufacturer such as recommended mounting attitude, proper method of voiding the pressure chamber of air, etc., and 16) Each transducer shall be tested by the namufacturer through it's full range and at representative temperatures throughout the compensated range when cold soaked to those temperatures.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)

Geospatial Business Partners 


1.0 Introduction 

The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is considering establishing non-contractual business partnerships with commercial firms capable of online or media delivery of NRCS geospatial and imagery data to Technical Service Providers (TSPs).  In addition, the business partners may arrange to provide additional geospatial technology services to TSPs.  This Request for Information (RFI) is a request for interested parties to provide written responses describing their capabilities, resources and interests to fulfill this need. The NRCS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for information received in response to this RFI.  The RFI is issued for NRCS information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  

2.0  Background 

The 2002 Farm Bill authorized USDA to utilize certified Technical Service Providers (TSPs) to provide conservation technical assistance to landowners on behalf of USDA.  In addition, the 2002 Farm Bill represents the single most significant commitment of resources toward conservation on private lands in the nation’s history.  As a result, the demand for technical assistance to do conservation work is expected to increase and exceed the current staffing capacity of the NRCS.   Types of technical assistance services provided by TSPs may include but are not limited to conservation planning and design, layout, installation, and checkout of installed conservation practices.  Work performed by TSPs must meet NRCS standards and specifications, program requirements, and relevant laws and regulations.   TSPs will provide technical services to private landowners, farmers, ranchers and producers who participate in USDA conservation programs.   TSPs will complement the work currently being done by NRCS conservationists at the local level.  

As of May 1, 2003, approximately 380 TSPs are certified and over 400 are pending certification.  About 35 businesses and entities are certified and about 100 are pending certification.    The NRCS has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with organizations having TSP certification programs with membership over 10,000.  

3.0  Need For Geospatial Data and Technology Services

NRCS conservationists are continually increasing their use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and automated tools to more efficiently develop, manage and monitor planned and installed conservation practices.  The NRCS believes TSPs will also use the same GIS and geospatial technologies to plan and install conservation practices and/or request these geospatial services from a second party.   

The NRCS makes geospatial data available to the general pubic via the Resource Data Gateway (RDG).  The NRCS will continue to make NRCS authoritative geospatial data available to the general pubic via the RDG.   NRCS authoritative data is only available to the general public in the data’s native format.  NRCS does not integrate, customize or manipulate NRCS authoritative data for the general public.  Most data obtained by the public is downloaded from the RDG.

The NRCS plans to limit the delivery of geospatial data obtained from external sources (e.g. other federal agencies) to the general public via the RDG.  NRCS will direct general public requests for external data to the appropriate authoritative source and/or Geospatial Business Partners.  The NRCS will continue to make both authoritative and external data available to NRCS and other USDA internal users through the RDG.  

The TSPs will require access to geospatial data and GIS support services to accomplish their tasks.  The TSPs increased demand for geospatial data will exceed NRCS’ capability and impact our internal RDG delivery system.  The Geospatial Business Partners are expected to alleviate these demands on NRCS.    NRCS cannot provide an estimated number of TSPs that will require geospatial data and services nor can we predict the volume of services at this time.

4.0  Role of Geospatial Business Partners.

We envision the role of the Geospatial Business Partners would be to provide geospatial data and geospatial technology services to TSPs.  Compensation for these services would be negotiated between the TSPs and Geospatial Business Partners through either a charge per transaction or a subscription based pricing model.  Examples of the types of services and products that the Geospatial Business Partners would likely provide to TSPs are listed below: 

-	Provide geospatial data in either digital or hard-copy format.
-	Create/digitize new geospatial data sets for GIS use.
-	Add value or enhance existing geospatial data sets for GIS use.        
-    Integrate and/or convert geodata to GIS ready format.
-	Perform GIS analysis services.   
- 	Package and customize geospatial data and information for TSP and landowner use.
-	Provide tools like Customer Service Toolkit (CST) for TSP use.  
-	Provide total mapping and GIS functional support.
-	Obtain datasets from other sources (private, local government, federal government, etc) integrate and 	deliver to TSPs or use to provide GIS analysis services. 
-	Host geospatial data and provide full service integration, e.g. managing geospatial and tabular data.
-	Provide subscription services to NRCS authoritative data such as soils and digital orthoimagery and 	other geospatial data.
-	Customize data sets for specific locations and needs
-	Host on-line data servers and provide online spatial and mapping services for access by TSPs.
-	Provide custom integration of different geospatial datasets to facilitate TSP use in a GIS. 
-	Provide access, training, and support for use of automated conservation planning tools such as the 	Customer Service Toolkit, GIS, GPS, etc.   


5.0  NRCS Relationship With Geospatial Business Partners.

The NRCS would agree to provide the following to the Geospatial Business Partners:

-	Provide online access to NRCS authoritative geospatial data. 
-	Reduce the cost for large purchases of NRCS authoritative geospatial data.   
-	Notify Business Partners of updates to NRCS authoritative geospatial data.
-	Give priority to Geospatial Business Partners requests for new or enhanced authoritative data.
-	Publicize Geospatial Business Partners from NRCS web sites.
-	Refer TSPs to Geospatial Business Partners.
-	Provide technical information on the use and management of NRCS geospatial data.


6.0  Geospatial Data Needs

Below are the primary and typical types of geospatial data that will be required by TSPs.  Typically, the data needs to be detailed and of resolution for use at farm and ranch land parcels.  

a) NRCS Authoritative Geospatial Data:

	-  Soils   –  SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic Database) and STATSGO (State Soil Survey 			    Geographic Database).

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with H.T. Harvey & Associates for the NW Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).  Purpose of proposed contract is to conduct and report on analyses of sea bird data collected from strip transects conducted in 2000 and 2002.  NWFSC conducted strip-transect surveys of seabirds on four cruises in conjunction with other components of GLOBEC-NEP.  These sets of cruises included mesoscale and fine scale synoptic grids in June and August between Newport, OR and Eureka, CA extending 150 km offshore.  NWFSC has amassed several hundred kilometers of strip transect data for each of the four cruises.  Proposed work builds on work completed by proposed contractor during 2000 and 2002.  No other source is capable of performing the required work.  Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Randall Brown at 206-526-6226.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $100,000.

<SUBJECT>U -- Training Services
<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to amend the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) issued to:  QQQ Software, Inc., 302 North Irving Street, Arlington, VA  22201 to increase the maximum amount from $25,000 to $50,000.  The vendor is to provide Information Technology (IT) on site training as listed.  Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  --  TPL Tables for Windows Introduction:  
This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need to understand the process of creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  TPL TABLES is a general-purpose cross-tabulation software package.  It is based on the BLS-developed mainframe TPL system. TPL TABLES has been commercially available since 1987.  It is used at government agencies, private companies, associations, and universities around the world.  TPL TABLES is used to summarize data and present the results in a tabular form.  Its tabulation engine is fast and efficient.  The output produced by TPL TABLES is considered publication-quality.  This course will teach the participants how to use the MS-DOS editor or the Windows editor to create the text files used in TPL TABLES jobs, how to write the data description file (codebook file) needed to create tables, how to design table request files that specify the structure of the table output, and how to write format request files to produce the publication ready table formats.

  --  TPL Tables for Windows Intermediate:  
 This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need advanced knowledge for creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing, analyzing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  This course will briefly review the material taught in Introduction to TPL TABLES for the PC and cover more advanced topics, including generating statistics, sophisticated table design, and complete table formatting.  

  --  TPL-SQL for ODBC:  
This is a two-day, hands-on course.  The TPL-SQL database interface gives you direct database access from TPL Tables.  It eliminates the need for you to first extract the data from the database before creating tables.  You do not need to know SQL commands, because TPL Tables automatically generates the required commands and extracts only the data it needs.  TPL-SQL works via ODBC to access databases for which you have ODBC drivers.  Some examples are SAS, Sybase, MS Access and SQL Server.  The TPL Codebook Builder makes use of the data descriptions stored in the database to help you build a TPL codebook (data description) interactively.  

The vendor will develop and deliver training services for the BLS as follows:  
  --  Developing and providing classroom training and seminars in courses in the BLS IT training curricula, emerging technologies, software management, and other important IT-related topics; 
  --  Developing and delivering superior course content; 
  --  Providing a BLS on-site library of current course materials; descriptions, outlines and prerequisites; 
  --  Ensuring that course materials reflect current BLS standards.  

The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.  The training is to provide participants with new capabilities to significantly improve the way complex systems are analyzed, designed, developed, and implemented.  

This notice of intent is not a request for offers.  There is no RFP notice.  This posting is for information purposes only.

<SUBJECT>JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3
<DESC>The JTRS-M/F Program Office will hold Industry Day #3 at the MITRE McLean, VA facility on 18-20 June 2003.  Specifics are provided in following paragraphs; a map the location is attached.  The following provides some key data. 1.  JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 GENERAL SESSION.  The General Session will take place on 18 June 2003 in the MITRE McLean, VA facility, Wilson building (street address:  7600 Old Springhouse Road, McLean, VA 22102), Room 1B02. The meeting will start at 0800 EDT.  The proposed agenda for this conference is 0800-0925 Program Office Status   CDR Miguel San Pedro 0930-1025 RFP Preview    Brad Hoisington 1030-1155 Networking    Howard Pace 1200-1255 Lunch 1300-1425 Air Force Requirements   Don Wilkenson (TBD) 1430-1600 JTRS Management Environment David Bedard 1600-1630 Wrap up    CDR Miguel San Pedro Any company that wishes to participate in this General Session must convey its interest to Mark Lopez, the JTRS-M/F Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO), by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 11 June 2003.  Participation in the JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 General Session is limited to five (5) representatives per Corporation.  Attendees are requested to provide their name, company represented, and citizenship. 2.  JTRS-M/F INDUSTRY DAY #3 ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  Scheduled One-On-One sessions will take place on 19-20 June 2003 in the MITRE McLean, VA facility, MITRE-2 building (street address:  7515 Colshire Drive, McLean, VA 22102-7508), Room 2N103. Prime System Level potential offerors will be afforded a 90-minute period of time to meet one-on-one with the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  During this 90-minute period, Prime System Level potential offerors may present both their possible solution to the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the JTRS-M/F System Specification) and questions or concerns to the Program Office.  The Program Office will attempt to address those questions and concerns, and may present its own questions to the potential offerors. 3.  USE OF NON-GOVERNMENT EXPERTS DURING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office utilizes non-government specialists for expert technical and programmatic support.  The program office desires that these specialists participate in the potential offerors? one-on-one sessions with the Government.  These specialists are employed by the following corporations:  Booz Allen Hamilton  DCS  GRD  INDUS Technology, Inc.  Maxim Systems, Inc.  Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC  Scientific Research Corporation, SRC  Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI  These corporations have filed with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate (Code 02) a letter indicating their intention to neither compete for the JTRS-M/F contract as a prime contractor, nor subcontract with or advise any vendor that may compete for the JTRS-M/F contract.  Employees of the above corporations who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office have also filed Non-Disclosure Agreements with the SPAWAR Contracts Directorate that restrict those employees from releasing any information received from potential offerors to anyone outside of the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  In addition to these corporations, MITRE Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Corporation, also supports the JTRS-M/F Program Office.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office is in the process of obtaining a No Compete Letter from MITRE, but at the time of the release of this announcement, this letter has not been received.  MITRE personnel who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements.  Because the participating Prime System Level potential offerors are likely to provide proprietary information during the one-on-one meetings, the JTRS-M/F Program Office needs those offerors to submit to the JTRS-M/F PCO a statement on company letterhead indicating permission for JTRS-M/F program support contractors identified above to participate in the offerors? one-on-one presentations.  As an example, the Government requests that this Letter of Permission includes a statement such as ?(Insert Offeror name) permits employees of Booz Allen Hamilton DCS GRD INDUS Technology, Inc. Maxim Systems, Inc. MITRE Corporation Science Applications International Corporation, SAIC Scientific Research Corporation, SRC Tele-Consultants Incorporated, TCI who support the JTRS-M/F Program Office, to have access to any of  (Insert Offeror?s name)?s proprietary information that (Insert Offeror?s name) may present during its JTRS-M/F Industry Day #3 one-on-one presentation.?  The Government requests delivery of this letter by no later than 1600 EDT on 11 June 2003 to the following address: Commander, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, 4301 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92110-3127, Attn: Mark Lopez, Code 02-33.  Alternatively, the offeror can submit this statement electronically to mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> by 1600 EDT on 11 June 2003.  The Government also requests that if a participating Prime System Level potential offeror objects to any of the above identified contractors attending its one-on-one presentation, the offeror make its objection to Mark Lopez by letter or email at the above addresses no later than 1600 EDT on 11 June 2003. 4.  SCHEDULING ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS.  The JTRS-M/F Program Office will make every effort to meet with all interested Prime System Level potential offeror?s; however, the number of one-on-one presentations that can be scheduled on 19-20 June 2003 is limited.  Consequently, scheduling of the one-on-one sessions during these days will be prioritized by the following guidance (in order of decreasing preference): (1) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to the two previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements (February 2003 and March 2003). (2) Prime System Level potential offerors who submitted written responses to one but not both of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements. (3) Prime System Level potential offerors who did not respond to either of the previously released JTRS-M/F CBD announcements, but wish to present their possible solution for the Cluster 3 system (in accordance with the previously released CBD announcements).  If, due to time constraints during 19-20 June 2003, the Government is unable to schedule a one-on-one session with a Prime System Level potential offeror that responds to this announcement, the Government will schedule a one-on-one meeting with that potential offeror at a future date at both parties earliest convenience.  Prime System Level potential offerors that are scheduled for one-on-one meetings during 19-20 June 2003 can invite to the meetings representatives from those corporations that comprise their potential JTRS-M/F teams.  Vendor interest in scheduling a one-on-one session must be conveyed to Mark Lopez, by e-mail at mark.lopez@navy.mil <mailto:mark.lopez@navy.mil> or by commercial telephone (619) 524-7168 by 1600 EDT on 11 June 2003.  By 1600 EDT on 11 June, the JTRS-M/F Program Office will contact each vendor by email indicating the scheduled time for the Prime System Level potential offeror?s one-on-one session. 5.  ACCESS TO MITRE facilities.  The Cluster 3 Industry Day meetings will be UNCLASSIFIED.  Consequently, MITRE does not require a Visit Request memorandum from any participants.  However, badges will be needed for access throughout the MITRE facilities.  All corporations are required to contact Ms. Jeannette Gerke (jgerke@mitre.org, 703-883-7493) and provide a list of participants. 6.  PARKING.  Parking is as shown on the attached maps to the Wilson and MITRE-2 buildings. 7.  LOCAL ACCOMODATIONS:  The attached file lists hotels located near the MITRE McLean, VA facility. 8.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated release date of the official JTRS-M/F Cluster 3 Request for Proposals is in the summer 2003, with contract award anticipated for first quarter calendar year 2004.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this announcement or at Industry Day and submittals will not be returned to the sender.

<OFFADD>Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service, National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA, 22161
<SUBJECT>T -- Multi Media Services
<DESC>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency at the Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, is authorized to enter into joint ventures pursuant to Section 3704b(a)(1)(A) of Title 15 of the United States Code.  NTIS is looking for a joint venture partner with whom it can establish a framework for digitizing and managing federally produced audio-visual, multimedia and training collections/assets.  Once digitized, collections must be made searchable with enhanced features, such as visual and textual search capabilities and must be offered to the general public in various formats.  Revenue will be derived either from the sale of such materials directly to the public or from digitizing and asset management services to be offered to other federal agencies.

Currently, NTIS has approximately 6,000 masters in its collection in various formats, including digital BCSP video, BCSP video, 1 inch video, 3 /4 inch video, VHS video, video discs, CD-ROM, diskettes, 35mm slides, audiocassettes, and electronic and hard copy texts.

This space must be controlled for air temperature and humidity; 2) coordinate and execute the transfer of materials, at its expense, from the Washington, DC metro area locations that NTIS identifies.  This transfer includes all current and incoming audio-visual, multimedia and training mastering materials and existing stock in NTIS’ National Audiovisual Center (NAC) collection.  Masters and existing stock previously stored in approximately 600 square feet of space.  The partner will provide a schedule that will be negotiated before any of the collection is transferred.  The partners agree that all mastering materials and elements provided or created will remain the property of the United States Government and may not be disposed of or destroyed without prior NTIS written consent; 3) digitize mastering materials, at its expense, making them searchable, viewable and web-enabled.  The media may be produced in various formats such as videocassette, audiocassette, CD-ROM, diskette, 35mm slide, PowerPoint slide/overheads, DVD, text, multimedia training packages or other formats as the parties may agree upon.  Some of the other formats include digitizing, logging and indexing media content; providing analog and digital recording and playback devices for capturing images and sound to disk and other formats, and providing hardware and software to digitize, index, catalogue, retrieve and review video clips (i.e., providing search capability) through a web browser; 4) return all masters to either NTIS or the source agency that produced the product; 5) retain control of the digitized master unless instructed otherwise by NTIS; and 6) reproduce and disseminate NTIS/NAC public sale orders on an on-demand basis.

The partners will negotiate an agreement by which they will share the revenue from the sales of products to the public or digitizing/asset management services to federal agencies on a monthly basis as described above.  Revenues from these services will be determined based on the nature of the service and the work that will be performed by each party.

NTIS and the partner will jointly determine all prices for the sale of new products covered by this Agreement based on a mutually agreeable formula and consultation on any items that are outside the formula.  NTIS will accept and process sales orders and refer them to the partner for fulfillment in the format requested by the customer.  To facilitate this, NTIS will develop an automated interface to link NTIS and the partner.  Upon order fulfillment, the partner will provide NTIS with confirmation via the interface.  The partner will replace, at its own expense, any product that is unusable, broken, incomplete or that otherwise fails to operate properly.

NTIS proposes the joint venture to remain in place for a period of five (5) years unless the parties agree to renew the agreement.

Presentations may be made at the request of NTIS.  Any such presentation must cover all aspects of this RFI.

A revenue sharing agreement will be a result of this partnership to provide returns to the successful party.  Anticipated revenue streams must be addressed in the response.  The solution provided by the partner(s) will enable the partnership to provide a customized integrated solution to NTIS for use by federal agencies.

NTIS will evaluate responses based on criteria listed above. Prospective partners are required to describe and reference the technical capabilities of their services, describe their technical expertise and provide a concise description of their experience and ability to provide these services to NTIS and other government agencies.

NTIS has for more than fifty years fulfilled its mission of acquiring and disseminating information obtained from both government and private sector sources worldwide in response to the needs of government agencies, and the general public.  NTIS is also responsible for implementing new methods or media for disseminating information, including producing and disseminating information products in electronic format.

NTIS operates a clearinghouse for the information it collects, delivering bibliographic databases, and content selected by consumers in paper and electronic format, and also supports the fulfillment needs of users for the delivery of historic or archived materials produced in print-on-demand paper, demand microform or CD-ROM, or via on-line electronic access.  If you have any questions about these activities, please send them via email to jplott@ntis.gov AND jhendrickson@ntis.gov, or by facsimile to (703) 605-6888.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under Simple Acquisition Procedures, a purchase order to Carmichael, Bradsher, Tuvell & Savage, 1647 Mt. Vernon Road, Atlanta, GA 30388. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Contracting Officer is reviewing the Novation request from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of South Carolina (Palmetto GBA). The Contracting Officer asked the Division of Finance Oversight (DFO) if all Administrative Cost issues have been resolved with Palmetto GBA. A Risk Assessment Review had been started by the Atlantic Regional Office (RO) for the period FY 1993-1997, but was not completed and the Risk Assessment Report was not written. The Atlanta Regional Office (RO) does not have sufficient documentation from the Risk Assessment Report to close Administrative costs from the period for the Part A and Part B contracts. The DFO and the Atlantic RO decided that an audit firm familiar with Palmetto GBA?s accounting system would be able to perform an Administrative Cost audit with an accelerated period of performance. Carmichael, Brasher, Tuvell & Company has just completed field work and issued the FY 1998-2001 final audit of the Administrative costs of Palmetto GBA for Part A and to the DFO for approval. The DFO requests that the contract for the FY 1993-1997 audit of the Administrative cost of Palmetto GBA for Part A and Part B be awarded to Carmichael, Brasher, Tuvell & Company. Their experience in the recent FY 1998-2001 Administrative cost audit of Palmetto GBA for Part A & B will enable them to complete the audit an accelerated period of performance.

<SUBJECT>--DACA31-00-D-0052, Indefinite Delivery Master Planning Contract for the Baltimore District. Intent to increase the dollar amount of the contract, extend the contract term, and combine contract periods.
<DESC>NA The Government intends to raise the dollar threshold, extend the contract term 6 months and combine contract periods under contract DACA31-00-D-0052. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery-master planning contract advertised in the Commerce Business Daily 3 February 2000, for the Baltimore District Army Corps of Engineers. The contract was awarded to STV, Inc. 7125 Ambassador Road, Baltimore, MD 21244, for one base period of $1,000,000 and two option periods of $1,000,000 each. Under this contract, the majo rity of the delivery orders issued under this contract have been in support of Fort Detrick, MD.  The end of FY03 is expected to require a number of installation master planning efforts, which will include multiple delivery orders for project documentation , planning charettes, and DD 1391 forms. Because of the AEs experience and the customers desire to continue working with this AE, services from any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be re covered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Therefore, the Baltimore District is intending to issue a modification to the contract to increase the total contract values from $3,000,000 for a total value of $3, 500,000, extend the term of the contract 6 months, and combine contract periods into one period.  The contractor completing this work will have to assume full liability for the previously completed projects within budget and schedule, and satisfy the effor t of this project, the Installation, and the User.  Interested parties should submit requests not later than 13 June 2003. Contact is Susan Sonenthal, susan.j.sonenthal@usace.army.mil, 410-962-7646. This is not a request for proposal.

This solicitation is being issued unrestricted as Request for Quotation No. 2003-Q-00861.   The NAICS is 541380 with a size standard of $6 million.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.   The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Division of Respiratory Disease Studies, Field Studies Branch in Morgantown, WV has a requirement for endotoxin assay of air samples and bulk dust samples in support of the NORA Indoor Environmental Quality project.  All air and dust samples were from Office building environment by collecting building air and by vacuuming floor and chair, respectively.     Provide the following Contract Line Items:  CLIN 001, Endotoxin Analyses for Air/Bulk Dust Samples (FY 03), 1500 EACH;  CLIN 002, Endotoxin Analyses for Air/Bulk Dust Samples (Option 1), 1500 EACH, (FY 04);  CLIN 003, Endotoxin Analyses for Air/Bulk Dust Samples (Option 2), 1500 EACH (FY 05).  NOTE:  The exercise of options is dependent upon both research and funding priorities.   SPECIFICATIONS REQUIRED:   1)  All endotoxin samples should be assayed with Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL). The coefficient of variation for the assay method should be <15%;  2)  The assay method must use pyrogen-free water, rocking for an hour at room temperature, and centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 minutes at 4ºC  for extracting endotoxin from filters, dust, and other bulk samples;  3)  The assay method must use supernatant fluid from rocked and centrifuged solution for extraction of endotoxin;  4)  The assay must be done immediately after extracting endotoxin from samples; never freeze the extracts by storing them at -85ºC;  5)  Endotoxin assay result must be reported in EU/m3 or EU/mg dust.  The endotoxin unit (EU) should be relative to RSE (reference standard endotoxin), and the potency of the RSE used must be provided.  If CSE (control standard endotoxin) is used for the assay, the potency of CSE relative to RSE, and lot number and manufacturer of CSE must be provided;  6)  NIOSH will send 0.8&#61472;&#61549;m PVC air filters and about 20 to 50 mg of dust per sample for assay.  The contracting laboratory must specify both the sufficient and the minimum (less than ideal) dust masses required for the analyses since NIOSH has limited dust mass for some samples and may supply some samples at the minimum dust mass level.  Therefore, the laboratory should also outline the disadvantages to using the minimum dust mass;  and   7)  The data must be furnished to NIOSH in hard copies as well as an electronic database (MS Access, Excel, and tab-delimited text files for database; MS word file format for documents). There should be a clear explanation of the variables included in the report.  Quality control measures for data entry, such as double-entry or validation of entered data should be demonstrated in the proposal.  DELIVERABLES:   1)  The data must be furnished to NIOSH in hard copies as well as an electronic form (MS Access, Excel, and tab-delimited text for database; MS word file format for documents). There should be a clear explanation of the variables included in the report;   2)   All detailed analytical procedures with the sample results should be provided to NIOSH;   3)  In the results, limit of detection and limit of quantification should be specified;   4)  The results of repeated sample analysis (reproducibility data, n>=10) of same extract should be reported as a coefficient of variation (CV) for each batch of sample results;   5)  The results for laboratory blank filter sample analysis and standard curve data should be provided;  and    6)   The raw data (EU/ml extract) before conversion to the final reporting units (EU/m3, or EU/mg dust) should be also provided in the results.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:   1)   The contractor shall complete analyses and deliver data on the initial batch of 300 samples within 45 days after receipt of the samples;  2)  After NIOSH research scientists evaluate the results of the initial analyses and agree to continue, a second batch (n=300) and then third, fourth etc. batch (n=300) of samples may be forwarded for analysis.  The contractor shall have 45 days from the date of receipt of each additional batch of samples to deliver the results of the analyses.  If the government decides not to proceed with any of the additional batches due to unsatisfactory assay results, those batches will be deleted from the contract without further obligation on the part of the contractor.  Partial payments shall be made in 300 sample increments.  If all options are exercised, the period of performance could span three years.   PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EVALUATION CONSIDERATION:   A technical discussion shall be presented in as much detail as practical to address the following evaluation criteria:  1)  The offeror laboratory must demonstrate experience in performing LAL assay.  For example, experience can be demonstrated with participation in large studies in the published literature or with documentation of high throughout in the laboratory;   2)  The offeror should provide qualifications of any key laboratory personnel that would be involved with this project, and perform LAL assays;  3)  A detailed extraction and analyses protocol must be specified in the proposal submitted to NIOSH The protocol should include data or information for a) the limit of detection (sensitivity), b) the limit of quantification, c) specificity, and d) reproducibility of the assay method;   4)  A proposal should provide coefficient of variation (CV) for the repeated analysis from the same extract;   5)  The offeror laboratory must provide the methods to check interferences in assaying samples in the submitted protocol;   6)   Offeror laboratory shall describe in detail quality control procedures;  7)   Data entry quality control measures, such as double-entry for data verification, should be demonstrated in the proposal;  8)  NIOSH has limited dust mass for some samples and may supply some samples at the minimum dust mass level.  The offeror laboratory should state how different sample mass would affect the result of analysis;  9)  In the proposal, the contracting laboratory must specify how samples are stored and handled after receipt in their laboratory (e.g. data logging, storage container, storage condition such as temperature, relative humidity, and other environmental parameters, and detailed sample handling procedure etc.) and   10)  Any exceptions to the specifications, deliverables or delivery schedule shall be clearly identified in the proposal.  If offeror cannot meet the desired turnaround time for each batch of samples (45 days/300 samples), an alternative time line shall be provided in the proposal, with a justification for the proposed change.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number N68836-03-T-0192 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the lastest Federal Acquisition Circular.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, NAICS 333315.  The Trident Refit Facility, Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay Ga 31547 requires: 2 each Duplex Document Scanners (suggested model Canon DR-3080C); 2 each OTG Applicatin Xtender Single User w/Scanextender; 2 each Scan Station/Image Server, Pentium 4, 2.53GHZ, 384MB Ram, 80GB HD, CD-R Recorder, 20/40GB Tape System w/11 each Tape Media, 17" Flat CRT Color Monitor, Windows XP PRO; 2 each Professional Services to include Application Design, Implementation, Installation, On-Site Training, Customized Procedures and Manuals; 2 each One Year Standard Service Agreement on equipment;
STATEMENT OF WORK:
The Trident Refit Facility (TRIREFFAC) is a Department of The Navy (DON), Intermediate Repair Facility in support of the fast overhaul and turnaround of Ohio Class Trident Nuclear Submarines.  Servicing the Trident Submarines, being nuclear in nature, presents unique data storage and retrieval requirements that include recording and storing a variety of sensitive documents and special work orders. In many cases this data is maintained for the life of the submarine (appx. 50 years) and should be able to be reproduce on demand.  The reproduced documents must be of high quality and meet all legal specification for signature authenticity. 
TRF currently uses a Canonfile 510 system to scans and index the target document.   The Canonfile 510 system stores the images and indexes the information onto a double-sided 502 MB magneto optical (MO) disk.  This process continues until both sides of the MO are full.  Each side of the MO disk is then transferred to the local hard drive.  This process uses a DOS based downloader program "Albase" to accomplish this task.  This process takes approximately 2 hours per disk to complete.   The converted information is transferred from the hard drive to CD ROM.  Two CD ROMs are generated for back up purposes.  CD ROM index information is transferred to the 16 bit Albase application and made available for retrieval.  The 502 MB MO disk is then formatted and the process starts over again from the beginning.  This entire process is repeated over and over again and has become the standard way of storing images.
Retrieval of documents is accomplished by using the 16 bit Albase application.  After a document search has been executed, the end user is prompted to insert the appropriate CD ROM containing the information.  The current information is stored on a combination of 502 MB MO disk and Albase CD ROM. 
TRF Code 420 records, processes and files approximately 3,000, two sided pages, per day, when recording.  Several different types of records/documents are processed, they are: 1. Refit Records, 2. Material Records, 3. Triper Records, 4. Supervisor Records, 5. End-Of-Refit letters and 6. Transfer Log Records.  Each of these records has it's own unique indexing structure and are subject to the same index and storage process as explained above.  These records are retained for the life of the boat, which equates to approximately 50 years.
The current Canonfile Document Imaging System's scanning, indexing and storage process is cumbersome, inefficient and no longer supported by the vendor.  This outdated system relies on 16 bit technology and will not operate under the newer 32 bit environment.  The existing 502 MB MO disks are no longer available.  The current system is incapable of growth or expansion.  The hardware components are no longer manufactured and when spare parts are exhausted this system will remain inoperable.
TRF needs to upgrade the existing file imaging system to a more modern, state-of-the-art, document imaging system that employs open-system architecture commonly used in industry.  This system should provide at a minimum all of the features currently provided by the existing system listed above.  In addition the new system should be expandable to a fully networked solution that utilizes networking technology commonly used in industry that includes but not limited to Token-Ring 16 MBPS and Ethernet 100 MBPS LAN interface.
Proposed Solution:
Provide a modern, state-of-the-art, File Imaging System that employees open system architecture, which is widely acceptable in industry.  All components proposed should be readily available, off-the-shelf and commonly used in industry.  All hardware and software should be transportable and interface with like systems.
This system should be easily upgraded to a fully networked LAN version.  All associated software and hardware should be compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows NT operating systems.  The system should have the ability to interface with either/or Token-Ring and Ethernet LANs. The system should meet all of the storage and retrieval requirements listed above.
The file imaging system should have a fully automated backup capability.  The system needs to be easy to use and efficient.  The system needs to provide fast and accurate indexing that allows personnel to efficiently pinpoint documents within the file.  The system should allow the user to intelligently organize, index and store any type of data file in the user-defined applications, enable quick and easy retrieval of mission critical data.  Also, provide an advanced graphical user interface that makes it easy to capture, display, index, store, retrieve, route and process documents and other data files.
The system should provide storage management software that will automatically and intelligently manage data and image storage and retention.  Provide fast backup and data protection.  Provide efficient access to critical data from the workstations.
The high speed document scanner should be a desktop version that can scan up to 11 in. x 17 in. size, double-sided documents on a single feed duplex read (one-pass/two sided scanning).  Provide a 100 sheet auto feeder for 8.5 in. x 11 in. paper at 86 images per minute (duplex). 
Engineering And Services:   As part of this order the vendor will provide all engineering and installation support  necessary to assure the document imaging system is properly installed, operational and meets the customer's needs.  The vendor will provide onsite training to assure the customer can properly operate and maintain, from a user's perspective, all components and features of the imaging system.  The vendor will provide all documentation to include operator manuals, system specifications, and maintenance manuals as they apply.
The following provisions and clauses apply: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items and citing: 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.222-41 and 52.222-42; 252.204-7004 Central Contractor Registration; 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Applicable to Defense Acquisition of Commercial Items, and citing 252.225-7001.
