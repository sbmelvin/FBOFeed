<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) announces the availability of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. DAAD19-03-R-0004 dated December 2002 for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) Odortype Detection Program .  The DARPA ATO is soliciting innovative proposals to (1) determine whether genetically-determined odortypes can be used to identify specific individuals, and if so (2) to develop the science and enabling technology for detecting and identifying specific individuals by such odortypes.  The Odortype Detection program will leverage research that has demonstrated that the same set of genes that code for internal immune system self/non-self recognition in mice – the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) – als o code for individual odortype.  Although experimental data for humans is far less quantitative, behavioral studies have yielded compelling results to suggest that such MHC-determined odor individuality can also be expected in humans.  Recent experimental results with mice suggest that MHC-determined urinary odor is expressed as a mixture of volatile carboxylic acids occurring in relative concentrations that are characteristic of the odortype.  This suggests the possibility of an exploitable chemosignal cor responding to an individual’s genetically determined odortype.  This effort will be divided into two phases.  The goal of phase 1 will be to determine whether an exploitable, robust signature corresponding to individual human odortype exists.   The goal of  phase 2 will be to build a detector that can reliably detect the signature identified in phase one with high sensitivity and specificity.  Proposals that focus only on phase 2 will not be considered for this solicitation.  Multiple awards are anticipated.   Total program funding for this research and development effort shall not exceed $3,200,000 in FY 2003.  The BAA provides further information on the above areas of interest, proposal format, submission instructions, evaluation process, and other informati on.  Proposals must be received at DARPA not later than 1600 local time on January 29, 2003.  This BAA may be electronically downloaded from ARO’s website at http://www.aro.army.mil/research/index.htm.

52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors will be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:  1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance and 3) Cost.  Technical Capability and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than cost. 
Factor I.  Technical Capability ? Evaluation will be based on the extent to which the offeror clearly demonstrates the following:

1. The methodology used to recruit, evaluate and recommend qualified candidates.
2. A thorough knowledge of the structure of the Department of the Navy and how the Civilian Personnel Establishment  supports the war fighting capability of the Department of the Navy.
3. A thorough understanding of the Merit Principles, EEO laws and appointment in accordance with  5 USC 3393.

The following adjectives should be used as general guidance in assessing the technical capability:
"Outstanding"  Very significantly exceeds most or all solicitation requirements.  "Better"  Fully meets all solicitation requirements and significantly exceeds many of the solicitation requirements. 	"Acceptable"  Meets all solicitation requirements.  "Marginal"	Less than "Acceptable."  There are some deficiencies in the technical proposal. 	"Unacceptable"	Technical proposal has many deficiencies and/or gross omissions.

Factor II:  Past Performance:  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on a maximum of three (3) previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, or email) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

The following adjectives should be used as general guidance in assessing Past Performance: ?Neutral?: No relevant past performance available for evaluation.	?Outstanding?: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based upon offeror's past performance. ?Better?: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product.  ?Satisfactory?: Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product. ?Marginal?: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product.   A rating of marginal does not by itself make the proposal ineligible for award.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) plans to support a program to study miniature atomic frequency standards using the methods of Coherent Population Trapping and Raman Scattering.  The objectives of the work are 1) to reduce the size of the physics package of an atomic clock to the cubic millimeter scale, 2) to operate the physics package on less than 10 mW of power, and 3) to achieve a fractional frequency instability of less than or equal to 1x10E-11 at one hour.  Qualifications include world-class experience (and publication record) with: miniature atomic frequency standards, VCSEL semiconductor lasers, diode lasers noise as applied to atomic spectroscopy, and nonlinear optical resonance methods of CPT and narrow-line Raman scattering.  The place of performance will be the NIST Boulder Labs, and the period of performance will be 8 months.  It is the Government's belief that the skills of the researchers engaged by the University of Colorado uniquely qualify them for this work.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to purchase the services of a Biologist to Maintain and Generate Muscarinic Receptor Mutant Mice and Assist in their Molecular and Physiological Analysis in the Laboratory of Biooranic Chemistry for one year.  Duties to be performed by the Biologist shall be:  A)  Animal Husbandry:  1) Maintains multiple mutant mouse colonies housed in Bldg. 14C-North (4 racks) and Bldg. 8 (1 rack) (about 2000 mice total); 2) Identifies all mice by ear tags; 3) Sets up matings to ensure that the different mutant mouse lines are present at sufficient numbers and ages; 4) Keeps electronic records of all of Dr. Wess? mutant mice house in Bldg. 14C-North and Bldg. 8.  fore each individual mouse, these records will show mouse sex (male or female), date of birth, genetic background, generation number, and whether or not the mouse has a specific mutation; 5) Generates mice by homozygous or heterozygous matings for experiments to be carried out in Dr. Wess? lab or by Dr. Wess? collaborators.  It is estimated that 1500 mice will be needed per year; 6) Uses PCR or Southern blot analysis to determine whether the mice used for experiments are wild-type or mutant mice.  Based on this analysis, mice will be classed into different experimental groups.  B) Lab Work (to be carried out in Bldg. 8A):  1) Assists in the generation of conditional muscarinice receptor mutant mice by carrying out PCR or Southern blot analyses to identify mouse embryonic stem cells and, subsequently, mice that carry the desired mutation; 2) Assists in the molecular and biochemical analysis of muscarinic receptor mutant mice by studying the expression patterns of individual muscarinic receptors.  This will require the use of RT-PCR, radioligand binding, Western blotting and immunoprecipitation techniques; 3) Assists in the physiological analysis of muscarinic receptor mutant mice.  Specifically, islets will be prepared from the mouse pancreas of wild type and muscarinic receptor mutant mice.  The ability of the pancreatic islets to release insulin following different physiological stimuli (e.g. glucose, acetylcholine) will be examined.  This analysis will show which muscarinic receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of insulin release.  The individual shall have a Bachelor?s degree in Biology or a related science.  All responsible small business sources and 8(a) sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be within the Simplified Acquisition Threshold for Purchases up to $100,000.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Juan Francisco Clerico A., Executive Director, Vinccler Oil and Gas, C.A., Prolongacion Avenida La Salle,Edificio Fiorela, P.B., Colinas de Los Caobos, Caracas 1050, Venezuela, Phone: 011-58-212-793-1411 or 782-4666, Fax: (58-2) 793.6331, e-mail: vinccler@vinccler.com  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a new natural gas pipeline that would originate from the gas field at East Falcon Block, and extend west to the edge of the Gulf of Venezuela, where it would join up with an existing cross-country gas transmission pipeline owned by PDVSA.  

The project sponsor, Venezuela de Inversiones y Construcciones Clerico, C.A. (Vinccler), is a privately held Venezuelan firm that was founded in 1956 by the Clerico family.  Vinccler is a leading Venezuelan construction firm with its own in-house engineering and design capabilities.  Vinccler was the first Venezuelan company to participate in the country?s Field Reactivation Program, which began in 1992.  The company owns interests in the South Monagas Unit in eastern Venezuela, and the East Falcon Block in western Venezuela.  Vinccler, together with Pacific Petroleum LLC (of California), are planning to develop and further expand the existing East Falcon Block located in the northwestern part of Venezuela, approximately 200 km northeast of Lake Maracaibo.  Pacific Petroleum?s role in the project is as a developer, and they have no long-term interest in operating the gas field development.  The proposed study is needed in order to fully exploit the proven oil and gas reserves.  Due to the enormous quantities of gas associated with the oil from East Falcon, Vinccler and Pacific have entered into discussions with Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) to expand the original scope of the project to now include the exploitation and commercialization of gas.  

The gas project would encompass the construction of a new natural gas pipeline that would originate from the gas field at East Falcon Block, and extend west to the edge of the Gulf of Venezuela, where it would join up with an existing cross-country gas transmission pipeline owned by PDVSA.  The project consists of gas gathering and treatment equipment to be located in the East Falcon exploration and production block, a compressor station, and underground 12-inch diameter pipeline with an approximate length of 100 km, and control and metering devices.  The total estimated project cost is $60 million, of which $34 million represents potential US exports.  This project is being carried out under terms of an Operating Service Agreement (OSA) signed in 1995 between PDVSA and Vinccler.  


The terms of reference for the feasibility study would include the following tasks: 1) Pipeline and Flow Line Route Study, 2) Pipeline and Flow Line System Study, 3) Cost Estimate & Outline Program, and 4) Study Report.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $375,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Caracas time, January 15, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

By virtue of its previous work managing the ORBDNRC, the NOF has developed an extensive existing catalog of evidence-based, peer-reviewed fact sheets, publications, implementation guides, and databases that the ORBDNRC must have access to in order to fulfill requests. The NOF currently holds the rights to these resources. In order to develop new resources, the Contractor also must have access to subject matter experts in osteoporosis and related bone diseases and to health education and outreach experts. The estimated level of effort for this project is 6.3 Full Time Equivalents per year for 4 years.  A determination for use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302?1. The NOF has the prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their preliminary and current work.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in performance make competition for this additional work unfeasible. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NIAMS. A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 561110. This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available. See Numbered Note 22.

The goal is to determine the nature and magnitude of spin wave generation in devices exhibiting spin momentum transfer effects using time-averaged and time-resolved magneto-optic methods. The measurements are to be performed at NIST using a recently acquired variable temperature/high magnetic field optical cryostat and pulsed laser diode system. The University of Colorado staff has a combination of skills and past experience in magneto-optics, time-resolved optical measurements, coherent control techniques, and microwave circuit design. They are also familiar with spin momentum transfer phenomena, have a thorough understanding of both experimental evidence and theoretical understanding. Specific work tasks include design and construction of a dual laser pump/probe system for the measurement of coherent spin precession in  GaAs and measurement of time-resolved dynamics of spins in GaAs under a variety of excitations, including rf field  pulses delivered with coplanar waveguide technology, proximity effects due to hyperpolarization of nuclei in ferromagnet/semiconductor (FM/SC) heterostructures, and peristaltic pumping as a result of ferromagnetic resonance in the ferromagnet of a FM/SC heterostructure. The contract period is January 13, 2003 through February 9, 2004.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned..

No deviation will be granted unless specifically approved by the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative.
(b)  The following procedures apply to requests for specification waivers.
(1)  Requests for deviations and waivers shall be submitted by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer with a copy to the Quality Representative (QR).  Each request shall provide the following information:  Contractor name; contract number; contract line item and product, if applicable; clause number, paragraph and subparagraph, as appropriate; the nature of the request; the reason for the request; the corrective action being taken by the Contractor to correct and prevent recurrence of the condition(s) causing the nonconformance; and equitable price adjustment offered over the administrative fee.  In extraordinary situations, the Contractor may initially submit the request for a deviation or waiver through the cognizant QR to the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) in the Directorate of Quality Assurance and Technical Operations, Defense Energy Support Center (DESC).  Extraordinary situation requests shall be submitted formally to the Contracting Officer prior to close of business of the next DESC normal workday.  As used in this clause, the term ?extraordinary situation? means the matter cannot await resolution until the DESC normal workday (0800 to 1630 hours), Monday through Friday - Federal holidays excluded.

(4)  If the waiver is granted modifying this contract but the supplies accepted are nevertheless determined to be in conformity with contract specifications, the Contractor shall still be obligated to pay the consideration originally agreed upon in support of the waiver.  If, however, this consideration exceeds $500, a second contract modification shall be issued reducing the Contractor's obligation to $500 (the administrative cost of issuing the two required modifications).
(c)  When notification of nonconforming supplies is received after the supplies have been accepted, and the Government determines not to exercise its right to reject or to require correction under the INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES - FIXED-PRICE or INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF SUPPLIES clause, then in no event will consideration be less than $250 to cover administrative costs.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is issuing this NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT for an A-76 study being performed at our Washington, DC and Fort Worth, Texas locations. In response to the announced Commercial Activity study of 30 positions covering Ink Making and Roller Recovery, this action will comply with the ?current? procedures prescribed in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, the "Commercial Activities" program. Services involved are described below for each functional element. A cost comparison will be performed later in the calendar year to determine the feasibility and economy of converting the ink making and roller recovery services performed by Government.  Therefore, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is seeking vendors nationwide that have the capability, background, skilled personnel, past experience and resources to provide the Bureau with two distinct functions:Ink Manufacturing and Roller Recovery operations.  

Ink Manufacturing is located at two geographic locations (Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX).  The Washington and Fort Worth facilities both produce a variety of different inks each year for use in the production of U.S. currency.  The inks produced are 1) intaglio inks used on intaglio printing presses and 2) high security inks for use on letterpress presses (Washington DC only).  The equipment used to produce the different types of inks includes automated batching systems for weighing ink ingredients, industrial mixers of varying capacities and high-pressure three-roll mills for complete dispersion of raw materials.  Since the quality of the inks produced at the Bureau is very critical, a testing lab performs certification tests on all ink batches produced and Inks must pass the tests before they can be used.  In addition to regular ink production, the Ink Manufacturing Section also provides technical support for the development of new and experimental inks. (NOTE:  The ink chemists and technical support staff who do ink development are NOT currently included in the number of positions subject to our A-76 analysis, since they are members of the Office of Technical Support and not the Office of Production Support as are the ink makers.)

Roller Recovery Section Operation: The Bureau of Engraving and Printing?s Roller Recovery Section produces wiper rolls and inking-in rolls for the cylinder wipe, intaglio printing presses used to print U.S. currency. To fabricate a wiper roll, three distinct layers (different formulations and physical properties) of PVC (polyvinylchloride) material are applied to a steel wiper roll core using special application and curing procedures. First,  raw materials are mixed together to make the various formulations of PVC coatings.  Then, the PVC is applied to the roll.  Following application of the PVC layers, the wiper roll surfaces are finished and polished in a lathe to obtain specific dimensions and surface finish.  To produce a wiper roll that meets the physical requirements of operating on high-speed currency presses, the Roller Recovery Section closely monitors the quality of both incoming raw materials and the PVC formulations of the respective wiper roll layers. Operation of the PVC coating machines and the mechanical soundness and condition of wiper roll cores are also monitored very closely.  When completed, all wiper rolls undergo a series of final quality inspections to assess the bonding of PVC layers, hardness and surface defects.  In addition to regular wiper roll production, the Roller Recovery Section also provides technical support for the development of experimental rolls needed for new inks and currency design features.    

ACTION REQUIRED: It is requested that any vendor in the United States having the skilled personnel, talent, capability, resources and past experience to provide the above service and operation of these functions provide by email the following information to the point of contract indicated in this notice, Mr. ROBERT KNAUER.  Please provide:

1. Name of Company Contract
2. Phone and Fax numbers
3. Email addresses
4. Company Website address
5. At least two to three (2-3) commercial and government references that can verify that your firm has done the type of work contemplated and that provides information about the quality of your past performance. Include the following information for each contract:

1. Name of Contracting Activity or Customer
2. Contract Number or Other Identification Number
3. Contract Type
4. Total Contract Value or Volume
5. Description of Service 
6. Contracting Officer Point of Contact and Telephone Number
7. Technical/Project Manager Point of Contact and Telephone Number
8. Provide a brief (2page) description of your firm?s history and organization and a description of its facilities, products, services, and customers as they relate to performance of pre-and post-award contracting for the commercial and Government.

AGAIN, NO SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  This is for information on source availability only.   No site visits or pre-solicitation conference will be held until a determination of source availability is made by this Office.  If a contract should be awarded as a result of any A76 competition, it will be because the cost of contracting are lower than the cost of continued Government performance as prescribed in the current OMB A76 Circular and Revised Supplemental Handbook.  All Government personnel adversely affected by conversion of Government performed services to contract have the Right of First Refusal for jobs for which they are qualified. The successful offeror shall provide all management, supervision, quality control, coordination, personnel and labor to perform the above services. Due to the type of work conducted in BEP, it is required that contractor personnel be United States citizens. Additionally, some of the functions involve working with sensitive information; therefore, all company personnel must be eligible for a full access security clearance. It is anticipated that there will be one procurement action required to complete this action, if the cost comparison results in contract award. The expected term of the contract shall be an initial one-year award and four one-year options with a total contract period not-to-exceed 60 months.  A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated.

<DESC>This is Amendment No. 2 to Solicitation No. NCBD11-03.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide questions submitted by vendors and the answers provided by the technical representative.  Q1) Regarding Task/deliverable #2: (a) How many "speeches, Power Point presentations, brochures, exhibits, etc." do they anticipate (for each category)?  (b) Is graphic design a requirement for either the Power Point presentations or brochures? A1) (a) As needed; (b) All graphic design will be done in house.  Q2) Regarding Task/Deliverable #3: (a) How many "periodic reports" are required during the contract period?  (b) What is meant by "lead preparation"  of periodic reports and reviews of activities and organizations, including several required reports to Congress. Is the vendor to lead a team of FTEs - who is the vendor leading?  A2) (a) GPRA 2 to 3 times a year; assist in narrative of budget justification; and also reports for congress. These will be determined once an appropriation is received. (b) "Lead Preparation"  The vendor will be working independently on these task.  The Vendor will contact Program Staff and Constituents on as "as needed basis" to review and comment on the reports.  Q3) Regarding Task/Deliverable# 4: (a) Again, who will the vendor "lead?"  (b) What does "interactive" mean in the context of the work to be performed? Is IT development anticipated?  A3)  The vendor will be interact with program staff, constituents, and others in order to perform the work.  There is no IT development anticipated.  Q4) What is "NCBDDD, Planning and Evaluation Programs"? Is the sentence supposed to read "knowledgeable of NCBDDD and planning and evaluation of programs?"  A4) The name of the team that the vendor will be working with is NCBDDD Planning and Evaluation.  The vendor needs to be knowledgeable about NCBDDD and the programs within the mission, and also have experience in planning and evaluation.  Q5) Finally, why is "knowledge of NCBDDD, Planning and Evaluation Programs" a requirement? None of the work described in the SOW is technical or scientific and at most requires collection of information from knowledgeable sources and presentation of that information in various formats. What is its point value in terms of evaluation of proposals? A5) The knowledge of NCBDDD Program is a requirement, since the vendor will work independently in the development of the deliverables.  The vendor will interact with program staff and scientist  on an as needed basis, therefore, their knowledge of the mission of NCBDDD program is essential to the success of this purchase order.   Q6)  Activity 1 states "facilitate the development and presentation of 1- year programmtic and research plans for all NCBDDD organizational units and prepare briefing book outlining such plans for NCBDDD senior management" with a due date of December 30, 2002.  Given that quotes are not due until December 18 with awards to be made after that date, is there some flexibilty in this due date?   A6) There is some flexibility with this date.  Q7) Has some work related to this first deliverable already been completed that would allow the successful offeror to complete this task quickly?   A7) Some work has been done however we will need to complete by January 30, 2003.  Q8) Can you/the Center provide us a list of the required reports to Congress to be completed under the scope of work?  Since these are typically complex reports requiring scientific and other input as well as cross-clearance within the agency, it would be helpful to have more definitive guidelines with respect to how many will be required.  A8) We don't have an exact list at this time.  The number of reports will depend on the exact working of the appropriations language.  Q9) Is there an estimate of how many and what kind of periodic reports and reviews of activities and organizations will be required?   A9) GPRA is two to three times a year.  Also, the vendor would assist with the narrative portion of the budget justification about individual programs within the Center.  Q10)  Does the Center anticipate that reviews of organizations will require consultant travel?  If so, are there guidelines for how much travel might be required?   A10) No.  Q11) Can information be provided on the total amount of funding available for this task order?   A11) No, but as a rule all procurements estimated at $25,000 and over shall be advertised and made available for competition.****

<DESC>This modification is made to the notice issued earlier today to acquire the services of two contract specialists.  
1)  Self-employed individuals with the requisite experience are encouraged to respond to this RFQ.
2)  Self-employed individuals responding to this RFQ must reside within the Washington, D.C. commuting area.

There will be no formal request for proposals or other solicitations regarding this announcement. TABLE OF CONTENTS: Abstract Part I - Research Interests A. Introduction B. Mission Part II - Proposal Preparation Part III - Proposal Evaluation. ABSTRACT: The Air Expeditionary Forces Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Tyndall AFB FL is interested in receiving research proposals in the areas of advanced technologies that develop chemical reactor systems. These reactor systems are intended to (1) produce, or deliver, directed-energy weapon chemicals in combat quantities, under deployed force conditions, (2) convert waste chemicals and materials from combat weapon-system maintenance and sustainment operations to energy or benign compounds, or (3) efficiently produce thermal, mechanical or electrical energy on demand using high-energy chemistry and reactor systems compatible with force deployment constraints. In addition, systems are desired that utilize compact unit operation to (1) recover waste energy from force deployment activities for reutilization or (2) rejuvenate water from force deployment activities for reutilization. Systems developed under this effort must be capable of being easily integrated with existing deployed base concepts while anticipating the requirements of the AF Expeditionary Aerospace Force doctrine for the future. Proposals should describe scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering to increase knowledge and understanding in these areas. This Broad Agency Announcement consists of three parts: PART I - Research Interests - PART II - Proposal Preparation - PART III - Proposal Evaluation. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. It is, however, an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Companies responding to this announcement are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) constitutes a solicitation for proposals under the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Multiple awards are anticipated. The BAA describes research requirements and methods for preparing and submitting proposals. PART I RESEARCH INTERESTS A. INTRODUCTION. This is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Expeditionary Forces Technology Division (AFRL/MLQ) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study, experimentation, and process engineering directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. AFRL/MLQ contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in Deployed Base Infrastructure, Force Protection, and Weapon System Logistics Technology. This BAA is intended to cover technology associated with the sustainment and logistics support of advanced weapons. Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/MLQ should not only carefully examine this BAA, but are also strongly encouraged to contact the AFRL/MLQ technical person identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/MLQ may have in a specific research project. Prior to submitting a formal proposal, offerors are to submit white paper on their proposed research topic not to exceed three (3) pages in length. Submit white papers to the following address: Air Force Research Laboratory Contracting Division, AFRL/MNK, Attn. Ms. Brenda Soler, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction). Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received. Invited proposals may be submitted at any time during the period the BAA is open. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants. Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources. While no parts of this requirement lend themselves to being severed for set-aside to Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs), or Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), the Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto. The division goal is to award thirty percent (30%) of the contracts to Small Businesses, ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Small Disadvantaged Businesses and Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), ten percent (10%) of the contracts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions, over the life of this BAA. For the purpose of this BAA, the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710). In the event sufficient acceptable proposals are not received to fulfill these goals, awards will be made to those proposals received, which are acceptable regardless of source. B. MISSION The mission of the Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) Technology Division is to conduct research and engineering development that results in the demonstration of high-risk, high-payoff technology needed to meet the current and future requirements that result from the Air Force migration to the Expeditionary Aerospace Force (EAF) doctrine. Long-term technology development is needed to produce lighter, more rapid bare-base deployment; a more secure and protected force structure; and rapid, effective deployment of advanced Air Force weapon systems. Technological advances in these key areas will ensure sustained global superiority of the Air Force for the foreseeable future through improved Air Force and Joint Operations readiness, rapid exploitation and utilization of the space mission, the successful deployment of advanced, complex weapons, and more effective peace-time training. PART II PROPOSAL PREPARATION Each proposal submitted should consist of two volumes. Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal and Volume 2 should address the price/cost portions of the proposal. Volume 1 should be limited to a total of 25 double-spaced pages, including resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc. Pages in excess of the specified 25 double-spaced pages will be removed and returned to the offeror before evaluation starts. A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Minimum print size is 10-point type, or 12 pitch. EVERY PROPOSAL SHALL HAVE AT LEAST ONE COPY SUBMITTED ON DISK OR VIA E-MAIL WITH A HARD COPY OF THE SIGNATURE PAGE SENT VIA REGULAR MAIL.

PART III PROPOSAL EVALUATION A. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below. The factors are listed in descending order of importance. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. 1. The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MLQ mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this Division?s overall research program. 2. The offeror?s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives. 3. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives. 4. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds. B. Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MLQ technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered to have sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review. C. It is the policy of AFRL/MLQ to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation within the Government. The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. D. Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MLQ program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or the Program Manager identified above. For any other concerns, interested parties may E-Mail AFRL/MN's Ombudsman, Lt Col Mary T. Quinn, quinnm@eglin.af.mil or AFRL MLQ's Ombudsman, Lt Col Donald R. Huckle Jr, don.huckle@tyndall.af.mil.

<CONTACT>Paul J. Fiorello, Contract Specialist  973-724-7465
<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources for a low cost, high speed system, capable of applying a robust, long  lived “2-D data symbol” to the exterior surface of different ammunition items  that will enable automated/electronic “reading” of data unique to the item.   Background:  Emerging weapon systems will be employing increasingly  sophisticated automated/robotic ammunition handling and re-arm technologies to  reduce crew sizes and labor, and increase rates of fire.  These systems will  need to uniquely identify the item they are handling, and capture additional  information about the item. This information could include type of projectile,  lot number, precise weight, etc. and could be used in support of improved  firing precision, safety, on-board inventory accountability, and for quality  assurance purposes.  Currently there are a variety of machine readable  data “symbologies” that enable optical reading of encoded data. “Datamatrix” is  one such example of a public domain code and is a preferred symbology.  Other 2- D symbologies may be considered.  Requirements:  What is needed is a complete  marking system that can take information pertaining to any item and encode that  information into a data symbology that is then applied as needed, directly to  the surface of the ammunition. Typically, for gun launched ammunition, it is  expected that multiple data symbols would need to be placed in a  circumferential “band” around the projectile.  This manner of application would  ensure that an optical “reader” located in a fixed position within the weapon  platform would be able to “capture” and decode at least one complete data  symbol from its field of view, as the item moves past the reader - regardless  of the rotational position of the projectile about its longitudinal axis, and  its radius of curvature. The application system must be one that can apply a  robust symbology accurately and quickly in a production environment. Adhesive  backed labels are not considered to be suitable for our needs – primarily due  to concerns about peeling off over time and possibly negatively effecting aero- ballistics.  Our thinking at this point is that a continuous ink jet based  system may be a viable approach, however, we are interested in hearing about  other approaches as well if the requirements identified herein can adequately  be addressed.  The applied symbol(s) should:  1) Be able to encode at least 40  alpha-numeric characters of data and employ a degree of error correction, 2) Be  scalable in size from roughly .25” X .25”  to 1.0” X 1.0”, 3) Have adjustable  minimum constituent cell sizes, 4) Resist smudging/smearing/wearing off when  hand rubbed, 5) Not rise above the surface of the item greater than  approx. .001”, 6) Be suitable for application to surfaces of various types –  ranging from bare metal (aluminum, steel, etc.) to plastics and cellulosics,  and painted metal surfaces, 7) Be one of many that are applied in a  circumferential manner around a projectile so that an associated reader device  will always “capture” at least one complete symbol within its field of view  (Associated reader device may have to be as close as 1 inch away from the  marked surface), 8) Remain viable/”readable” for at least 20 years and endure  storage and transportation conditions that at times could range from –60 F to  +180 F, 9) Remain readable if exposed to sun/UV for extended periods of time,  10) Not come off or degrade to an unreadable state after exposure to wind blown  rain, 11) Not come off in flight or adversely effect flight ballistics in any  way, 12) Not effect the surface of the item in a manner that shortens the  useful life of the item – e.g. should not cause or accelerate corrosion, or  stress cracking to any significant degree, 13) Be able to be read by a fixed  reader device when moving past the reader at a speed as high as approximately  20 feet/second.  The Application System ideally should be able to complete  marking of any projectile from 1” diameter up to 6” diameter and 120 lbs. with  a circumferential “band” of multiple, uniformly spaced data symbols in  approximately 5-10 seconds, although longer times may be acceptable.  The  system ideally will also be able to confirm that the data symbol applied is of  adequate quality or resolution to ensure reliable decoding by an optical reader  device.  It should be reasonably portable and easily set up in a facility where  ammunition will be produced, or stored.  Any ink jet based system must not use  Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) based inks due to environmental issues.  Any ink,  paint etc. used to make the mark shall be reasonably quick drying – although  supplemental directed hot air may be employed to accelerate drying.   Respondents to this survey should describe their equipment, the types of 2-D  markings they can apply, experience in this area, and overall capabilities to  address the requirements indicated above.  It would also be of benefit, if the  respondent provided a sample(s) of 2-D marks applied to metal surfaces by a  production oriented process of theirs that they feel does, or can, meet the  requirements indicated.   Samples should be sent to U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC,  Logistics R&D Activity – AMSTA-AR-ASL (Bldg. 455), ATTN:  Mr. Jim Fedewitz,  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, email fedewitz@pica.army.mil.  Technical  questions should be addressed to Mr. Jim Fedewitz, Phone 973-724-3924.  A  follow-up detailed questionnaire may be provided to survey respondents and on- site visits may also be performed to further assess company capabilities. Also,  interested firms should provide their company name, address, point-of-contact  with telephone number and e-mail address, size of business (small/large) and  country where the facility is located.   Responses to this market survey must  be submitted within 40 calendar days from the date of this publication to U.S.  Army TACOM-ARDEC, ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APH, Paul Fiorello, Building 9, Picatinny  Arsenal, NJ 07806-500 or by email to pfiorel@pica.army.mil; phone 973-724- 7465.  This Market Survey is for planning purposes and should not be construed  as a request for proposal or as a commitment on the part of the Government to  issue a solicitation.  Information and samples shall be submitted at no cost or  obligation to the Government.  The Government is not obligated to notify  respondents of the results of this survey.  See Numbered Note 25.

<DESC>MSC's current help desk vendor has supported shipboard applications for the last 10 years. Approximately 2 years ago the helpdesk started to support shore side applications that are housed in MSC’s Corporate Data Center. With the advent of Navy Marine Corps Intranet (N/MCI), the help desk was designated the Global Help Desk (GHD) and now serves as the central call center for non-N/MCI enterprise related issues. The MSC Global Help Desk is physically located in southeastern Virginia and provides support to ships and shore locations worldwide. Since the incumbent has been operating the Help Desk for the past 10 years, MSC cannot clearly establish if they are receiving the best value for their dollar in outsourcing their help desk. MSC’s goal is to establish best value through partnering with "long-term players" with ancestry and experience of implementing best practices of the i ndustry. Being that the current service provider has never been forced to re-compete for services it places MSC in a similar situation as an enterprise that has never outsourced a help desk before. The purpose of this RFI is to ascertain the existence of possible Help Desk support providers. MSC is also interested in learning what is common industry practice in Help Desk support. Additional information pertaining to this software solutions requirement can be found at http://govauctions.procuri.com. Interested parties MUST register as a Supplier in the NAVICP eProcurement tool at http://govauctions.procuri.com. Each registered supplier can gain access to the RFI at http://govauctions.procuri.com. The Procuri System is being used for transfer of ALL information. All information can be sent through the system by via uploads, comments or questions. Phone calls and emails  will ONLY be accepted if related to technical problems with the Procuri system. -- N/MCI is a Navy wide contract for help desk automation. In taking ownership of the local help desks, N/MCI now supports desktop seats, local connectivity and email.

<CONTACT>XDS1312
<DESC>This is a resubmission of a Sources Sought Notice for an upcoming Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) competitive acquisition for Vaneaxial Collective Protection System (CPS) Supply Fan Motors.  The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis unless two or more responsible small business concerns are identified, in which case the requirement will be set-aside for small business.  The applicable SIC code for this acquisition is 3621 and the size standard is 1,000 employees. The motor procured under this acquisition will serve as a prototype motor replacement to the currently used Milspec certified motor with one that is more cost effective and more easily manufactured.  The Government anticipates procuring one motor each from up to three separate vendors that meet the requirements specified herein.  The current version of this motor is installed with in the American Fan Company Model Number A104 and A105 fans, which are used in a shipboard application as part of the Shipboard CPS Backfit Program. The prototype motors must be able to meet three requirements for this acquisition: (1) The motors are required to meet the performance specifications detailed in MIL-PRF-24755A, dated 31 May 2001.  These are the approved Performance Specifications to which high-pressure Vaneaxial fans for shipboard use are manufactured; the motor specifications are described within this Specifications document.  A 15 Hp motor is sought for this acquisition.  Although MIL-PRF-24755A calls for a motor with a maximum of 20 Hp for installation within an A105 fan, continuing development of the fan has led to the requirement of only a 15 HP motor.  MIL-PRF-24755A is attached to this notice as a separate file; (2) The motors must be capable of being ins talled within the American Fan Company (AFC) Model Number A105 fans. Interface drawing NV21015B provides the AFC fan dimensions within which the motors must fit and is attached as a separate document to this notice; and (3) Potential sources must be able to supply the required motors within 26 weeks after receipt of a purchase order.  Price will also be a consideration.  Potential offerors must submit a Capabilities Statement, which addresses the following: (1) how their product meets the mandatory technical specifications and interface requirements detailed in MIL-PRF-24755A and drawing NV21015B; (2) applicable product drawings; (3) a listing of previous customers to whom the same or similar motors were supplied, the quantities supplied, applicable contract or purchase order numbers, and customer points of contacts and phone numbers; (4) the price of the motor(s).  In order to  assist in the Government's evaluation of a competitive small business set-aside, potential offerors shall also clearly indicate their business status.  Due to the planned acquisition schedule, the Capabilities Statements shall be provided for evaluation, preferably in electronic form, to xds13@nswc.navy.mil, Attn:  XDS 13-12, reference quote number N00178-03-Q-3003, no later than 30 days after the date of this notice.  If electronic responses are not feasible, they may be provided via fax to (540) 653-6810, Attn:  XDS 13-12.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area, therefore the solicitation with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nswc.navy.mil/supply Hard copies will not be provided.

<DESC>NAVSEA Philadelphia is seeking potential sources for a portable torque metering system for use on the Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC). LCAC craft utilize two shrouded air propellers for propulsion and four centrifugal fans to provide lift air to its cushion. The LCAC has two identical combined lift and propulsion transmission system positioned on the port and starboard side of the craft. The lift shafts are identified as shafts S3/S4, and the propulsion shafts S11/S12.  Each of these combined propulsion and lift transmission systems are powered by two Vericor Power Systems TF40B engines.  The proposed portable torque measurement system must provide for separate torsion meters that will independently measure torque going to the lift and propulsion ends of the transmission. The system should be capable of displaying rpm and horsepower, be intended for use on heavy wall (>0.18 inch ) shafts, be capable of measuring a minimum torque of 28,000 lbs-ft, be capable of absorbing a transient overtorque of ±50% without damage or loss of accuracy and include a military rated real-time data acquisition system.  Installation of the torque measurement system should not cause the shaft to exceed out of balance criteria of 0.1 in-oz per plane.  The system will be exposed to operating temperatures of 0ºF to 160ºF with a relative humidity of up to 100% and salt air exposure and spray to the hardware.  Technical manuals required for installation, operation, safe handling and parts breakdown should be provided with the system.  Consideration will be given to existing and proven, commercial-off-the-shelf systems. A necessary requirement for this system is that it be portable, and easily moved from one craft to another.  This is a request for information only and is not a re quest for proposals or announcement of a solicitation.  Firms interested in furnishing a portable torque metering system are requested to contact Basem Makar, Code 935310, Naval Surface Warfare Center, 5001 S. Broad Street, Bldg. 619, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1403 to obtain more detailed and specific requirements for the system.
