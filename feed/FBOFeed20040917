<CONTACT>Leslie Leavitt Purchasing Agent 7022938642     LLeavitt@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Boulder City Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Jefferson Freeway Investors, LLC, 27708 Jefferson Avenue, Suite 200, Temecula, CA  92590.  This purchase order is for the build-out of a leased office space through GSA.  GSA processed the request for additional office space for the Bureau of Reclamation's Southern California Area Office (SCAO) and in March of 2004 signed a lease with Jefferson Freeway Investors (lessor) for the Bureau of Reclamation.  The lessor, by requirements stated in the Solicitation for Offers (SFO) was responsible for the build out of the new office space.  GSA worked with Reclamation and Jefferson Freeway Investors to ensure the design and construction of the office space met all government requirements.   For the leased space, as part of the lease agreement, there is a tenant improvement allowable cost (build-out cost).   This allowable cost usually becomes part of the rent and operating costs.  If the build-out cost exceeds the allowable cost, the difference can be either be paid in lump sum or amortized over the term of the lease.  This transaction normally goes through GSA.  However, Reclamation desires to pay through this purchase order the build-out costs in a lump sum instead of amortized over the term of the lease. This purchase order will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is September 23, 2004.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue as Request for Quotation NNG04080180Q on a sole source basis for the following item: Qty 2 - Deformable Mirror System includes: -	144 channel driver -	12 bit electronics  -	1 deformable mirror, mounted and wirebound (gold coated)  -	Control Computer System  -	Power Supply NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from Boston Micromachines Corporation  under the authority of 10.U.S.C 2304 © (1), Only One Responsible Source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  The government has a requirement for a deformable mirror system. These devices consist of a micro-deformable mirror with 144 discrete actuators of ~300 microns/actuator extent, a proprietary product of Boston Micromachines, as well as the high precision, 12-bit control electronics system to permit controlled mirror deflections of ~10-9 meters.  These devices are prototypes of  the main components of a wavefront corrector system to be built at GSFC for the  Terrestrial Planet Finder Project (TPF) and are of potential applicability in other high contrast, space optical systems.  These MEMS devices represent a cutting edge technological alternative to the piezo-electric based deformable mirror systems currently being analyzed for use with TPF.   The MEMS systems have many potential advantages including small size, high actuator density, potential scalability to very large numbers of actuators, low power consumption, and radiation damage resistance.  In addition, the limited testing to date shows that these devices have sufficient stability and precision to be considered as a viable alternative deformable mirror technology for TPF.  We seek to procure this set of mirrors (144-actuators) for initial testing and characterization prior to obtaining a similar but larger (1024-actuator) set of mirrors for complete analysis and testing to determine if they can indeed meet the flight level requirements and have the anticipated advantages compared to the other technology under consideration. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 10/01/2004.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 454312   The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Suburban Propane under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to provide propane gas on a recurring basis for EPA's Edison, NJ laboratory greenhouse to support plant-related research . The contractor shall provide, on a periodic basis, up to 16,000 gallons during Year 1 and up to 12,000 gallons during each optional Year 2 and Year 3. This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates Suburban Propoane is uniquely qualified to meet  this requirement based on the fact that it is the only local vendor to provide propane at a fixed rate for the duration of the order.  In addition, the Suburban's tank is already installed at EPA's facility and removal and reinstallation of a tank by a different vendor would add a significant  expense.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A  determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a  sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 422710.  The anticipated award date is 9/30/04.  See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Library of Congress (LOC) intends to negotiate non-competitively with ESRI, Inc., Redlands, California, for the following items/services:
The proposed acquisition will provide, on a firm, fixed price basis, the following products and services: 
Software allowing the Congressional Cartography Program (CCP) to establish a spatial data warehouse infrastructure, which is the driving force behind the program.  A repository for current and historical data used specifically for projects that support Congress and CRS will also be established.  This database will be the support and forefront of all data that the program will use for producing maps for Congress.  The software also allows CCP analysts to develop data relationships, networks, and models to better assist their efforts to Congress.
Software extensions for additional capabilities of the program itself.  These extensions allow the program to develop cartographic templates, professional styles, and 3-Dimensional modeling and analysis.  This will boost the overall products and services from the program.
Consulting will involve on-site and remote support to develop an Enterprise GIS at the Library of Congress.  Consulting will additionally be used in support of the ArcSDE implementation and data loading (creation of the database), as well as support with overall strategic planning for activities at the Library of Congress.
It has been determined at this time that Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. is the only known responsible source capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements.  ESRI, Inc., the developer of the software, is uniquely qualified to provide the upgrades and maintenance of the software, since it retains all proprietary source codes for the specified software products.
Efforts to Obtain Competition\\: ESRI is the worldwide undisputed leader in GIS technology.  The Congressional Cartography Program solely uses ESRI's software for GIS purposes as does the overwhelming majority of federal agencies.  This allows compatibility among other government agencies and outside businesses, including data, workflow, types of analysis, and the technology itself.  The staff of the CCP has worked with ESRI for the past year.  ESRI consulting has a solid relationship with the library in order to make the process as efficient as possible. 
The scope of work is being proposed under the terms, conditions and rates of ESRI's U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) IT schedule for time and materials services work.  
Failure to procure the contract could result in a negative impact in the relationship between the CCP, CRS, and Congress.
Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the Library of Congress' requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within seven calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed solicitation based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Carleton Myers, LOC Contract Specialist, via e-mail at cmye@loc.gov.
Response Time: 3:00p.m. EST, September 24, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RFQ DHQCNT04MP60026 AMENDMENT 0001 is issued to provide responses to vendor questions.  RFQ DHQCNT04MP60026 AMENDMENT 0001 is also posted to the DITCO Contracting Opportunities Web Page:  https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/
requirement.asp?req_no=DHQCNT04MP60026

QUESTION 1:  Will Linux operating system be considered?  RESPONSE:  The following linux platforms can be used to host the remote management solution.  It is also a requirement for the solution to remotely manage these linux platforms:  Red Hat Version 8.0 & 9.0, Red Hat Enterprise edition and Suse Version 9.1.  QUESTION 2:  I realize the RFQ states "mainframe".  Is IBM pSeries a possible solution?  RESPONSE:  The solution can run on the pSeries platform if required. However, the solution must support console message management of the mainframe environment.  QUESTION 3:  Who is the incumbent?  RESPONSE:  None.  QUESTION 4:  Is this a new requirement?  RESPONSE: Yes.  QUESTION 5:  Is an extension of the due date possible? RESPONSE: The Government has a short lead time for this requirement; therefore, the quote due date will remain Friday, 24 Sep 04, 12:00 Noon.  QUESTION 6:  Vendors are required to list the hardware required by DISA to operate the solution. Vendors will be responsible for providing the total number of hardware components required to support their solution in 3 mainframe centers. The centers include Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania; Ogden, Utah; and St. Louis, Missouri. These three sites will be managed centrally from Montgomery, Alabama with a backup site in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  I still am not sure what the requirement is. It says support their solution in 3 datacenters, but then follows with the three sites will be managed centrally from Montgomery and a backup in Oklahoma. So, is it 3, 2 or 5?  RESPONSE:  The vendor solution must allow DISA to remotely manage the three mainframe sites at Mechanicsburg, Ogden, and St. Louis from Mongomery and Oklahoma City.  QUESTION 7:  On 5.3.1.5 are they looking for the solution to provide the security layer or to interface with a security product allowing role base security?  RESPONSE:  As stated in requirements 5.3.1.5 the solutions should have role based security capabilities. This is rated as a Highly relevant requirement.  End of RFQ DHQCNT04MP60025 AMENDMENT 0001.

<SUBJECT>63 -- Personal Radiation Detectors
<SOLNBR>RFPHSBP1004R0177
<RESPDATE>092404
<ARCHDATE>10092004
<CONTACT>Sharon Osborne, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-1219, Fax 202/344-1254, Email sharon.osborne@dhs.gov
<DESC>A number of written questions have been asked about the U. S. Customs and Border Protection specifications applicable to its acquisition of Personal Radiation Detectors as described in the September 2, 2004, FedBizOps notice for solicitation RFPHSBP1004R0177.  The questions, exactly as received, and answers are provided below for the information of all interested parties.

1) Question: “Will it be acceptable if the delivery is after September 24 but on or before  October 22, 2004?”
   
Answer: No, the September 24 due date and time are firm. 

2) Question:  “Section 5.1 states that the PRD unit of type (i) shall detect gamma ray photons with energies as low as 45 keV and as high as 5 MeV.   If the proposed PRD has a lower photon energy limit of 60 KeV will it be disqualified?”  

Answer:  A unit with a lower limit of 60 KeV photon energy would not be acceptable.

3) Question:  “In Section 5.5.1on Page 7 it states that the temperature requirements are: -20C to +50C then it says in the PRD SPECIFICATION TABLE that the temperature needs to be between -30C to +50C.  If our PRD has a temperature range -10C to +40C, will this it be disqualified?”
  
Answer:  The correct temperature range is –20C to+50C.  It will not be disqualified based on the manufacturer's rated optimum temperature. However, it shall be tested at the temperatures indicated in the requirements document and scored on its performance. The results of this test may be cause for the instrument to be disqualified.

4) Question: “BATTERY LIFE & POWER CONSUMPTION: In terms of Batteries, in Section 4.1.16 is states Standard COTS rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries shall power the PRD It also states that Battery life, based on usage 24 hours per day and 7 days per week, shall be indicated in the vendor's proposal.  Our question is: What is the minimum required battery life?”  
  
Answer: There is no established minimum time for battery consumption/life. 

5) Question: “SMALL BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS: If the small business buys equipment from a large business, does this qualify for the small business set-aside?”  
 
Answer:  If step two is set aside for small businesses, in whole or in part, eligibility for participation in the set aside is limited to small businesses providing their own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern.  This answer is based on FAR 19.001 Nonmanufacturer rule copied below for ready reference as follows: 

“’Nonmanufacturer rule’ means that a contractor under a small business set-aside or 8(a) contract shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern (see 13 CFR 121.406). “


6) Question: “What  % maximum "foreign content" is acceptable in the end PRD product?”  

Answer:  Again, for a small business set aside, articles must be manufactured in the United States and the cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components as provided in FAR 25.101 (a) and (b) as follows:


“25.101 General
(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.
(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and
(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components.
(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.”

7) Question:  “Can the PRD be manufactured overseas and distributed by a large business here in the U.S. and still be acceptable?”

Answer:  As indicated in the answers to questions 5 and 6, this would not be acceptable under a small business set aside.  However, if the procurement is not set aside for small business, the price of a foreign product would be evaluated as provided by the Buy American Act and any applicable trade agreements through FAR 25.105 Determining reasonableness of cost as follows:

“25.105 Determining reasonableness of cost. 
(a) The contracting officer- 
(1) Must use the evaluation factors in paragraph (b) of this section unless the head of the agency makes a written determination that the use of higher factors is more appropriate. If the determination applies to all agency acquisitions, the agency evaluation factors must be published in agency regulations; and 
(2) Must not apply evaluation factors to offers of eligible products if the acquisition is subject to a trade agreement under Subpart 25.4. 
(b) If there is a domestic offer that is not the low offer, and the restrictions of the Buy American Act apply to the low offer, the contracting officer must determine the reasonableness of the cost of the domestic offer by adding to the price of the low offer, inclusive of duty- 
(1) 6 percent, if the lowest domestic offer is from a large business concern; or 
(2) 12 percent, if the lowest domestic offer is from a small business concern. The contracting officer must use this factor, or another factor established in agency regulations, in small business set-asides if the low offer is from a small business concern offering the product of a small business concern that is not a domestic end product (see Subpart 19.5). 
(c) The price of the domestic offer is reasonable if it does not exceed the evaluated price of the low offer after addition of the appropriate evaluation factor in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. (See evaluation procedures at Subpart 25.5.) “

 
8)Question: “The PRD shall detect radiation equal to or greater than 1.5 counts per second per microrem/hour calibrated for 662 keV gamma photons due to 137Cs. PRDs that detect neutrons, shall have a sensitivity 0.5 counts/sec per neutron/sec/cm2.  We suspect that "equal to or greater than" was accidentally left out of the second sentence relating to neutron sensitivity. Could you please check on this for us.”

Answer:  The writer is correct.  The second sentence of specification paragraph 5.2 is changed to read:  PRDs that detect neutrons shall have a sensitivity "equal to or greater than" 0.5 counts/second per neutron/sec/cm2.


9)Question: “Do only US resident vendors and manufacturers may participate in this procurement?”

Answer:    See answers to questions 5, 6 and 7.  We add that should there be a small business set aside for step 2,  the answer to this question about residency lies in the 
FAR Part 19  Small Business programs definition of a “Concern”.  FAR 19.001 defines “Concern” as follows:

"’Concern’ means any business entity organized for profit (even if its ownership is in the hands of a nonprofit entity) with a place of business located in the United States or its outlying areas and that makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes and/or use of American products, material and/or labor, etc. "Concern" includes but is not limited to an individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association, or cooperative. For the purpose of making affiliation findings (see 19.101), include any business entity, whether organized for profit or not, and any foreign business entity, i.e., any entity located outside the United States and 
its outlying areas.”


10)Question: “Do we understand correctly, that measuring of the ambient dose in the range from 10 to 3600 microrem/hour is done using Cs-137 source (p.4.1.9.)?”

Answer: Paragraph 4.1.9 clearly states that the ambient radiation levels from 10 to 3600 microrem/hr will be measured by using the 662 keV photons from Cs-137.

11) Question:  “Instruments can have identical sensitivity (p.5.2) and identical threshold (4.1.13), but will detect the same sources during different interval of time. Will this parameter tested and if yes what is the methodology of tests of detection capabilities under 4.1.9?”

Answer:  The time to alarm (the interval or duration of time required by the radiation pager to give a full indication of the radiation level) will be measured by increasing the radiation level of the Cs-137 from background to 50 microrem/hr by using a fast opening shutter.  The shutter will open fully within 0.5 seconds.   A stop watch will be used to measure the time to alarm.   The time to alarm for gamma rays should not be more than 2 seconds. 

12) Question:  “What radiation source will be used for test of neutron channel? Is it Cf-252 as of ANSI N42.32? Will be phantom used during test of sensitivity of the unit to the neutron radiation as of ANSI N42.32?”

Answer:  A Cf-252 source and a 30 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm polymethylacrylate phantom will be used to measure the detection of neutrons.

13) Question:  “According to p.4.1.13, neutron threshold of PRD should be set to 2 neutron/cm2/sec. If this threshold is exceeded, during what period of time alarm shall start?”

Answer:  The time to alarm, as described for the gamma rays above, should not be greater than 2 seconds.

14)Question:   “After studying specifications, we found several models which have perfect fit.  However in the documents there are no restrictions on the number of the PRD models that should be provided for testing. Is it acceptable that two PRD models will be provided for each type by one offeror? For example, two models of gamma or gamma/neutron type.”

Answer: The solicitation specified two units for each test which the responding company wants to offer. This means two (gamma only) units for the gamma only tests and two (Gamma/Neutron) units for the gamma neutron test, providing the responding company offers both products. For companies that make more than one model of the Gamma only or the Gamma/Neutron units and wish to have said units tested they should provide two units of each model. 

15)Question:  “At present we produce the gamma only and gamma/neutron pagers in original housings of the same size. The housings have conventionalized local bulge in the upper part for convenience of use when taking PRD out from its holder. See the picture in the attachment. The housing dimension in the place of the local bulge slightly exceed the dimension indicated in specifications for gamma only pager but considerably smaller than dimensions for gamma/neutron pager. The specifications
specify "the optimum dimensions" for gamma only pager 1"x 3" x 5"(+/-10%). Do we understand correctly that this is not a strict requirement and the presence of extension parts on the housing which exceed the size by 0.17" in one direction will not cause rejection of the offer? Or is it possible to revise the specifications and increase this size, for example, up to 1,2"  We can submit for testing the same gamma only pager made in another standard rectangular housing which would formally meet the requirements 1"x3"x5" (+/-10%). However, we think that it would be more convenient for CBP to have gamma only and
gamma/neutron PRDs in unified housings - it would simplify training procedures, maintenance, repair, interchangeability of accessories.”

Answer: The specification describes the OPTIMUM size for the product not to specify any particular "must have" dimensions. All products submitted shall be considered if not grossly outside these parameters.

16)Question:  “Do you require the battery power saving search button on both the gamma and gamma neutron units, or is a battery power saving search button only required on the gamma-only unit ? (See section 4.1.10)”
 
Answer: The ability to search for the greatest intensity of an emitting source(s) shall be designed into both types of PRDs. 
 
17)Question:  “Do you require an exposure rate reading in uR/hour or is a number equivalency chart sufficient (see section 4.1.9)?”
  
Answer:  An equivalency chart, that delineates the exposure rate equivalence of the LED display is acceptable.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  Interested parties should view the RFQ document which has been uploaded separately for all the details and instructions.  

The U.S. Department of Education is in search of a commercially available, existing workforce Data Management system.  The system is required to support the management and monitoring of employment data.  The objective is to provide a system that allows the Equal Employment Opportunity Group the continued capability to conduct quarterly, annual and special requested employment assessments involving racial, ethnic, age and gender composition, and representation of individuals with disabilities of relevant occupational and employment categories within ED's workforce.

There is no such thing as "the best" Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) data management or Affirmative Action Planning (AAP) software.  But there are probably several that suit one organization's specific needs.  The goal is to match one software product to ED's EEOG.  ED reserves the right to request demonstrations of the proposed product/software. 

Responses are due at 12:00pm EST on September 27, 2004.

<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is seeking an industry partner(s) for participation in the Jupiter Magnetospheric Explorer (JMEX) mission.  This mission has been proposed in response to NASA Announcements of Opportunity (AO's) AO-03-OSS-02 for the SMEX program.  See Exhibits A, and B for details, (summary, offer format/instructions, evaluation factors, background, JMEX Mission Description, and Primary Mirror Overview – Exhibit A, and Secondary Mirror Overview – Exhibit B).   It is likely that primary selection of the Jupiter Magnetospheric Explorer Mission under the AO and the availability of funds would result in a contract.  GSFC plans to select a partner(s) using the following steps: 1) issue the Partnership Opportunity Document, which includes a mission overview of  JMEX, and instructions about how to respond to this partnership opportunity;  2) receive presentation packages from interested Partnership Opportunity Document respondents; 3)  review written presentations; and  4) evaluate written presentations.	 The Goddard Space Flight Center JMEX team has already submitted its Step 2 proposal to the Small Explorer Program Announcement of Opportunity (A.O.) AO-03-OSS-02.  The team is now looking for a partner to participate in the development, fabrication, testing, etc. of a primary and secondary mirror, should the team’s Step 2 be successful under this A.O.  If the team’s JMEX proposal is to be selected by the A.O. source selection official as a primary or secondary mission, Goddard intends to negotiate a contract with its primary mirror partner to execute the mission as described in the source selection official’s selection documentation. This solicitation/synopsis includes a "Partnership Opportunity Document" (POD) for the primary and secondary mirrors.	The Partnership Opportunity Document does not represent a guarantee of selection for hardware development.  GSFC does not currently have a requirement for this mission or funds available to support its development.  In responding to this notice please reference "Jupiter Magnetospheric Explorer".  This solicitation/synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information	provided by any prospective partners.  An ombudsman has been appointed.   This notice constitutes all information concerning the JMEX requirement that will be furnished at this time.  Interested firms should submit their notice of intent by September 24, 2004 to Jennifer J. Awkard, NASA/GSFC, Mail Code 210.3, Bldg 11, Rm S215G, Greenbelt, MD 20771, or e-mail: Jennifer.J.Awkard@nasa.gov. All Partnership Opportunity Document respondents shall deliver their complete proposal packages to Jennifer Awkard at the above address no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on October 4, 2004. Documents, comments, and questions may be forwarded to Jennifer Awkard via electronic transmission or by facsimile transmission (301-286-1720).  When responding reference the RFI number (JMEX-RFI-09-24-04).  The documents for this partnership opportunity will be in Microsoft Office 2000 Suite (Word 2000, Excel 2000, or PowerPoint 2000) format and will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey for the Blended Metal Technology Integrated Product Team (BMT/IPT) to gain preliminary market research information into the availability and capability of existing blended metal technology in relationship to the manufacture of small arms ammunition projectiles.  The results of this sources sought will be used in potential future research and development efforts to enhance small arms ammunition external ballistic performance by the incorporation of blended metal technology projectiles.  A description of Blended Metal Technology Projectiles is outlined below: 1.0  Background 1.1  Conventional lead core, full metal jacket rifle projectiles, such as those used by the US military, consists of a gilding metal jacket and a lead core.  The gilding metal used in the jacket typically consists of cupronickel, cupro-zinc, cupro-tin or in some cases pure copper.  The projectile core is not pure lead.  The core typically consists of lead mixed with antimony or tin.  The hardness and brittleness of the lead core is controlled by the amount of antimony or tin added.  The lead used in the core is melted and the desired amount of antimony or tin is added to the molten lead. 1.2  The intent of this document is not to provide a total list of all metals used to form a conventional FMI projectile.  This description is given with the intent to provide a brief explanation of what is considered a typically lead FMI projectile.  With the description of a typical FMI projectile established, we can establish what the blended metal technology integrated product team considers a “blended metal technology” projectile. 2.0  Blended Metal Technology Projectile 2.1  Within the past 10-15 years, many different manufacturers have developed projectiles which utilize cores manufactured with materials other than lead, using processes other than melting.  The base metals used in these formulations are usually a very fine powder.  Copper, tungsten, and brass are examples of some of the base powdered metals used to date.  These powdered metals are mixed with a binder such as tin, zinc, or a polymer such as nylon.  Once the powdered metal(s) and binder(s) are mixed, they are pressed or molded into the final projectile core form, and in some cases sintered. 2.2  The description of a blended metal technology projectile would then be any projectile manufactured from a mix of powdered metals and binders which are blended and then pressed or molded into the desired form or shape. This document does not intend to specify or in any way limit the manufacturing process or materials used.  The intent of this document is simply to describe what the blended metal technology integrated product team considers to be the technical description of a blended metal technology small arms projectile, as opposed to a conventional FMI lead core projectile.  The results of this sources sought announcement will be compiled into a database of potential sources for test sample quantity procurements.  Test samples will be evaluated against existing projectile exterior ballistic performance (accuracy, hard target penetration, terminal performance), compatibility with gun lubricants, solvents, and insect repellant, temperature stability.   This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicit! ation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  All interested sources are encouraged to submit information to NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane by close of business 18 October 2004. Questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Code 1162, Bldg. 2521, NAVSURFWARCENDIV, Crane, IN 47522, telephone (812) 854-1988, or e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement

SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT FOR ONE (1) Modernization Upgrade to existing Avtron K400B Generator Test Stand. 

DESC: INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT WITH Avtron Manufacturing, Inc.  The Air Force, Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Avtron Manufacturing, Inc, 7900 E. Pleasant Valley Road, Independence, OH 44131.  The Sole Source purchase will be for the following one (1) commercial item: 

MODEL:	K400B-XL Modernization Upgrade
Description:	Replacement Control Console (based upon Avtron K938 design) with modern computer and software platform.  Avtron ATE++ System software with full automatic, semi-automatic and manual control capability.  New AC Load Bank PLC Module and Serial Communication Module.  New Avtron ADDvantage-32 Digital Drive Control with SCR Power Supply (550 A) and Serial Communication Mode.  New Test Stand PLC Module, Instrumentation Module, and Serial Communication Module.  Complete Data Package (manuals and drawings).  Installation manual/data.  Two weeks on-site start-up and training.

Avtron Manufacturing designed and fabricated the original existing K400B test stands that now require a modernization upgrade.  The original test stands are no longer supportable in their current configuration and are old enough that repair parts, for the most part, are no longer available.  Additionally, the electronic controls have been supplanted by several generations of new technology.  The nature of the equipment and its intended usage make it unique and not commonly available.  This upgrade will replace the control console with modern computer technology and software platform, new control capabilities, new communication modules, new instrumentation modules, complete data package, and on site start up training. Avtron controls all the necessary design specifications, drawings, and materials lists, as well as the technical expertise to modify/upgrade the existing stand (K400B) into the new K400B-XL (extended life) configuration.  Avtron Manufacturing in Independence, Ohio is the only known source that can satisfy the requirements of the Government at this time.

Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the one (1) K400B Modernization Upgrade.   Responses may be sent via e-mail to jeff.gillespie@edwards.af.mil or mailed to AFFTC/PKDB, 5 South Wolfe Ave, Edwards AFB, CA 93524-1185, Attention: Jeff Gillespie.  Fax Number: 661-275-9633.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  If the office has not received any affirmative written responses by Close of Business (COB), 23 Sep 04, a Sole Source purchase order will be pursued with Avtron Manufacturing, Inc, 7900 E. Pleasant Valley Road, Independence, OH 44131.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR HOLLOW LENSING DUCTS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR HOLLOW LENSING DUCTS


Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), wants to license the technology to build Hollow Lensing Ducts.

Researchers at LLNL have developed a Hollow Lensing Duct which is especially useful for coupling pump light from laser diodes arrays into solid state laser amplifiers, such as doped rods, slabs, or fibers.  The Hollow Lensing Duct condenses and intensifies light by focusing the light with a spherical or cylindrical lens followed by reflective waveguiding. The Hollow Lensing Duct tapers down from a wide input side to a narrow output side, with the input side consisting of a lens that may be coated with an antireflective coating for more efficient transmission into the duct. The inside surfaces of the hollow lens duct are appropriately coated to be reflective, preventing light from escaping by reflection as it travels along the duct (reflective waveguiding). The hollow duct has various applications for intensifying light, such as in the coupling of diode array pump light to solid state lasing materials.

This technology is covered in U.S. Patent #6,160,934.   

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Hollow Lensing Duct should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  83-04

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Hollow Lensing Duct.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.104, Personal Services Contracts (Public Law 103-322, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriation Act, Title II, September 30, 1994, 108 Stat. 2530, as implemented by 25 U.S.C. 1638c).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price performance based commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-04-047-BAC to acquire Rheumatology Services.

The standards of medical practice and duties of the contractor shall be determined pursuant to the Medical Staff By-laws and Rules and Regulations, applicable provisions of law, other rules and regulations of any and all governmental authorities relating to licensure and regulation of physicians and hospital, and the standards and recommendations of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).  All contract physicians shall be required to participate in a hospital based quality improvement program which is consistent with current JCAHO requirements for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of their quality and appropriateness of care.  Medical services shall be performed by the contract physician upon award of temporary privileges in accordance with Crow Service Unit and Billings Area IHS Credentialing Policies until professional staff membership and the Indian Health Service Governing Body has granted clinical privileges in writing.    Temporary privileges are a prerequisite to performance, but ultimately, under the resultant contract, the Contract Physician performing the services must be privileged  in accordance with the Indian Health Service policy.  Therefore, compliance with the Indian Health Service privileging requirements is essential in the performance of the contract.  Any failure to comply with IHS privileging requirements shall be considered to be nonperformance of the contract.  The Governing Body will not grant clinical privileges until it is determined that credentials information has been verified.  Exceptions to the Indian Health Service credentialing review and clinical privilege process will not be considered.  The contractor’s failure to submit a successful application shall not excuse nonperformance of contract requirements.  Any contract physician who fails to maintain medical staff appointment and clinical privileges will not be permitted to perform services under this personal services contract and shall be terminated.  The contract physician shall be primarily required to perform Rheumatology consultant services.  The contractor shall also provide medical expertise to the active members of the Medical Staff at Crow PHS Indian Hospital and provide 1 or more CME presentation in their field of expertise to staff at this facility during the course of the contract.

The contractor shall become familiar with the Indian Health Service formulary.  The contractor shall follow Indian Health Service procedures when prescribing drugs.  Physicians authorized to prescribe pharmaceuticals shall do so according to the availability of drugs listed in the IHS formulary.

The contract physician shall maintain standards of personal hygiene and grooming such that his/her image as a physician is compatible with the exceptions of the Indian Health Service clinical staff and the Indian community.  To assure that physicians providing services under all personal service contracts are properly licensed and that the IHS is aware of any disciplinary actions, which may have been taken against them, the Contractor shall:  Verify through the Federation of State Medical Boards database all licenses, active, inactive, and lapsed that a physician providing services under this contract  may hold or have held;  Inform IHS of the status of all licenses, including the reasons for inactive or lapsed licenses; Obtain at least three letters of reference from other health care providers familiar with the candidate’s clinical practice skills.

This information shall be provided to the Crow PHS Indian Hospital Credentialing Coordinator no fewer than 15 working days prior to the physician’s projected date of arrival at the facility.  In emergency situations, which should be a rare occurrence when providing consultant services, where there is no time available, a telephone call from the Contract physician’s permanent place of employment providing assurances of the above is acceptable.

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
FOR
MUDCATS SPECTRACK
DATA ITEM DESCRIPTION
  DEVELOPMENT


1.0 SCOPE AND PURPOSE

The purpose of this procurement is to create the documentation and tools necessary to generate a Data Item Description (DID) for Air Force Primary Standards and Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) procurements.  The Air Force Metrology and Calibration Program uses the SpecTrack software application, part of the Edison Mudcats Metrology Suite, to manage technical specifications for Air Force TMDE.  The AFMETCAL Det1 engineering staff extracts and interprets TMDE specifications published in equipment manufacturer’s technical manuals or Air Force Technical Orders.  The engineering staff enters these specifications into a custom Oracle database with SpecTrack.  The specifications are maintained in the SpecTrack database and used for the authoring and production of Air Force technical orders.  The intent of this procurement is to develop the necessary technical data and tools to permit electronic submission of the requisite technical data directly from the equipment manufacturers during equipment procurement actions.

2.0 OBJECTIVE

The objective of this procurement is to obtain the documentation necessary to create a DID defining the file format specification for a Mudcats SpecTrack data import file.  The DID development process is specified in “Department of Defense Standard Practice Data Item Descriptions (DIDs)”, MIL-STD-963B, 31 August 1997.  The objective of this procurement does not include development of the final DID governing submission of SpecTrack compatible data files.  However, the reference to MIL-STD-963B is provided to assist in creating documentation which can be incorporated into a DID with minimal reformatting.   

3.0 REQUIREMENTS 
Development of the SpecTrack format specification has been divided into three phases.  Phase 1 covers development of SpecTrack format documentation compatible with the current version of SpecTrack installed at AFMETCAL Det1, version 1.2.0.  Phase 2 covers development of a software tool which AFMETCAL Det1 can provide to an equipment manufacturer to facilitate generation and validation of a SpecTrack compatible data file.  Phase 3 covers update of the documentation and software tool to support developmental changes in SpecTrack.
 3.1  PHASE 1 DOCUMENTATION   Phase 1 will document the format and content requirements necessary to produce a properly structured SpecTrack data import (msf) file compatible with SpecTrack version 1.2.0.  The documentation shall include the extensible markup language (XML) tag definitions, tag structure, permissible tag elements, and required tag elements for a SpecTrack data import file.  The value type and maximum data length for each element shall be identified.  Any restrictions on values such as a limited range of values or an enumerated list of possible values shall be identified.  The specific list of allowed values shall be documented for each enumerated list.  A minimum of one sample SpecTrack data file shall be documented.  The sample shall show the specifications for an instrument as they would normally appear in the manufacturer’s technical manual together with the equivalent SpecTrack data file.  The sample shall include at least one complex specification containing multiple parameters for a range, i.e., AC Voltage includes both voltage amplitude and frequency specifications.  The final documentation shall be provided in a format compatible with Microsoft Word.

3.2 PHASE 2 SOFTWARE TOOL

The objective of Phase 2 is the development of a software tool which can be provided to individual equipment manufacturers to support the creation of a SpecTrack data import file.  The software tool shall present a graphical user interface that leads the equipment manufacturer through the creation of a properly formatted SpecTrack data import file.  The software tool shall implement all constraints necessary to assure generation of a valid SpecTrack data import file.  The contractor shall develop user documentation with sufficient clarity to obviate formal user training.  User documentation shall include both a user manual and on-line help system.  It is anticipated this software tool would have much of the look and feel of the SpecTrack data entry application without database support functions.  The preferred distribution package is a self-contained Windows software application that can be freely distributed to equipment manufacturers for the express purpose of generating SpecTrack data import files with no license restrictions.  A possible alternative is a web based client application that can be freely distributed with no license restrictions that interfaces with a licensed server at AFMETCAL Det1.  

3.3 PHASE 3 SYSTEM UPDATE

Phase 3 will update the Phase 1 SpecTrack documentation and Phase 2 software tool to support changes in the SpecTrack specification due to version upgrades.  This phase will document the format and content requirements necessary to produce a properly structured SpecTrack data import file compatible with the SpecTrack revisions, and update the software tool to support these changes.  This includes SpecTrack software changes which introduce structural changes in the SpecTrack data import file structure as well as changes in data limits and constraints.  The documentation shall include the XML tag definitions, tag structure, permissible tag elements, and required tag elements for a SpecTrack data import file.  The value type and maximum data length for each element shall be identified.  Any restrictions on values such as a limited range of values or an enumerated list of possible values shall be identified.  The specific list of allowed values shall be documented for each enumerated list.  A minimum of one sample SpecTrack data file shall be documented.  The sample shall show the specifications for an instrument as they would normally appear in the manufacturer’s technical manual together with the equivalent SpecTrack data file.  The sample shall include at least one complex specification containing multiple parameters for a range, i.e., AC Voltage includes both voltage amplitude and frequency specifications.  The sample specification shall include an example of each specification element that has undergone structural changes from SpecTrack version 1.2.0.  The final documentation shall be provided in a format compatible with Microsoft Word.  The software tool shall be updated to produce a SpecTrack data import file compatible with these changes.

4.0	REVIEWS, MEETINGS, AND REPORTS

The contractor shall provide written monthly status updates to AFMETCAL Det1 during each phase of the project.  Project updates may be submitted in contractor format.  Updates shall include a summary of progress to date, anticipated problems, and expected completion date.  Technical interchange meetings (TIM) shall be conducted as necessary between the contractor and AFMETCAL Det1 personnel to assess the project progress and resolve technical issues.  The TIMs can be held at the contractor facility, at AFMETCAL Det1, or via teleconference as necessary.  The contractor shall provide AFMETCAL Det1 draft copies of the documentation product for review and approval two weeks prior to phase completion.    

For Phase 2, a preliminary design review shall be conducted at AFMETCAL Det1 to evaluate the technical adequacy, compatibility with the requirements, licensing arrangements, and risk resolution of the selected design approach for the software tool.  A final system review will be conducted at AFMETCAL Det1 to evaluate and approve the completed software tool.  The contractor shall provide AFMETCAL Det1 draft copies of the user documentation and a test version of the software tool for review and approval two weeks prior to the final system review.    

5.0	SCHEDULE



Phase 1:  The contractor shall generate a schedule for the development and completion of this phase of the project at the beginning of the phase.  This schedule will be adopted subject to mutual agreement of the contractor and AFMETCAL Det1representatives.  This phase shall be completed not later than six months after initial contract award.

Phase 2:  The contractor shall generate a schedule for the development and completion of this phase of the project at the beginning of the phase.  This schedule will be adopted subject to mutual agreement of the contractor and AFMETCAL Det1representatives.

Phase 3:  It is recognized that this phase of the project is subject to the completion of final design for the SpecTrack revisions.  The contractor shall generate a schedule for the development and completion of this phase of the project at the beginning of the phase.  This schedule will be adopted subject to mutual agreement of the contractor and AFMETCAL Det1representatives.

6.0  LICENSES

The contractor shall grant an unrestricted right to use the documentation generated in this project to prepare a DID for the express purpose of TMDE procurements within the Department of Defense (DOD).  This DID will be distributable without restriction to all contractors competing for DOD procurements.  The contractor shall grant AFMETCAL Det1a license to use and redistribute any software tool developed during Phase 2/3 of this project for the express purpose of generating a SpecTrack data import file.  Any fees associated with this license shall be included in the development cost of the software tool.

<DESC>Answers to contractor questions:----------



Questions:
1. What is the application you will be using the equipment for? V-Brick, cable TV distribution to PCs connected to the Lan-------
2. Is it for a satellite master antenna TV (S.M.A.T.V., Multi Dwelling Units' (M.D.U), Private Offices or a Public Viewing areas? Not sure what this is-Lt Tydinco, can you address based on the information you received from Vbrick.com?---------
3. You have requested a 16 way multi switcher but only have need for a 4-way. How many channel do you wish the system to have and what programming would you like? 4 channels (CNN, WX channel, Fox News, Commanders Access Channel)--------
4. Are you adding to an existing system? No----------
DirecTV has different application for different situations and needs. 
Your request appears to be for a SMATV rack that will be used to provide signal to multiple locations but does not include any modulators to assign the channel, nor is wire included with your request. I also noted you are only requesting three receivers. For an S.M.A.TV system this would only provide you with a three-channel system. Not sure what SMATV is- our solution is the V-brick solution which will use dual channel encoders to send out the signals to the PCs on the network    (In cold weather climates e recommend a heating element that is connected to the dish for the winter months.)
5. What type of viewing, public or private?  This acqusition will be used for viewing in public common areas.------------
6. What is WX channel?  WX channel is the weather channel.-------------
7. What is SMATV? Basically SMATV is DirecTV fancy speak for when you have one single master dish that sends signals out to multiple locations.-------------
 
8. Why are three recievers needed?  Three recievers are needed because we will get the Commander's Access Feed from Comcast rather from DirecTV. The 16-way switch is a good idea because even though we are initially getting only 4 channels, it leaves room for expansion. Remember you can hook any video signal into the system, not just DirecTV feeds.-------------


Comment:  The antena will be installed on the side of building 203 on Dover, Air Force Base.  The antena can be secured the buildings brick exterior.
