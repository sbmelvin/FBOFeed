In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
New/Unused or New/Reconditioned Government Surplus may be considered.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.

However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC at One Zeiss Drive; Thornwood, NY 10594 for the purchase of a Carl Zeiss VivaTome Demo system with AxioObserver Z1 demo system.</p>
<p>The Carl Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 with VivaTome is equipped with Colibri Set-Up for live imaging which is pioneering technology for high-resolution, light-efficient imaging of highly dynamic processes. Called VivaTome, the technology combines the speed of a spinning disk with the light efficiency of structural illumination, resulting in rapid frame rates that allow the capture of fast processes in living samples. VivaTome uses a white light source instead of lasers which makes it very gentle for living cell imaging and also economical and maintenance-reducing. The Carl Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 with VivaTome technology is also equipped for live imaging and is supported by Carl Zeiss' new technology, ZEN software, which operates on a 64-bit platform leading to extremely fast acquisition and storage of large datasets. System consists of the high performance LED source, called Colibri, which allows for variable adjustment of intensity and wavelength excitation.</p>
<p>Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC is the sole manufacturer of the Carl Zeiss Vivatome with AxioObserver Z1 and is the only known source that will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures using FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2358889, may be submitted to the NIDA Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions Branch; 31 Center Drive, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59; Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080 to the attention of Hunter A.

The EPA Brownfield program is authorized under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42. U.S.C. 9601 et eq.) as amended by the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act signed January 11, 2002, (Public Law 107-118).  The EPA?s Brownfields Program is designed to empower states, communities and other stakeholders in economic redevelopment to work together in a timely manner to prevent, assess, safely clean-up and sustain the reuse of Brownfields.
A Brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant and may include properties contaminated by petroleum, controlled substances and mine scarred land. The EPA Brownfields Program provides financial and technical assistance for Brownfields activities through an approach based on four main goals:  (1) Protecting the Environment; (2) Promoting Partnerships; (3) Strengthening the Marketplace; and (4) Sustaining Reuse.

A DRAFT SOW is posted on the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/hcsc/brownfield/presolsow.pdf. 
This procurement will be a full and open competition, processed using FAR Part 15.  The EPA anticipates award of at least three fixed rate indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts from this solicitation. The contract period of performance shall be for five years. The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620 ? Environmental Consulting Services, with applicable size standard of $7 million.

Information related to this procurement including any subsequent procurement notifications will be posted here on the Federal Business Opportunities website at:  http://www.fbo.gov and the EPA website at: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/. 
It is estimated that the solicitation will be available on or about January 2012.  THE EPA WILL NOT ISSUE A PAPER SOLICITATION.  If you have any questions regarding this notice please contact (by e-mail only) the Contract Specialist.  No facsimile or telephonic responses will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:</span></strong> <br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for market research purposes issued by the C/KC-135 Contracting Branch, OC-ALC/GKCK at Tinker Air Force Base (TAFB). The United States Air Force (USAF) is requesting information on a Boom Drogue Assembly (BDA) Soft Basket Upgrade for the C/KC-135 aircraft fleet.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />PURPOSE:<br /></span></strong>The C/KC-135 Aircraft Sustainment Branch Contracting Office (GKC/GKCK), Tinker AFB OK, is conducting market research to determine estimated cost of developing and integrating a soft basket on the BDA which will take the place of the legacy BDA basket NSN (1680-00-971-4099).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY:<br /></span></strong>This RFI is issued solely for informational and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>The Government requests that non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. However, should proprietary information be submitted, it should be marked "PROPRIETARY", and will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:<br /></span></strong>The KC-135 aircraft is commonly used today for USAF strategic missions. Joint Operations with U.S. services and NATO countries require the United States Air Force to provide aerial refueling via probe and drogue systems that are referenced within Figure 1 of the attached. Two drogue systems are utilized by the Air Force. The boom drogue adapter is attached to the boom and trails behind the aircraft. The current rigid BDA, as reflected in Figure 1, has routinely caused damage to U.S. and NATO aircraft. Another probe and drogue capability is provided by the Multi Pont Refueling System (MPRS) installed on 20 KC-135s. This fleet of 20 aircraft is in high demand. To alleviate this burden on MPRS fleet and to facilitate today's mission without further damaging U.S. and NATO aircraft, the Air Force will require industry to integrate a soft basket to replace the metal basket on the legacy BDA.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;RESPONSE:<br /></span></strong><br />Responses shall address:</p>
<p>1. Developmental schedule (duration from contract award to on aircraft test completion)</p>
<p>2. Estimated developmental cost (i.e. nonrecurring engineering and technical data)</p>
<p>3. A Kit Cost break out (208 baskets in all)</p>
<p>4. The components/methods proposed to be replaced or modified</p>
<p>5. Description and rational of proposed system capabilities and operation</p>
<p>6. Details of proposed replacement components/methods to include, but not limited to, items such as airworthiness certification (MIL-HDBK-516B), current usage on other systems or in development, logistics support requirements/availability/reliability/maintainability (parts supply, spares, repair, support equipment, tech data, training, pro and cons etc.)</p>
<p>7. Component lead times (longest lead time only for each system is required)</p>
<p>8. Past Performance: Briefly explain any previous work you have done or are doing for military/civilian customers similar to what this RFI addresses (include demonstration information that supported that work)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Additionally, please note the following as you consider your response:</strong></span></p>
<p>Services are to include research and development, technology insertions, system integrations, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support, logistic support services, and engineering support. Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrade and operational support costs.<br /><br />The information you provide may be used by the USAF to consider planning, program phasing and tailored technical requirements. Your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any manner. Although the identification of contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information that is received as a result of this RFI. Your participation in the RFI will not affect your company's position during any solicitation, nor will this RFI be used as criteria for the prequalification of respondents for future solicitations.</p>
<p>Through this RFI the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature or emerging technologies which meet the requirements.

<SUBJECT>Benchmarking Capabilities for Federal Government Financial Management

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
<p>Survey to Benchmarking Vendors</p>
<p>Benchmarking Capabilities for Federal Government Financial Management</p>
<p>Through the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Innovation and Transformation (FIT), the Federal government will assist Federal shared service providers by identifying agencies that would benefit from transferring their financial management functions to shared service capabilities. An initial focus of this initiative will be the activities associated with benchmarking the current financial management capabilities of the various shared service providers. These activities include, but are not limited to, the efficiency and effectiveness of the transactions managed in accounts payable, accounts receivable, general ledger, budget execution, funds management, cost accounting, fixed asset accounting, internal audit activities and financial statement audit activities. The effort would compare the financial management operations of the major shared service providers. No such data currently exists for the shared service providers to compare their performance against one another or other Federal agencies. Additionally, while the high-level data is standard across the providers (for OMB reporting), the more granular data required to benchmark at a transaction level is not currently standardized to make a comparison between the providers meaningful. For example, the definition of "audit costs" is not agreed upon and different providers could use very different factors to determine this cost.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to acquire market information about a commercial benchmarking tool the Federal government could potentially use to compare its shared service providers' financial management performance and capabilities with other providers as well as other Federal agencies. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation for goods and services. Please note that no solicitation document is available at this time.</p>
<p>Responses should include past experience with Federal government financial management performance (including contract numbers, size of effort, length of contract, etc), pricing structures, benchmarking methodology (e.g., data focus vs. anecdotal approach), mechanisms for gathering data, how the data is shared or owned after benchmarking completion, and proposed administration strategy. Responses should also include how a solution would measure financial management performance to establish a baseline applicable governmentwide and how the solution would define and break down metrics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, responses should address the following questions:<br />&bull; How would you make your benchmarking solution relatable governmentwide? Specifically, how do you propose standardizing the data so that other agencies can compare their operations in a meaningful way?<br />&bull; Is your benchmarking tool specific to Federal financial management operations?<br />&bull; Does your tool incorporate the Financial Management Line of Business effort to standardize business processes across financial management?<br />&bull; To what level does your tool measure performance (e.g., bureau or department)?<br />&bull; Are there any proprietary constraints on using your benchmarking methodology and templates once the initial benchmarking is completed?<br />&bull; To what level is your tool customizable off the shelf?<br />&bull; Is the tool available on a Federal schedule? If yes, which schedule(s)?<br />&bull; Identify your business size classification (i.e., small, HUBZone, SDVOSB, 8(a), Woman-owned). <br />&bull; Who is a point of contact at your organization (i.e., name, phone, email address) that we can contact for further information?</p>
<p>The information gathered in response to this RFI will be provided to a third party Contractor unless the individual or company providing the response requests that it not be shared. The Government will require that any third party Contractor employees, preparing or reviewing the business case analysis, sign non-disclosure statements before receiving the information. In the event that the government decides to proceed with the acquisition of a tool, this RFI will not serve as a basis for an award decision and an official solicitation document will be developed.</p>
<p>Your response should be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than 01/06/2012. In your response, please reference RFI-ARC-12-0033 in the subject line. The following file extensions are not allowable and application materials/data submitted with these extensions cannot be considered: .bat, .cmd, .com, .exe, .pif, .rar, .scr, .vbs, .hta, .cpl, and .zip files. Microsoft Office compatible documents are acceptable.</p>
<p>Any questions related to this request for information shall be directed to the Contract Specialist or Contracting Officer in this notice. All questions must be sent to psb3@bpd.treas.gov no later than 12/19/2011. In your response, please reference RFI-ARC-12-0033 in the subject line. No contact shall be made to FIT staff.</p>

<DESC>Title:  Instrumentation Communication Subsystem (ICS) for the Home Station Instrumentation Training System (HITS) <br><br>Contract Vehicle: The requirement is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.<br><br>Closing Date: December 16th, 2011.<br><br>Scope of Market Survey:  HITS is comprised of two subsystems, a data processing and presentation subsystem known as Exercise control (EXCON), and an Instrumentation Communication Subsystem (ICS). This market survey is only applicable for the ICS. The EXCON subsystem is currently being procured via a separate contract. <br><br>EXCON System Description<br>Home Instrumentation Training Systems (HITS) is a training device that provides to U.S. Army units at their home stations many of the training enablers previously only available at the Maneuver Combat Training Centers. It is an integrated system of computer software and hardware; workstations; databases; voice, video, and data recording, production, and presentation equipment; interface devices; and communication networks. It provides the tools for the Observer/Controllers (O/C) and Operators to collect, analyze, and present training performance feedback to the training unit in the After Action Review (AAR) and Take Home Package (THP).  <br><br>ICS Description<br>The ICS consists of the communication infrastructure, Radio Frequency (RF) link, and/or ICS gateway to support HITS. The ICS provides the data interface and bidirectional communication network between the EXCON and vehicles and personnel equipped with Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (TESS) that are complaint to the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) standards. The ICS consists of light deployable communication infrastructure that can be rapidly assembled and disassembled, and transported to support field training exercises.  <br><br>Basic Scope of work for the ICS Potential Future Solicitation<br>This solicitation supports the HITS program in the Production and Deployment acquisition phase of the ICS subsystem requirement only.  No development will be funded by the Government.  This effort includes engineering implementation, engineering CDRLs focused on interfaces and design, production, Configuration Management, Technical Data Package and shipping of the network infrastructure and radio player units, individual and vehicle mounting kits, logistic data, spares manuals, New Equipment Training (NET), and system production support to third party companies to ensure the end to end solution is achieved. <br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The goal is to maximize the competitive base and determine the best acquisition strategy to leverage proven COTS and/or NDI communication infrastructure to the greatest extent possible in order to minimize engineering implementation.  The Government's intent is to procure a proven NDI and/or COTS data radio system with a supporting infrastructure that can meet the fundamental requirements below.  Of key interest to the Government are a mobile communication system infrastructure, a reliable Radio Frequency (RF) link, and gateway to support the Home Station Instrumentation System (HITS).   <br><br>The following are fundamental requirements that are anticipated to be found in a RFP:<br><br>A.	The prime contractor shall be responsible for furnishing an existing and proven RF infrastructure and working data communication RF link at a minimum to the base station and network controller/administrator workstation prior to GPS and MILES data interfacing to the gateway.    <br><br>B.	The prime contractor at a minimum shall comply with the software message protocol (sequence, timing, and format) electrical and mechanical interfaces as described in the MILES program ICDs and TESS ICD PRF-PT-00552, 14 Nov 2011 (REV B) between the radio and TESS vehicle Platform and manworn.  This can be done in house by the prime or subcontracted for the appropriate skill set. <br>  <br>C.	The prime contractor of the ICS gateway shall comply with PU   CTIA Common message set ICD, version 1.1.  The gateway transforms the messages from the Radio GPS and MILES between the Gateway and PU controller according to the PU   CTIA Common message set ICD, version 1.1. The PU controller and EXCON is a Government furnished collection of software.  <br><br>QUANTITIES:  The total number of systems is currently estimated to be approximately 19. The required fielding date for the First Unit Equipped (FUE) is currently projected to be 4Q13.

<RESPDATE>010412
<CONTACT>Matthew T. Gross, Phone 4105907051, Email matthew.t.gross@uscg.mil
<DESC>NOTE: Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation. No solicitation documents exist at this time. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers. Any information the Contractor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to provide assistance to the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in maintaining new power distribution systems. The USCG is requesting responses from all qualified concerns.
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USCG is acquiring a new fleet of 154' Patrol Boats with a sophisticated power distribution system consisting of the ship's service and emergency switchboards, all of their inputs, outputs and interfaces. It is anticipated that eighteen of these cutters will have home ports in Miami, Key West and San Juan, PR. These cutters are usually underway or ready to be underway, and require a power distribution maintenance system that performs both efficiently and effectively in order to meet mission readiness requirements.</p>
<p>The ships service and emergency switchboards are unique designs manufactured by the Robichaux Automation and Control, Incorporated (RAACI) for the Coast Guard. The switchboards control, monitor, and protect the ship's two service generators and the emergency generator. They also control and monitor the distribution of electrical power from the switchboard to the electrical systems on board the cutter. The switchboard's functions can be controlled manually or by using a unique programmable logic controller (PLC) based algorithm that has the capability to fully control all functions automatically.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE</p>
<p>The USCG would like industry's input and ideas for planning and executing maintenance on this power distribution system. We require a maintenance system that responds rapidly to system failures and also plans and executes preventative maintenance within stringent time constraints. We have identified high level maintenance requirements necessary to meet readiness requirements and would like industry's perspective on how best to meet these requirements.</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>a. Unscheduled Maintenance and Tech Reps</p>
<p>When a power distribution system failure occurs, the maintenance system must respond to correct the failure with parts and/or services. Services may be required to both trouble shoot problems and execute repairs. Based on the criticality of the failure, the cutter may require a response time as short as a few hours.</p>
<p>We would like to know if there are contractors located near cutter home ports who are qualified to perform technical services and execute repairs on these unique systems. To be considered qualified, contractors should show previous experience with similar systems, and demonstrate proficiency with Siemens PLC and Woodward EasyGen controllers.</p>
<p>We would like industry's ideas for meeting support requirements that may, or may not, be very critical with minimal logistics delay time. This includes providing both parts and services.</p>
<p>We would like industry's recommendations on how to determine which critical spare parts should be stored at cutter homeports.<br /><br />b. Scheduled Maintenance</p>
<p>The power distribution system OEM has prescribed very few time based preventative maintenance tasks. The Coast Guard's experience with these types of systems has shown that annual grooms are an effective means to perform preventative maintenance and reduce failures. These grooms typically include tasks like thermo graphic analysis, cleaning, testing and calibrating.</p>
<p>We would like industry's recommendations on what preventative maintenance should be performed to effectively reduce the risk of system failures.</p>
<p>We would like industry's ideas what should be included in system grooms and how they should be performed.</p>
<p>c. Bow Thruster Drive Control System</p>
<p>The Bow Thruster Drive Control system is also designed and manufactured by (RAACI) utilizing Siemens low voltage AC drive components. The requirements for technical services, maintenance, grooms and parts for this controller are similar to the requirements for switchboards.</p>
<p>We would like to know if there are contractors located near cutter home ports who are qualified to perform technical services and execute repairs on this drive control system.</p>
<p>We would like industry's recommendations for critical parts, maintenance and grooms that should be performed to effectively reduce the risk of failure.</p>
<p>4. RESPONSES</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall not exceed twenty (20) pages, including cover letter and contact information. Responses should include a proposal outlining the ideas and methods that respective vendors would utilize to accomplish the multiple requirements and tasks contained in this RFI. Also, citations of any similar power distribution work within the past 5 years may be included. Include contract number, short description, point of contact telephone number or e-mail address, and dollar amount.</p>
<p>Please submit an e-mail response to Matthew.t.gross@uscg.mil. After the USCG reviews the responses, a possible follow up via phone call or personal meeting with the respective vendors may be requested.</p>

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM ) to procure professional indexing services on a sole source basis from Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a continuing stream of indexed foreign articles from biomedical journals for inclusion of MEDLINE. The staff of the Institute of Medical Information, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAM), has performed over twenty years of indexing for NLM MEDLINE of biomedical journals published in China. The Staff of CAMS is uniquely qualified to perform this indexing based on their knowledge of the Chinese language; knowledge of Chinese medicine; and fully trained to perform MEDLINE indexing. CAM will be using their own copies of journals published in China, and using their own computer equipment and telecommunications system. Chinese Academy-trained staff will analyze journal articles for subject content and apply appropriate subject headings drawn from the NLM controlled thesaurus, MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), using the NLM's Web-based indexing system (to which NLM will provide access).
<p>Staff members of CAM trained in NLM MEDLINE indexing policy and have many years of satisfactory indexing performance. Use of this source will eliminate the need to train new indexers and supply NLM with Chinese language expertise. Indexing will be performed following the policies and rules specified in the NLM MEDLINE Indexing Manual and technical memoranda. The journal articles are highly technical in nature, and require subject knowledge of the biomedical sciences in order to perform adequate subject analysis and indexing.</p>
<p>The Contractor will index life science journal articles by applying Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) describing the content of each article, following procedures and <br />policies contained in established NLM guidelines, including the NLM Indexing Manual, MeSH annotations, and other NLM-generated indexing aids such as Technical <br />Memoranda or email updates. Indexers will use DCMS, the NLM Web-based online indexing system, to add subject headings to the online record for each article. Indexers will access the online record for each article and review the descriptive data provided (pagination, language, authors, author affiliation, and title). The major effort involves the intellectual analysis of the article for subject content and the application of appropriate subject headings, publication types, and qualifiers drawn from MeSH. DCMS contains many validation programs to detect real or potential errors. Indexers will respond to "Error" or "Warning" messages generated by the system.</p>
<p>This is procurement reflects a continuing partnership between NLM with the Chinese Academy. The Chinese Academy's unique position of experience and journal access and the experience of NLM with the indexing community through similar international agreements and three other US indexing contracts.</p>
<p>The resulting award term will be for the period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012 with two option years of 12-months each. The award type is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Purchase Order.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Par 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner (by response due date) which will be considered by NLM. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Alex Navas, Contracting Officer, Tel 301-435-4393.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Risk Assessment Research Laboratory (NRMRL), Water Supply and Resource Division, Microbial Contaminants Control Branch, intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), to  Applied Biosystems for reagents and biological media currently used in ongoing research.
The data resulting from the research will be used to help formulate health and risk guidelines for recreational water by the Office of Water and therefore must be accurate and consistent.  It is critical that the data be compatible in all methods, formats, error detection and validations with the current equipment and supplies utilized in the research.  The resulting sample analysis must be equivalent to analysis provided by the current equipment and reagents used in the ongoing research. Switching to reagents produced by other manufacturers would cause substantial duplication of services as work completed would need to be validated and at an additionally substantial cost.
The description of the items that meet the Government?s minimum requirements are as follows:  (1) taqman exogenous internal positive control reagents 5-pack, (2) taqman environmental master mix 2.0 offers accurate, real time pcr based pathogen detection in the presence of high levels of inhibitors, (3) microamp fast optical 96 well reaction plate with barcode 0.1ml, engineered to work with any fast realtime pcr systems, (4) microamp optical adhesive film, reduces the chance of well to well contamination and sample evaporation when applied to a microplate, (5) taqman universal pcr master mix, (6) custom taqman expression assays for relative quantification of RNA expression to perform RNA expression studies on any coding or non coding RNA in any organism.  
The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516.  The size standard for this code is $7 million.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to Garry A. Plear, Contract Specialist, at the office identified above, by e-mail plear.garry@epa.gov.   The technical documentation must establish that the reagents to be provided meets all requirements.  Anticipated award date will be in December  2011.  Documentation must be submitted to Garry A. Plear by 3:00 PM, December 14, 2011 in order to be considered by EPA.  
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to sole source a firm-fixed price contract to Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to continue completion of the late stages of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) study effort at the former Plum Brook Ordnance Works (PBOW).  <br><br>Approximately $20 million has been contracted to Shaw since 1997 and an additional $3.4 million is needed for completion.  Completion could extend another 5 years depending upon available funding. <br><br>Shaw has collected a vast library of information and has become the engineer of record for the PBOW project.  As such, they have the data collected and analyzed in their computer model, field knowledge gained during the many years and awareness of all agreements with owners and regulators in the past. <br><br>USACE has advised that FY12 contracts for continuing the CERCLA process at PBOW must be awarded during the first quarter.  If contracts are not awarded by that date, funding may not be available until FY13.  This would result in schedule slippage and additional costs to continue in the future at higher rates in an AE contract.  Shaw is currently in the field completing sampling and under contract to complete the remedial investigation phase for three sites. Continuation contracts for the feasibility study phase are needed for the remaining four of seven sites.  In order to complete the work, any other AE besides Shaw would require duplicative costs to review and/or rewrite sampling and analysis plans, site specific health and safety plans, and data collection and analysis.  Based on Shaw's current contract rates, it is estimated that $225,000 per study site would be required in addition to the new scoped effort.  This effort includes the extensive review of approximately 30 reference documents, previous Shaw characterization reports and risk assessments.  Also included are site visits and meetings, review and upload of analytical data and the geographic information system (GIS) data.  Shaw would only incur costs for the specific site continuation feasibility study completion phase.  <br><br>A new AE would need additional time to conduct the above reviews and verifications.  This would extend the project schedule and could possibly result in scheduled awards slipping into the next funding cycle. If the additional review/catch-up fees are added to the contract awards, the number of sites to be awarded each year could be reduced if adequate funds are not available.  For example, if the funding work plan includes $500,000 for a specific site and an additional fee to a new AE is added ($225,000), then the site when awarded would require more than the programmed estimate and might force another site to be slipped to the next FY because of funding constraints. Thus the project completion schedule is extended and the cost is increased. <br><br><br>This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature.  Please provide past performance and references regarding your ability to provide this service along with your Statement of Capability.  The Government will not award a contract based on the information received, nor reimburse participants for information they provide. Information provided is strictly voluntary.  Please email capability statements or proposals to Isaac.j.taylor@usace.army.mil.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored. Closing date for submission of capability statements or proposals is December 22, 2011 at 5:00 p.m. CST.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541330 with a small business size standard of $4.5M.<br><br><br>

<DESC>The Nashville District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intends to sole source a firm-fixed price contract to Shaw Environmental & Infrastructure, Inc, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii) to) to continue completion of feasibility study at the former West Virginia Ordnance Works (WVOW), which was started prior to 2005 and remains in dispute with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); completion of the five-year review report submitted in 2010 and not approved by the EPA; and continuing ground water sampling and a treatability study to evaluate the effects of enhanced  in-situ bioremediation to reduce nitroaromatics at the site .  Shaw will also provide expert services to USACE during the dispute resolution process for WVOW.  Fulfillment of the total minimum needs for WVOW are estimated at $1.5 million and could extend another 5 years.  <br>Approximately $30 million has been awarded to Shaw (IT) for investigations at the WVOW site since 1992.  During this time Shaw developed and utilized computer models specific to WVOW for analyzing ground water contamination.  The model evolved through several iterations to gain approval from USACE and the EPA.  The model has been used to evaluate data collected each year to forecast the level of existing contamination from the previous manufacturing of trinitrotoluene (TNT).  All documents and publications produced by Shaw as contract deliverables are Government property and can be made available but only represent a small percent of the data necessary to complete the project analysis with any reasonable efficiency.  The documents represent summaries of information developed by Shaw through data collection and testing and have been submitted to regulators.  The documents summarize the results for presentation and do not reflect the entire computer analysis and human interpretation behind them.<br>In order to complete the work, any other AE besides Shaw would have to perform extensive reviews of all previous investigations and project team agreements to obtain the knowledge Shaw has gained from these investigations and interface with the regulators.  It is estimated that 1000 hours would be required by a new AE to establish the computer model for groundwater and possible computer system modifications as well.  There are 18 years of annual ground water monitoring data which would have to be incorporated into the model.  The total cost of the modeling effort would vary based on the capability of another AE's system.  As the engineer of record, the new AE would have to review all previous reports, records of decision, consent agreements and minutes of project delivery team meetings.  It is estimated that an additional 800 hours could be required for the "catch-up" effort and increase the cost to the government by $300,000 - $500,000 depending on an unknown amount of consultation with Shaw.  The review and rebuild effort would require excessive time, possibly one year and the associated costs that the government would not incur with Shaw.   It has therefore been determined that the continued provision of these highly-specialized services are available only from Shaw and award to any other source would result in excessive loss of time to proceed in dispute resolution and in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br><br><br>This is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The General Products Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 06/10/2011 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). 

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete.  This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule.  This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.

NOTE:  THE GREATER SOUTHWEST ACQUISITION CENTER SCHEULE 736 PROGRAM WILL ONLY ACCEPT CONTRACTOR INITIATED MODIFICATION REQUESTS VIA THE GSA EMOD SYSTEM.  THE FOLLOWING LINK WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON UTILIZING THE EMOD SYSTEM, OBTAINING DIGITAL CERTIFICATES, AND USING THE EMOD TRAINING QUIDE: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1 titled, "Instructions to Offerors -Commercial" (JUN 2008), applies to this acquisition and is available at website: http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/12.htm#P257_45709.</p>

<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:<br />To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in this solicitation. 1) The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, "Acceptable", or "Unacceptable". A score of "Acceptable" would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements. An "Unacceptable" score means that the offer will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>PRICE:<br />The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four option periods. Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined. Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer. FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Waters Corporation, 34 Maple Street, Milford, Massachusetts 01757-3696 for the procurement of Waters Service Contract for Waters High Performance Liquid Chromatography Systems (HPLC).</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based upon the results of the market research conducted by the Government which determined that Waters Corporations is the manufacturer of the HPLC systems. The preventative maintenance and repairs can only be performed by the manufacturer. No other vendor can provide the necessary parts, software support, or technical expertise needed for these systems. Parts and accessory items must be compatible with this existing equipment. The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) mission is of the NCGC is such that successful realization of the ambitious and complex goals of this center requires an intermingling of scientific disciplines; namely biology, informatics and chemistry. The long term goals are to develop chemical probes for every protein encoded by the genome, and to identify the complement of chemical space that is needed to cover all of biological space.</p>
<p>Mission one for the chemistry team is the follow-up and optimization chemistry on actives derived within the screening network. In order to successfully accomplish this mission, the chemistry team must be capable of the fast and efficient synthesis and purification of small molecules. Synthetic organic chemistry can be broken down into three main processes. First - the combination of chemical reagents in a fashion that predictive reactions occur and novel chemical matter is created. These reactions are done in step-wise fashion ultimately producing compounds of biochemical interest and use. The second aspect of synthetic chemistry is the purification of the products you want. This is an essential component, as unwanted byproducts poison reactions and complicate biological appreciation. The third aspect is the characterization of these constructs to assure that a scientist has made what he/she predicted would be made. Each of these steps requires its own unique infrastructure, equipment and skills. If any aspect of this progression is defunct, the entirety of the process is compromised. Thus, the use of numerous state of the art instrumentations continues to be a necessity for the NCGC chemistry team to accomplish its mission.<br /><br />Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor must be able to provide the technical expertise, along with software, hardware and accessory parts to keep our three Waters HPLC systems currently in use by our center up and running on a continuous basis. This equipment is essential to our high production chemistry area and any delays in down time would be extremely detrimental to our facility. The Contractor must provide the needed expertise in order to limit the down time and maintain system failure to a minimum. The Analytical Chemistry department depends on this equipment every day for the correct evaluation of these compounds. The Chemistry Department, in conducting research, needs to assess the biological utility of small molecules prepared in the laboratory. This determination relies on the purity and correct identity of the compound of interest. These three HPLC systems requested for this service agreement are crucial in the identification and purification of these compounds. Because these systems are such a key tool in this purification and identification step they are very high use in our laboratory and it is necessary that they are operating correctly with as little down time as possible.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide responsive interaction when a system fails, a timely and accurate plan of action, and the repair including supplying the parts and accessories needed to get the broken units back on line within a timely manner. Waters Corporations is the only source for the technical expertise along with the needed parts and accessories in which service must be maintained in as short a time period as possible. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, <br />with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-54 (November 2, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by December 12, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number, NHGRI-CSB-(HG)-2012-036-RSF may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Rashida Ferebee. Response may be submitted electronically to Rashida.ferebee@nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-11-00170, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ) using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The 100% small business set-aside competition has been dissolved due to no responses to sources sought issued on the August 29, 2011 to determine if there are at least small businesses capable of performing the required services such that the requirement can be set aside for small businesses.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-41.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, which has a size standard of $7.0 million.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price contract for an 18 month period of performance.  This procurement is for additional analysis needed to refine existing spreadsheet models for predicting algal biomass in California streams using data from recent monitoring efforts.  In addition, improved statistical models are needed to link estimates of nitrogen loading to algal biomass and taxonomic composition, and to link shifts in algal composition in turn to shifts in macroinvertebrate community composition.  Finally, information is needed to quantify impacts of atmospheric N loading on stream ecosystem services across the state of California.  Objectives: The contractor shall provide support to develop innovative tools to link nitrogen sources to adverse effects on stream ecosystem  services in California.  Over the past ten years, a comprehensive framework of tools to diagnose eutrophication and address impairments from N and P in freshwater streams and lakes (EPA 2006).  The nutrient numeric endpoint framework (NNE) is centered on two principal tenets:  1) Development of criteria based on the ecological response to increased nutrient availability (e.g. algal biomass, dissolved oxygen, etc.) rather than nutrient concentrations in order to more directly link the criteria to beneficial use and 2) Use of spreadsheet models (e.g. simplified versions of the QUAL2K model) to link response indicator numeric endpoints back to site-specific nutrient concentration targets.  Research shall specifically address the ability of the contractor to link nutrient loading data with algal biomass and with algal and macroinvertebrate taxonomic endpoints.  The contractor shall address how new efforts can build upon research currently being conducted and the availability of  existing data sets and information such as monitoring data from 1) the Southern California Stormwater Monitoring Coalition?s Regional Stream Bioassessment Program, 2) the statewide Perennial Stream Assessment, 3) the Healthy Streams Initiative, and the 4) SCCWRP southern California Stream Algae Index of Biotic Integrity project.

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Regional Mission for Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova, intends to award a contract for implementation of the Business Regulatory, Investment, and Trade Environment (BRITE) Program in Moldova.<br /><br />The purpose of BRITE is to institutionalize a process of continuous improvement in the business enabling environment while achieving specific and measurable reforms in those areas of greatest concern to the business community.  BRITE is divided into three major components: tax administration and trade facilitation, high impact regulatory reforms, and strategic communications. As designed, the interventions build upon the momentum created by BIZTAR in the areas of tax and trade and create a process for the identification and selection of further reforms in a participatory manner with key stakeholders. The principal government counterparts in this endeavor will be the State Tax Service (STS), the Ministry of Finance (which oversees the Customs Service), and the Ministry of Economy.  Additional partners will be key entities from the private sector, civil society, local government, and Parliament.  Success will be measured by specific reforms in tax and trade, a strengthened process for identifying and addressing constraints in the business enabling environment, improved organizational capacity in the related ministries, and steady improvement in the World Bank Doing Business raw scores , over the life of the project.
<p>Task orders will be issued under this IQC to implement three components.  Please see full solicitation for details.</p>

(End of clause) This solicitation is issued as a Request For Quote and as provided in FAR 13.004(a), a quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to the supplier&rsquo;s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer. The Closing Date and Time for receipt of quotes is 15 December 2011 11:00am USA Eastern Time. Quotes shall be emailed to Denise Hall, Contract Specialist at Denise.P.Hall@uscg.mil. Questions regarding this solicitation shall be submitted only in writing to Denise.P.Hall@uscg.mil no later than 14 December 2011, 2:00pm USA Eastern Time. Phone calls regarding the solicitation while the solicitation is open will not be accepted. Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br /><br />Primary Point of Contact.: <br />Cecelia J.

     MCAGCC Access/Security Requirements-Contractor and Contractor-Employee Access Conditions:   

1.  Access Procedures Are Mandatory:  All contractor employees are required to obtain business access or permanent business access.  Daily access procedures must not be used to circumvent background check requirements outlined below.  Attempts to improperly use daily access procedures may result in denial of access to the involved employees. 

2.   Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one day to one year.
  Submit the following:  

	A valid form of Federal or state government I.D.
	If driving a motor vehicle, a valid driver's license, vehicle registration and proof
	of insurance.
	Proof of employment on a valid Government contract (e.g., a letter from the
	prime contractor including contract number and term).
	Proof of an employee background check conducted within the past year
	covering the previous two years.  Contractor employee background checks are
	conducted at contractor expense.  The background check:

(a)	must establish the employee's citizenship or legal alien status.  Acceptable documents include birth certificate, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) forms and passports.
(b)	must include proof of a criminal records check from the county or state where the employee resided for the previous two years (or length of legal residence for foreign nationals in the U.S.
 for less than two years).  
(c)	will be subject to Government verification via the FBI National Crime Information Center (NCIC) Interstate Identification Index (III).  If the background check is selected for  verification, the employee will be required to submit fingerprint records to the FBI Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) database.  NCIC checks and fingerprinting will be performed at
Government expense.

Note: All contractor personnel performing work under this contract requiring access to the military installation shall obtain personal entry and a vehicle pass from the Provost Marshals Office (PMO)  of the Combat Center.  For the MCAGCC/MAGTFTC, this process includes the completion of a COMBAT CENTER ACCESS AUTHORITY letter issued by the Regional Contracting Office (NW).
  

3.  Permanent Business Access:  Required for contractor employees requiring access for periods from one to three years.  Submit all items listed above under business access.  NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.

4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.
  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  

6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.
  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:
	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.
	b.    is illegally present in the United States.
c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.
d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.

Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.

9.
  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.

Please do not process WAWF-RA electronic documents until proof of delivery has been received by your organization.

In some situations the WAWF-RA system will pre-populate the Issue By DoDAAC, Admin By DoDAAC and Pay DoDAAC.
 Contractor shall verify those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF-RA system match the above information. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the contractor shall correct the field(s) and notify the Contracting Officer of the discrepancy (ies). Step by step WAWF-RA invoicing procedures for Combo, 2-in-1, and Cost Voucher are available at the USMC paperless site at http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/pa/ under Vendor Interface section.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. Among these PSCs are experts referred in OTI as the "bullpen," serving on an as-needed, intermittent capacity for OTI in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>This Scope of Work is for those individuals who will be available to work with OTI for short or extended periods of time in the field performing a range of duties outlined in the "Duties and Responsibilities" section. Work assignments will range in length depending on the needs of OTI, and availability of the individuals selected for the position.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Program Advisor will provide ad hoc support and advice on procurement matters to ensure effective implementation of political transition programming overseas. The work will be focused on supporting OTI field-based program implementation by ensuring that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the procurement-related information and training they need to start up, manage and close out field-based activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call program specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p>&bull; Provide recommendation to OTI staff in Washington and field offices in developing new and ongoing OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide assistance on matters pertaining to program-funded U.S. Personal Services Contractors who implement OTI's political transition programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide ad hoc surge support in response to requirements for new OTI country programs or expansion of existing country programs as needed;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, provide surge support for OTI teams in Washington or the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Liaise with the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) and others as necessary (e.g. mission contracting officers, implementing partner procurement officers) to ensure that current procurement policies and procedures are being appropriately applied throughout the start-up, implementation, and close-out phases of OTI country programs.</p>
<p>&bull; When required, travel to country programs to support field operations;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as assigned in support of OTI's program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Program Office Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Operations and Management Division in Washington provides OTI with an advanced level of operational and management support to help ensure ongoing and improved flexible, rapid response in political transition programming overseas. The Operations and Management Division is responsible for instituting and maintaining office-wide systems and processes, office practices and procedures, and the creation of an enhanced response capability through teamwork, responsiveness, fiscal responsibility, quality control, and customer service.</p>
<p>Within the Operations and Management Division, the Procurement and Staffing Team (PS Team) is responsible for analyzing needs, developing solutions, and advising on issues related to contracts, recruitment, and staff management in direct support of OTI's numerous field programs. The PS Team regularly participates in core DCHA/OTI process design, development and training exercises. The goal of the PS Team is to create and maintain an enhanced response capability to support staff management and effective processes for OTI field and Washington teams. The team accomplishes this through working closely with regional teams in order to track staffing needs and support the overall mission of the office as well as address the needs of individual teams.</p>
<p>Program and Operations staff work as a team to ensure country programs are started, managed, and closed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Personnel and Operations Specialist will provide administrative support for program funded U.S. Personal Services Contract (USPSC) employees and program operations in OTI. The Personnel and Operations Specialist works closely with the Procurement and Staffing Team Lead and other members of the Operations and Management Division (OMD) as well as the OTI Country Program teams to ensure program-funded personnel are hired, tracked, and supported.</p>
<p>This is a key position in an exciting and busy office which responds rapidly to crisis situations overseas. For DCHA/OTI to implement its rapid response strategy, it is essential that DCHA/OTI personnel receive prompt support. The Personnel and Operations Specialist has the ability to maintain flexibility in a fast-paced dynamic environment while managing competing priorities and meeting aggressive deadlines. Providing knowledgeable, rapid response using standard operating procedures and making recommendations for improvements or innovations to increase effectiveness and efficiency is critical to successful implementation of OTI's programs and fulfillment of OTI's mandate.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE SOLICITATION FOR TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROFESSIONAL STAFFING SERVICES (TAPS): The General Products Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective 06/10/2011 electronically only. Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Search using Solicitation Number 7FCM-N6-030736-B (include the dashes). NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 4.12 requires prospective contractors to complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov, in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. Prospective contractors are not eligible for an award, if their ORCA information is not current. Additionally, prospective contractors shall update the representations and certifications submitted to the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as necessary, but at least annually, to ensure they are kept current, accurate, and complete. This is a standing solicitation with no closing date for receipt of offers. The main changes to the solicitation are the implementation of the Goldstar Initiative. The Goldstar Initiative created the disclosure of current contract clauses in GSA eLibrary under each individual Schedule solicitation. FSS Contractors that have agreed to standard contract clauses without taking exception will receive a 'Goldstar' next to their name in GSA eLibrary. This solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous, and will contain contracts with periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusive of any options) from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to any option to extend the term of the contract, or cancelled sooner. This solicitation contains an option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years. All contracts will be indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts with a $2,500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period. All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions. Any paper offer received will be rejected as non-responsive. Paper copies of rejected offers will not be returned to the offeror. Schedule 736 is a mandatory eOffer schedule. This is 100% set aside for Small Businesses. We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation. NOTE: THE GREATER SOUTHWEST ACQUISITION CENTER SCHEULE 736 PROGRAM WILL ONLY ACCEPT CONTRACTOR INITIATED MODIFICATION REQUESTS VIA THE GSA EMOD SYSTEM. THE FOLLOWING LINK WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON UTILIZING THE EMOD SYSTEM, OBTAINING DIGITAL CERTIFICATES, AND USING THE EMOD TRAINING QUIDE: http://eoffer.gsa.gov.

<p>7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Worldwide</p>
<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. Among these PSCs are experts referred in OTI as the "bullpen," serving on an as-needed, intermittent capacity for OTI in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>This Scope of Work is for those individuals who will be available to work with OTI for short or extended periods of time in the field performing a range of duties outlined in the "Duties and Responsibilities" section. Work assignments will range in length depending on the needs of OTI, and availability of the individuals selected for the position.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) Program Advisor will provide ad hoc support and advice on procurement matters to ensure effective implementation of political transition programming overseas. The work will be focused on supporting OTI field-based program implementation by ensuring that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the procurement-related information and training they need to start up, manage and close out field-based activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide on-call program specialist capabilities to the OTI Bullpen.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The Program Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based OTI/Program Office Team Leader or his/her designee, the OTI Program Advisor will:</p>

<p>&bull; Provide recommendation to OTI staff in Washington and field offices in developing new and ongoing OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide assistance on matters pertaining to program-funded U.S. Personal Services Contractors who implement OTI's political transition programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide ad hoc surge support in response to requirements for new OTI country programs or expansion of existing country programs as needed;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, provide surge support for OTI teams in Washington or the field;</p>
<p>&bull; Liaise with the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) and others as necessary (e.g. mission contracting officers, implementing partner procurement officers) to ensure that current procurement policies and procedures are being appropriately applied throughout the start-up, implementation, and close-out phases of OTI country programs.</p>
<p>&bull; When required, travel to country programs to support field operations;</p>
<p>&bull; Perform other duties as assigned in support of OTI's program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The OTI Program Advisor will be supervised by the OTI Program Office Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. Work plans, timesheets, travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"><strong>UPDATE (7 Dec 11)<br /></strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre-Proposal Conference Registration<br /></span>The 6 December deadline for registration has passed and registration is closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Directions to the the Hill Conference Center will be posted on tomorrow.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facility Clearance<br /></span>We have received many questions and concerns with the Facility Clearance Requirement and sponsorship for a FCL.&nbsp; The following is&nbsp;in response to all of those inquiries.<br /><br />The C-21 Facility Clearance requirement is solely based upon pre-existing requirements, COMSEC, classified message traffic and storage, Worldwide Global deployment capability, and a current classified deployment (which may or may not be in place at time of award). It is likely that this or another classified deployment will be a requirement of the follow-on contractor. The&nbsp;contractor must have, at day one of contract award, the ability to receive classified deployment information, prepare to negotiate the requirement, and get to the deployed location within the 120 day phase-in timeframe.</span></p>
<p>In regards to Facility Clearances (FCLs), Chapter 2-102 of the NISPOM establishes eligibility requirements a company must meet before it can be processed for an FCL. One requirement is that there has to be a need to access classified information in connection with a legitimate U.S. Government requirement. In the case of the C-21 requirement, access to classified information is not required for a company to SUBMIT A PROPOSAL. The Government is not in a position to remove the requirement to obtain an FCL prior to award because a contractor must have a FCL the day of award in order to carry out the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>Even though there is a requirement to have a FCL prior to award, the Government cannot sponsor any contractors until there is a bona fide need for that contractor to access classified information for this C-21 CLS requirement. Take caution that if another contractor sponsors a company for an FCL for this C-21 effort, there are no guaranteed assurances that DSS will approve the FCL. Defense Security Services (agency responsible to the issuance of FCLs) have informed this agency that the FCL depends on a variety of circumstances such as completion of all FCL required paperwork, the identification of the company Key Management Personnel (KMP) who must obtain personnel clearances to the level of the FCL (if the KMP are uncleared this can take some time), FOCI mitigation, etc.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Additional Questions and Answers<br /></span><span>Additional Questions and Answers are attached to this posting.<br /><br /><strong>UPDATE (1 Dec 11)<br /></strong></span><br />Due to a change in policies and procedures, the lead time to get Base Entry Approval has shortened. For those Contractors who <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not be</strong></span> traveling with someone who already has base access, please get the information requested in the Pre-Proposal Conference Announcement Packet (Guest Name, Drivers License #, State of Issue, and Date of Birth) to Samuel McDuffey, <a href="mailto:Samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil">samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil</a>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NO LATER THAN FRIDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2011</strong></span>.

<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Air Mobility Command is conducting market research to determine qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. Part of the market research is to publish on FedBizOpps a Request for Information (RFI) seeking market information on businesses capable of providing the services, as described in the tasks below. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Firms choosing to respond to this RFI are cautioned that THIS SYNOPSIS/RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. This RFI is a market research tool used to determine the adequacy of eligible business sources prior to determining the acquisition strategy and issuance of a request for proposal. The Government is not obligated to and shall not pay for any information received from any sources responding to this synopsis and will not provide any feedback or carry on discussions with non-federal government activities regarding the information you provided in response to this RFI. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p><strong>2. Background/Scope</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force (AF) Air Mobility Command's (AMC) priority is to develop a comprehensive fitness model with a component designed to increase proactive coping, self-management and leadership skills to enhance individual resilience. Cultivating these skills in our Airmen will ensure that AMC maintain a cadre of balanced, healthy, self-confident Airmen whose physical, mental, spiritual and social fitness and resiliency enable them to effectively manage, and even experience personal and professional growth in response to stressors associated with military service, including a high operational tempo, deployments, recurrent change and the requirement to maintain high personal and professional standards of conduct. Military members face all of these challenges in addition to family, home and community responsibilities and stressors, which may be exacerbated by the rigors of military life. The current effort is intended to support and train individual Airmen in small groups to increase resilience across Air Mobility Command. Goals include:</p>
<p>- Supporting positive coping with challenge and adversity<br />- Reducing negative outcomes <br />- Accomplishing the Air Force global mission</p>
<p>AMC is seeking a program that could train Airmen in skills, attitudes and behaviors to promote individual resilience in conjunction with leadership skills to increase organizational resilience is the objective. Specifically, AMC would like targeted intensive, skills based, small group, experiential resilience training for Airmen, supervisors, middle managers, senior leaders and spouses to be provided by full time professional Resilience Trainers at our 12 AMC installations. The goal is to train 100% of our active duty and DOD civilian employees and a substantial proportion of military spouses. The intervention should be a state of the art, evidence based multimodal educational experience that can be customized to the needs of our target population, manualized for standardized implementation and deployed to Air Force bases within months. Outcomes related to current negative outcomes would be targeted, including: suicide events, alcohol related misconduct, disciplinary actions and family maltreatment. Standardized measures of resilience and related constructs would be employed to assess change in self-reported attitudes, skills and behaviors. Qualitative reports/personal accounts and participant satisfaction surveys would also be employed in assessing the overall value of the program</p>

<DESC>This is a follow-up announcement to previously posted SOURCES SOUGHT N00019-12-R-0001. The Source Sought announcement includes details of the aircraft and general tasking required.&nbsp; The resulting decision based on the review of sources sought responses is that <strong>this effort will be&nbsp;solicited using full and open competitive&nbsp;procedures under NAICS 488190.<br /></strong>
<p><strong>DRAFT PWS:<br /></strong>The Government intends to post a DRAFT version of the Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) and associated DRAFT documents for industry's review and feedback on or about 01 December 2011.</p>
<p>The Government is receptive to ideas to reduce constraining requirements, reduce risks, reduce costs, and highlight potential safety, quality, technical or contractual problem areas. While the DRAFT PWS is not a DRAFT Solicitation, comments and recommendations pertaining to any part of the upcoming solicitation, including Sections L and M, as well as general comments on a best value basis for award are welcomed, including any concerns, questions, refinements, or suggestions. Comments on instructions for preparing and presenting proposal volumes on cost, past performance and other subjects are also welcomed. The Government expects to use a best value basis for award. The Government intends to implement a Performance Measurement Framework (PMF) to measure Contractor performance. The measures align with the Navy's objectives of Safety, Quality, Performance, and Sustainment. A performance incentive is likely to be associated with performance that exceeds contractual minimum requirements, measured by the PMF. Once the PMF is available in DRAFT form, the Government will solicit comments, recommendations, and questions that might further align and clarify the understanding between the Government and potential offerors, including whether the PMF is understandable and executable.<br /><br />The Government invites written industry feedback as noted above in the form of recommendations and/or questions, which shall be received no later than 12:00 p.m. EST on 04 January 2012; however, the Government appreciates earlier written submittals. Contractors are directed NOT to present or provide proprietary information. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Responses and comments will not be published, nor will they be released. The Government is not obligated to, and will not pay for, any information received from potential sources as a result of this posting. <strong>Please submit via e-mail to Jessica McGee at </strong><a href="mailto:jessica.mcgee@navy.mil"><strong>jessica.mcgee@navy.mil</strong></a><strong> on or by 12:00 p.m. EST on 04 January 2012.</strong></p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRY DAY CONFERENCE:<br /></strong>PMA-273 intends to host an Industry Day Conference to openly introduce the T-45 Total Lifecycle Support Product maintenance concept, allow industry parters an opportunity to network with one-another, and receive meaningful feedback regarding the upcoming requirement. The Industry Day event will be held on <strong>14 December 2011 at the Southern Maryland Higher Education Center (SMHEC) located in California, MD from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. EST.</strong> Sign-in will begin at 7:30 a.m. EST. Attendance for the Industry Day is limited to three attendees per company. This is a no fee event and seating is limited. The Government will not reimburse the attendees for any cost associated with participation or attending the Industry Day.</p>
<p><strong>GOVERNMENT-INDUSTRY ONE-ON-ONE's:<br /></strong>In addition to the requested written feedback, following the Industry Day conference, the Government invites interested companies to privately present meaningful feedback in-person. Please be mindful that the one-on-one sessions are not intended for Q&amp;A dialogue between the Government and Industry. They are offered for Industry to share recommendations and/or concerns regarding the upcoming competition as a preface to the written feedback due by 04 January 2011. The Government does not intend to discuss any portion of the acquisition strategy during the one-on-one sessions.</p>
<p><strong>One-on-One sessions will be scheduled between 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 14 December 2011, and 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. EST on 15 December 2011.</strong> The amount of time alloted to each company will be approximately one hour, but ultimately dependant on the number of companies scheduled. The scheduled time frames will be equal for each company and provided at time of scheduling confirmation. There is no fee to arrange a one-on-one session and seating is also limited to three attendees per company. Contractors are directed NOT to present or provide proprietary information during the one-on-one sessions. Information and materials submitted to the Government WILL NOT be returned.

<DESC>Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System

Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the design, engineering development, fabrication and test of an Engineering Development Model (EDM) for the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) Compatible AN/SLQ-25X Torpedo Countermeasure System with optional Low Rate Initial Production System production, testing and delivery and the associated program management, systems engineering, and logistic support planning requirements.  The objective of the AN/SLQ-25X program is to deploy an improved system that will provide the NIXIE acoustic and non-acoustic countermeasure capability previously fielded under AN/SLQ-25A/C with power, data and line handling interfaces to the TWS and improved Performance Monitoring/Fault Localization (PM/FL) capabilities.
  The AN/SLQ-25X will replace the AN/SLQ-25A/C System(s) on High Value Units (HVU). The AN/SLQ-25X is a digitally controlled, modular design, electro-acoustic soft-kill countermeasure decoy system.  It employs an underwater towed body acoustic projector, which is towed astern of the host ship by a fiber optic tow cable.  The system defends ships against wake homing and acoustic homing torpedoes.
The Navy plans to issue a draft of the AN/SLQ-25X Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and the Statement of Work (SOW) in the near future and provide a limited time for questions and comments.  Following the issuance of the draft PIPFS and SOW and the question, comment and answer period, the Navy plans to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about 04 March 2011 for industry participation.
  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Companies may download the RFP on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: http://www.neco.navy.mil.  The solicitation and any amendments thereto will be issued electronically; subsequently the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders mailing list.  
The Prime Item Product Functions Specification (PIPFS) and other related files will be mailed only to those companies with a validated security clearance.  Prospective offerors must submit a written request for those documents to the PCO Representative, Sharon B. Allen, at Sharon.Allen@navy.mil.
  The written request must include the company name, cage code, and the complete destination address and security point of contact (POC).  Once a prospective offerors need-to-know and security clearance is verified and approved, the company will be authorized to receive the PIPFS and other related files.  The PIPFS and other related files will be mailed to the approved requestors on the same day the RFP is issued.  The RFP and the attachments listed in solicitation number N00024-10-R-6280 will be issued electronically.  Upon approval the classified PIPFS and all unclassified related files will be mailed.  
The Government will consider all written comments and or questions.  The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comments or questions.
  All such questions should be received within ten (10) working days after release of the RFP to allow the Navy adequate time to prepare and issue responses prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals.  Any subsequent revision to any specification or solicitation requirement based on comments and or questions received remains solely at the Governments discretion.  No comments, questions, or inquiries shall be made to any Government person other than the point of contact identified in this synopsis.  
This is not an RFP.  This notice shall not be construed as a promise to contract or commitment of any kind.  This information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract.
The point of contact is Sharon B.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />For the<br />Department of Homeland Security (DHS)<br />National Protectorate and Programs Division (NPPD) National Cyber Security Program<br />Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III Project.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) as identified in FAR 15.201 (c)(7). This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time, and this notice shall be not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cyber Security Division is requesting industry feedback on existing Government product performance requirements involving the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Tier III project. The objective of SAIR Tier III is to provide U.S. Government (USG) agencies the ability to assess, assure, monitor, and measure the security posture of their information technology (IT) assets in a timely manner (i.e., near-real time.) This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas and initiatives related to this request. Additionally, respondents will have the opportunity to comment on the draft product performance requirements for SAIR III listed on Attachment 2.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate industry feedback on Government SAIR III technical requirements then the Government may hold an industry day to answer any specific questions related to this RFI. The Government may use feedback that results from this RFI and industry day to further refine technical requirements to potentially establish qualified product list (QPL) for COTS products that can be utilized by federal, state, and local Governments for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>If the development of a QPL results from this RFI, DHS NCSD will be responsible for managing the QPL in terms of testing and evaluating COTS products to ensure proposed products meet any developed SAIR III minimum technical requirements. This QPL will be developed for multiple federal agency use. Product acquisitions will be at the discretion of each individual agency. The potential QPL may be established as guidance to assist federal agencies in managing information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Information Systems Security Line of Business (ISSLOB) was created in 2005 to improve the level of information systems security across government by eliminating duplication of effort, increasing aggregate expertise and enhancing the overall security posture of the Federal Government. This value proposition is supported through the use of Shared Service Centers (SSC's), consolidated acquisitions, agency standard practices and lessons learned across agencies.<br />In 2007, the ISSLOB launched a series of procurements under the Situational Awareness Incident Response (SAIR) Initiative. Based on guidance from the Federal Systems Security Governance Board (FSSGB), the oversight body of the ISSLOB, the SAIR procurements follow a tiered execution approach. The SAIR initiatives are aimed at providing an efficient, cost effective mechanism to deliver enhanced information system security capabilities across the federal civilian enterprise. <br />The cyber landscape in which federal agencies operate is a constantly changing and dynamic environment. Threats to the nation's information security continue to evolve and government leaders have recognized the need for a modified approach in protecting our cyber infrastructure. The new approach moves away from historical compliance reporting toward combating threats to our nation's networks on a real time basis. The tools and services delivered through the SAIR Tier III project will provide federal agencies with the ability to enhance/automate their existing continuous network monitoring capabilities, correlate and analyze critical security-related information, and enhance risk-based decision making at the agency and federal enterprise level. Information obtained from the automated monitoring tools will eventually feed CyberScope and allow for the correlation and analysis of security-related information across the federal enterprise.</p>
<p>2. SAIR III TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The capabilities sought for SAIR Tier III are:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to document, track, and discover both authorized and unauthorized IT assets. Such as NIST-SCAP validated asset management tools. <br />2. Configuration Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to assess, monitor, and report compliance of agency-specified security configuration settings and patches, as well as real-time altering of changes to approved baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access and security controls. Such as NIST SCAP-validated FDCC scanners and authenticated configuration scanners. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software security weaknesses; and report the associated potential exposure risks using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and the Common Weakness Scoring System (CWSS<sup>TM</sup>). , For example: NIST SCAP-validated authenticated vulnerability &amp; patch scanners, unauthenticated vulnerability scanners, source code security analyzers, web and database vulnerability scanners.<br />4. Malware Detection Tools. Products that provide the ability to discover, isolate, characterize, and report known malware for supporting agency's security incident response process. Such as Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (MAEC<sup>TM</sup>) -compatible malware tools. <br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Reporting Tools. Products that provide the ability to collect, associate, compile, and report security posture metrics in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness. For example: The governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) reporting tools and FISMA security authorization management tools.</p>
<p>Where the capabilities are defined:</p>
<p>1. Asset Management Function: System functions that support the management of hardware and software inventory baseline by documenting, tracking, and discovery of agency-responsible IT assets (i.e., hardware, software, and virtualized configuration items); and to identify unauthorized IT assets.<br />2. Configuration Management Function: System functions that support the management of security configuration baseline by documenting and tracking compliance with agency-specified security configuration settings and software patches (i.e., compliance with Federal Desktop Core Configuration [FDCC], USG Configuration Baseline [USGCB], and Security Technical Implementation Guides [STIGs], etc.) This includes system functions that provide continuous real-time detection and alerting of unauthorized changes to baseline configurations for hardware, software, user access, and security controls for perimeter defense and the core IT operating environment. <br />3. Vulnerability Management Function: System functions that discover, identify, and locate known security vulnerabilities and software weaknesses (i.e., the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures [CVE&reg;] and the Common Weakness Enumeration [CWE<sup>TM</sup>]); , and support the understanding of their associated potential exposure risks (i.e., metrics generated from the Common Vulnerability Scoring System [CVSS] and the Common Weakness Scoring System [CWSS<sup>TM</sup>].) <br />4. Malware Detection Function: System functions that discover, identify, characterize, and locate known malware in a standard language (i.e., the Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization [MAEC<sup>TM</sup>]) for supporting agency's incident response process.<br />5. Situational Awareness Analysis and Report Function: System functions that collect, associate, compile, and report metrics that support analysis in the understanding of security posture in terms of IT security governance and operational effectiveness."</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) addresses the ISSLOB's information systems security need for tools to support a continuous monitoring capability. <br />The draft performance requirements these tools must possess can be found in the attached document, SAIR III Product Performance Requirements for Information Security Continuous Monitoring.</p>
<p>3. RFI PURPOSE AND LIMITATIONS:</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post the question submitted by an interested vendor as well as the Government's response.

Questions and Answers - Round 1
12/7/2011
1.	Of the items being shipped, are any of them classified as hazardous materials?  If so, is the customer looking to also incorporate the capability of creating electronically validated shipping documents based on mode of transport for the Hazardous Materials to ensure regulatory compliance?    These shipping documents would include Bill of Ladings, International Maritime Declarations of Dangerous Goods, Shippers Declarations of dangerous goods, FedEx and UPS specific Documents, MSDS, Emergency Response forms, Federal and International Permits and Letters, etc.
        A:  Yes, hazardous materials are transported but at a very low frequency and very limited 	  	variety.  No hazardous materials functionality enhancements are envisioned at this time.  	Additional capabilities for accommodating hazardous materials are not required.

The original contract award consisted of a basic six month period and 4 annual options. This action is to exercise the first of those options.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN<br />COMPETITION (OVERSEAS CONTRACTING ACTIVITIES)
<p>I recommend that the U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the Health Insurance Services for the Locally Engaged Staff (LES). The estimated cost is $340,500.</p>
<p>This is a follow-on contract. This LES Health Insurance contract is a bridge extension starting five years and six months after the effective date of the current contract and continuing for a period of twelve months from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.</p>
<p>The American Embassy in Ouagadougou requires Health Insurance coverage for the LES employees in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The US Embassy Ouagadougou has determined that the prevailing practice by employers in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso is to provide for their employees health insurance protection and that the cost of such insurance protection is usually borne in full or in part by the employer. It has been determined that such health insurance protection is representative of local prevailing compensation practice; therefore it desires to adopt such locally prevailing practice as part of its compensation plan for LES.</p>
<p>The contractor is the sole responsible vendor based on previous acceptable work. Post is taking all necessary steps to have a new contract signed by December 1, 2012. Post could not compete this "bridge" procurement due to the fact that the benefit levels are being re-evaluated for compliance with local practice and did an other than full and open competition authorized under 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1).</p>
<p>There is only one responsible source for this current period. The current holder of the LES Heath Insurance Contract that expires November 30, 2011, is the sole vendor on the local market who can effectively continue the LES health insurance services while the new solicitation is completed. They are proven to be technically qualified to continue this service. It will be risky to award this contract to another vendor for this short period.</p>
<p>The bridge contract will serve only for the period until the award of the new contract so it is not being competed. As the total estimate of this bridge contract is $340,500. As the total estimate of this bridge contract is $340,500 with a bi-weekly price of $37.78 (480 CFA/$1) per family premium and a bi-weekly price of $17.32 (480 CFA/$1) per single premium.</p>
<p>Based on current market conditions and inflation, the anticipated cost for the U.S. Government is fair and reasonable. The price (premium rates) has been strictly negotiated in such a way that it remains the same. The premium rates in the contract extension are the same as the current rates. These rates have been in effect for five (5) years and six (6) months. It is not been affected by inflations.</p>
<p>In preparation for the new contract award, a market survey is ongoing. The results of the market survey are not yet available. This bridge contract will just serve to cover the time period between termination of the current contract and award of a new contract.</p>

<DESC><p>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />IAW FAR 8.405-6<br />MILITARY PERSONNEL (MILPERS) SUPPORT SERVICE</p>
<p><br />I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY AND REQUIRING AGENCY:</p>
<p>Requiring Agency: Secretary of the Air Force, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget (SAF/FMB), 1030 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20030<br />Contracting Activity: Air Force District of Washington, Contracting Directorate (AFDW/PK), 2822 Doherty Dr SW, Suite 310, Building 94, PSC 341, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, DC 20373.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED:</p>
<p>AFDW/PKE intends to award a single new firm-fixed task order for Military Personnel (MILPERS) support service for SAF/FMB. Purchase Request F1AF2B1266A001 will be a Firm Fixed Price Advisory and Assistance Services contract to bring closure to a previous effort in preparation of transition of effort to Government personnel.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE<br />AGENCY'S NEEDS:</p>
<p>The MILPERS requirement is an Advisory and Assistance Service which provides cost projections for the justification book (J-Book) output system, financial modeling and forecasting, analysis, a stand-alone data repository, and training of Government personnel for a clean turnover of requirement support. Additionally, the requirement provides commensurate training of Government personnel (military, civilian and contractor) to effectively use the system and to provide documentation of tasks to be completed for a seamless turnover of all services to the Government. The estimated cost of the contract is $729,440 with a period of performance from 1 December 2011 to 30 November 2012.</p>
<p>IV. AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE:</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c), as implemented by FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B). Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Over the course of the one year period of the proposed order, the Government intends to develop organic capabilities to accomplish the tasks previously contracted. SAF/FMB has established the goal to complete the transition within this period by receiving guidance and training from the incumbent to ensure mission success. A lapse in the current support at this time from the incumbent, Neubrain LLC., will inhibit progress toward defining the MILPERS budget formulation requirements essential for this operation.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE:</p>
<p>The agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique services available from only the above cited source that possesses unique capabilities as follows:</p>
<p>The required services can only be provided by one responsible source in order to transition the requirement from the contractor to the Government. If the contract is competed it will result in substantial duplication of costs and efforts for a 12 month requirement that would not be recovered through competition. Additionally, unacceptable delays would occur during the initial transition to a new service provider. The Government estimates that it would be in excess of three months for a new vendor to overcome the learning curve and accomplish development of new processes, and training of new personnel. Awarding and training another contractor only for the contractor to educate the Government on newly developed processes is not in the best interest of the Government. This would result in delaying the transition to the Government by adding additional time beyond the one year to affect this change. Further, potential costs would be incurred after award to a new contractor because an increased in the period of performance would be needed to ensure the Governments minimum needs are met. Costs could double as it could take up to two years or more to develop new processes and turn them over to the Government.</p>
<p>There are major development efforts underway to further optimize analytical models in the areas of Ongoing Contingency Operation (OCO) J-Book, Permanent Change of Station (PCS) Data analytics, refinement of the Execution Data Feed (Exfeed), and other components. These are highly specialized activities that require extensive knowledge of MILPERS Budgeting, analytical modeling, and multidimensional analysis. The incumbent, Neubrain LLC., is developing these models to mirror existing processes which they are preparing to turn over to the Government.</p>
<p>Additionally, IAW FAR 8.404(d), GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in 8.405, the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:</p>
<p>The market possesses sufficient commercial characteristics of similar work performed in the public and private sector, however, the end product of the service, J-Book support, is unique to the Air Force MILPERS pay budgeting domain. The knowledge and understanding of the Air Force MILPERS analytical processes, source data feeds, business processes, and financial modeling requirements is a critical aspect of the ability to provide the required J-Book support. The incumbent contractor, Neubrain, LLC., has developed these processes and will educate and turn over the processes to the Air Force; no competing contractor has the experience on working with the systems to provide adequate training to Government personnel to meet the transition target.</p>
<p>VII. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND<br />OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p>Upon award of the current contract, Neubrain, LLC, developed a process based on the SAF/FMB requirements. The process was designed specifically for Air Force MILPERS budgeting and has been successfully supporting the Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve MILPERS Budgeting area for the past six years. Neubrain, LLC. has been supporting this contract directly for four years and over time, the contractor has developed systems and processes supporting of the financial data feeds, modeling, forecasting, budgeting, and reporting in the Air Force MILPERS budgeting domain. This history and development has resulted in processes and highly specialized experience and support making the incumbent unequivocally qualified to satisfy the requirement. The previous contract did not require follow on support therefore none was forecasted. The Government anticipated performing this requirement without contractor support upon expiration of the previous contract. However, the Government was not able to assume the work in a timely manner and required an additional twelve months of contract support. A planning package for this requirement was not received until 12 September 2011, which was insufficient to allow for proper procurement planning for a short term contract. This new contract will provide the Government the ability to perform the requirement with no follow on support required.</p>
<p>VIII. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO<br />REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING<br />SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>It is imperative the Air Force maintain continuity with Neubrain for the one year period while the MILPERS budgeting process can be mapped and documented by the Government. Once mapping and documentation is complete, a refined process will be defined allowing the Air Force to pursue internal solutions; mitigating the need to use contract support. The intent of the Government is to transition to an organic capability.</p>
