<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format found in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is F11PS00381 and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-48) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  
This is a small-business set-aside procurement under NAISC classification code: 541712, and PSC: V124.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.
Proposal Pricing:Offerors responding to this requirement must submit the following pricing information along with proposal:a.	The unit daily price for vessel, fuel, equipment, and crew for a maximum of 90 days.b.	Mobilization to the project locationc.	The daily cost of mooring the vessel on Lake Tahoe during the project. (The type and place of mooring the vessel in Lake Tahoe is at the vendor's discretion.)d.	Demobilization 
STATEMENT OF WORK GENERAL: The Government requires services for a contractor to furnish vessels, nets, labor, materials and equipment, unless specifically identified otherwise, to provide hydroacoustic mapping, deepwater netting and trawling and other aquatic species sampling services in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and California.  
The objective is to develop and implement sampling methods that will allow us to gather rigorous baseline data on the existing aquatic assemblages in Lake Tahoe, both native and nonnative, habitat utilization and seasonal to daily distribution patterns.  The sampling methodologies will lead to a research and monitoring protocol that will inform managers about changes in distribution, densities, habitat utilization and seasonal variation in aquatic populations in response to reintroduction of LCT and suppression of exotic species.  The target aquatic species include mysis shrimp, rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, Asian clams, crayfish, kokanee salmon, zooplankton, suckers, tui chubs and eventually Lahontan cutthroat trout. This study and management program is in its infancy and will require an adaptive approach as conditions and effectiveness of methods are evaluated.
SCOPE: 1.  The deliverables from the vendor include:a.	Hydroacoustic data and video of aquatic species throughout Lake Tahoe, Nevada and California;b.	Sampling reports (catch and recording details) of the aquatic species to determine species distribution (locations) and abundance (how many) within Lake Tahoe as well as seasonal (during spawning) and potentially diurnal distributions and abundance.  c.	The reports should include listings of the type of aquatic species, number, length, weight, and location in the lake developed in collaboration with FWS personnel and postdoctoral student.d.	Habitat use of all aquatic species will be documented (where they feed, shelter/hide, spawn, migrate within the lake (travel patterns), etc.);e.	Mysis shrimp distribution is a priority target species in the development of a sampling methodology.  f.	The methodology will include using hydroacoustic data, video, net sampling, fish trawls, crustacean traps, clam dredges (or other methods that have been successful for the vendor in the past).g.	The USFWS requires that one of our biologists or researchers be on board the vessel each sampling event.h.	A "working day" consists of 6-8 hours on the boat in the lake on any given calendar day.i.	It is expected that there will be days that work will not be  performed due to weather or other circumstances.  Therefore, the vendor will invoice the USFWS based on a daily rate for the vessel and crew, a monthly rate for the mooring, and reimbursable terms for miscellaneous expenses and mobilization.
2.  Vendors will submit quotes listing:e.	The "working day" daily cost for the vessel and crew for 90 working days.f.	Mobilization to get the vessel to Lake Tahoe. g.	The daily cost of mooring the vessel on Lake Tahoe during the delivery period.   The type and place of mooring the vessel in Lake Tahoe is at the vendor's discretion.h.	Miscellaneous expenses for permits/fees, sampling equipment and materials, etc.  It is up to the vendor to determine what sampling equipment and materials they will use.i.	 Demobilization costs for contract termination
3.  Other qualifications:a.	The vendor will supply the hydroacoustic equipment and equipment for monitoring/sampling Mysis and other aquatic species in deep alpine lakes.  The sampling devices (i.e. nets) should allow the maximum targeted capture of mysis while allowing non-targeted species to escape unharmed.b.	Live capture of targeted species for tagging and sampling efforts.c.	Nets/specialized equipment used for deepwater netting and trawling will need to be able to capture all species alive and allow capture of targeted species and release of non-targeted species through the use of exclusion devices built within the nets. d.	The vessel will need to have equipment aboard that allows for the handling, sorting and measuring of species after their capture in the nets (i.e. live wells/tanks)e.	The vendor must have a minimum of 10 years mysis sampling experience.f.	The boat captain must have a minimum of 10 years experience in commercial operation of vessels in deep alpine lakes with no safety citations.g.	The research vessel should be equipped with communication devices and safety equipment that comply with all safety rules and regulation, as stipulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, governing boats in Lake Tahoe.
PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The hydroacoustic and sampling operations will take place in Lake Tahoe, Nevada and California.  The USFWS and the vendor will meet prior to sampling to map where the sampling will begin and end.  The contract should be for a period of one year from the notice to proceed from the contracting officer.  The vendor will submit a report every 10 working days that lists that work that was performed and a summary of the data obtained.
INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:  1.	At the end of every 10 monitoring/sampling days, the USFWS will meet with the vendor to evaluate the data and together with the vendor will determine whether to continue, postpone, change, or terminate the sampling.  2.	The evaluation will include determining whether or not the methodologies being used are effective (i.e. are the targeted species being located and caught).  3.	Evaluation of effectiveness will be based upon identification of different species locations throughout the lake and the numbers caught.  For example, if mysids are being targeted and the contractor is able to locate 16 different sites within the lake with mysids and proceeds to catch this species at 4 of the 16 locations within that 10 day window, it would be deemed effective. A success rate of approximately 25% would be considered beneficial. Conversely, if the contractor is unable to determine locations of mysids in the lake, the outcome would be to postpone until later in the season or discontinue this type of sampling. 4.	If the targeted nonnative species are not available or located during a trial period each month, the sampling might be postponed until the following month.  5.	In the case of a low catch rate/ location rate for each of the targeted species (less than 25%); there will be an evaluation by the USFWS and the vendor to determine whether it is the environment (size and depth of Lake Tahoe or low densities) or the methodology of the vendor that is causing the low success rate.
GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS/INFORMATION:  Not Applicable.
AVAILABILITY:  It is the vendor's responsibility to know and comply with all standard rules and regulation, as stipulated by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, governing boats in Lake Tahoe.

<CONTACT>Shelley Smith, Contracting Specialist, Phone 816-426-2066, Fax 816-274-6993, Email shelley.smith@noaa.gov
<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation for services to identify Benthic Macroinvertebrates from Lake Ontario and Musekgon Lake for the Great Lakes Environmental Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, MI.
<p><br />Benthic macroinvertebrate populations have long been used to monitor the relative health of Great Lakes ecosystems. Community changes integrate and reflect relative impacts of various perturbations, including nutrient enrichment and invasive species. Currently, populations in Lake Ontario are undergoing extensive changes that are unprecedented in both spatial extent and temporal scale.</p>
<p>Scope: GLERL will provide the contractor a total of 410 specimens of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae. The specimens of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae will be mounted on glass slides. The contractor will identify the organisms to the genus or species level.</p>
<p>Objectives: The goal of the contract is to get organism with the two groups Oligochaeta and Chironomidae identified to the species level. GLERL will then count and tabulate the species in each sample and analyze changes in species composition over time and space.</p>
<p>Tasks: GLERL will provide the contractor with organisms after they have been placed in glyerine and mounted on slides under coverslips. Prior to this, organism lengths have been traced on sheets under low magnification using a camera lucida mounted on a microscope. The contractor will identify each organism to species (or genus) under high magnification and place an identification code next to each tracing on the sheet. All transfers of mounted organisms and sheets with the traced lengths will be accomplished hand-to-hand. The government will pre-arrange a method of transporting the material. Extreme care in organism transfer and exchange is important since once the organisms are mounted and traced, the slides must not be jostled or the organisms will move and their position on the slide will no longer correspond to their tracing on the sheets.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 18 months from date of award.</p>
<p>Required Technical Expertise:<br />&bull; A minimum of 10 years of experience in identifying species of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae collected from Great Lakes sediments<br />&bull; A minimum of 10 years of experience in the preparation of benthic invertebrates for the identification of Oligochaeta and Chironomidae gained from a combination of graduate school or experience <br />&bull; Demonstrated ability to operate and calibrate microscopes and to use taxonomic texts Demonstrated ability to identify Oligochaeta and Chironomidae organisms to the genus or species level</p>
<p>This is a small business set aside. The NAICS code for this action is 541620. The government intends to procure services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. A copy of the Request for Quote will be issued on or about February 25, 2011 and will be uploaded to this announcement. An e-mail may be sent to shelley.smith@noaa.gov after this issue date to request a copy of the Request For Quote by e-mail.</p>
<p>The government requires all contractors doing business with the government to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number, which may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or by phone at 1-866-705-5711. The government encourages all contractors to submit their Representations and Certifications on-line Business Partner Network (BPN) at https://orca.bpn.gov. The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in CCR.</p>

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services and related products to continue the development of a systematic process for the estimation of shrimp fishing effort in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA intends to establish a system of automated processes to improve the estimation of total shrimp fishing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. This is the fourth part of an ongoing project to develop and establish a permanent shrimp fishing effort data acquisition program to be managed by NOAA Fisheries Service in cooperation with the commercial shrimp industry. The electronic logbook (ELB) methodology and technology was originally developed as prototypes by LGL Ecological Research Associates, Inc., (LGL), of Bryan, Texas, while a subcontractor to the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Foundation, Inc., (Foundation), under a series of financial assistance awards from NOAA Fisheries Service. The first contract included development, production, and placement of the first 50 ELB units and associated memory modules; development of presentation materials, and preparation for and facilitation of port meetings with interested parties. The second contract covered the purchasing of 200 ELB unit materials and associated memory modules; production of the remaining 100 ELB units and associated memory modules; assembly and placement of 100 of those units on vessels identified through scientific random selection processes; purchasing in the last four months of Phase II the raw materials of the last 100 ELB units to be assembled and placed on vessels in the first year of Phase III; collection of data from the first 50 ELB units and from the next 100 ELB units after they are placed; comparison of the ELB data with port agent records for the corresponding vessels, periods, and locations; facilitation of additional port meetings; development and refinement of the data base and algorithms for data comparisons; and reporting and recommendations to the Government, the shrimping community, and other interested parties on the findings of the data collection and analysis processes. Phase III covered the assembly and placement of 100 ELB units on vessels, production of 200 additional ELB units and associated memory modules bringing the total of units to 450. Also, Phase III covered the performance of analyses and reports on a quarterly and annual basis through the period of performance. The contractor will provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, supplies, and other direct items of expense necessary to perform the required services. The period of performance will begin October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012, with 4, 12-month option years. Services include, but are not limited to: the purchase and assembly of parts and components to replace any ELB units on vessels identified through the established scientific random selection process for selecting vessels. This process will be provided to the contractor at the time of a contract award; using the replacement ELB units (furnished government equipment) to serve as a pool of replacement units to assure that once the original placements have been made, there will be no less than 400 placed and continuously operating ELB units at all times in offshore waters during the course of the contract period; purchasing and assembling the parts and components to add 100 units in inshore vessels in Louisiana; downloading and analyzing shrimp fishing effort data from all existing ELB units in operation throughout the course of the contract period; refining and improving the existing analytical software and algorithms to enhance effort estimates in order to provide a self contained fully functional operating system at the end of the contract period; providing quarterly progress reports and a final year end summary report of progress; developing operational manuals for estimating shrimp fishing effort from the combined resources of the ELB records and the landings data. A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about March 18, 2011. All small businesses interested in receiving a copy of the RFP must submit a request in writing to Jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest (NAVFAC SW) is extending the current Northern California and Nevada 8(a) Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA).  NAVFAC SW is seeking Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) "Developmental Stage" (first four years of the 8(a) program) construction firms with a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV) to participate in this BOA program.  CURRENT BOA HOLDERS DO NOT NEED TO REAPPLY FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  The Navy is targeting the issuance of an indeterminate number of BOAs.  The estimated period of performance for the BOA will be one year with the government reserving the right to exercise options up to three additional years, with no single option exceeding one year, in accordance with DFARS 216.703(c).
  The purpose of the BOA is to enhance contracting opportunities to qualified 8(a) Developmental Stage construction firms that are located in one of the four specified SBA Districts. The BOA is not a contract, but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA provides a framework of contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, and conditions which will apply, to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each order, to any firm order for services issued pursuant to the agreement. Each order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
 Under the BOA, firms with an applicable NAICS code compete on task orders for requirements within the designated SBA District where the work is to be performed. If adequate competition cannot be obtained within the designated SBA District, the Government, upon SBA concurrence, reserves the right to open the area of competition to include BOA holders in adjacent districts. The anticipated types of construction may include emergency repairs (broken and leaking water lines, roof leaks, HVAC, and other mechanical projects), minor construction projects (exterior and interior renovations, demolition, painting, and installing pipelines), and design assistance (on-site design solution for emergency calls and design/build services for minor construction items).
 Only NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and 238 pertain to this BOA. Each firm will identify their primary NAICS code and a secondary NAICS code (if applicable). There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement; however, there is a maximum dollar amount of $3,500,000 per firm, per year. Any unused capacity in one year will not be carried over to the subsequent years. Individual task orders will range between $2,001 and $1,000,000. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond or Surety Letter (as applicable) with each proposal over $30,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each order. Annually the Navy and the SBA will review the continued need for this agreement in light of a) usefulness and need for service and b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.
 The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year for each region. Task orders will not be advertised. Options will not be exercised for firms that do not continue to meet all BOA requirements and will be removed accordingly. No new orders will be issued to the Contractor and this agreement will terminate. Termination of the BOA under these circumstances shall have no effect on any orders previously issued. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification.
 This agreement may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the Navy may continue to place orders under the BOA. Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will receive a BOA. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and the firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible. To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm must meet all the following criteria: (1) Be a certified 8(a) Developmental Stage participant prior to the submission date of April 14, 2011 and still be certified as an 8(a) Developmental Stage participant at the time of award; have a bona fide place of business in one of four SBA Districts (Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, CA; and Las Vegas, NV); (2) Be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, including the new SBA Dynamic Small Business Listing; Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/; and VETS-100 at http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm (if not applicable, provide a statement that the firm has not had contracts subject to this requirement); (3) Be licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work within a range of $2,001 - $1,000,000; and (4) Demonstrate technical experience/past performance (including safety) of similar size, general scope, and complexity of construction project(s) under NAICS Subsectors 236, 237, and/or 238 within the last three years.
  Joint Venture/Mentor Protg firms are not allowed.  TO BE CONSIDERED, INTERESTED FIRMS MUST DOWNLOAD AND USE THE CHECKLIST FROM THIS WEBSITE TO ENSURE ALL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. After carefully reviewing the submittal requirements checklist to ensure compliance, please submit your package via email to laurel.colon@navy.mil or to NAVFAC Southwest, Attn: Laurel Colon, Code RAQ20, 1220 Pacific Highway, San Diego, CA 92132, not later than 2:00 PM Pacific time on April 14, 2011. EARLY SUBMISSIONS ARE ENCOURAGED. Late submissions, submissions received after 2:00 PM Pacific time on April 14, 2011, will not be considered.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to award a sole-source contract to Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation for execution planning and accomplishment of CNO scheduled dry-docking availabilities for specific DDG and FFG Class ships homeported in and visiting the Puget Sound, Washington area. The requirements include execution planning; accomplishment of CNO scheduled availabilities; and emergent maintenance efforts. A cost type contract is contemplated. 

The contract will be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (7), the statutory exception justifying the use of other than full and open competition in cases where it is determined to be in the public interest to award the contract to a particular source.
 Todd Pacific Shipyards is the only private contractor in the Puget Sound area that has facilities to dry-dock DDG and FFG class ships. A contract award to a contractor other than Todd would adversely impact PERSTEMPO/OPTEMO and cause extraordinary personnel disruption and family impacts that may ultimately affect military retention.

This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

It is anticipated that the solicitation for this procurement will be posted to FebBizOpps during the week of February 14, 2011. Please visit www.fbo and search for the solicitation under NAICS Code: 531 -- Real Estate/531320 -- Offices of Real Estate Appraisers.<br /><br />Because the appraisal requirements are not yet identified, GSA looks to establish multiple-award indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the following areas. (Contractors may submit proposals for multiple geographical areas, if qualified.) <br /><br />Area 1 Chicago (area bounded by the city limits of Chicago, Illinois)<br />Area 2 State of Illinois (remainder of Illinois not located within Area 1) <br />Area 3 State of Indiana <br />Area 4 State of Michigan <br />Area 5 State of Minnesota <br />Area 6 State of Ohio <br /><br />Contractors will need to be proficient in valuing the following property types: <br />&bull; General Purpose &ndash; Office, Warehouse <br />&bull; Vacant Land &ndash; Rural or Urban <br />&bull; Special Purpose &ndash; U.S. Courthouse, U.S. Post Office, Historic Properties,&nbsp; Border Stations/Land Ports of Entry <br />&bull; Mixed Use &ndash; Office / U.S. Courthouse / Retail <br />&bull; Facilities &ndash; Multiple-building complexes that may be unique or complex in nature. <br /><br />These contracts are being established to provide flexibility and convenience for GSA in the procurement of appraisal services, but GSA is not <em>required</em> to utilize these contracts for any or all appraisal service needs. Since multiple awards are anticipated for each geographical area, awardees are advised that fair opportunity will be given for all orders over $3,000.00, except for specific situations outlined in the RFP. These contracts are open to small and large business concerns. <br /><br />Each contract established will have a one-year base term with four (4), one-year renewal options. As requirements are identified, individual task orders will be competed among the multiple awardees for the associated area and award of the task order will be based on best value to the Government considering price and other price-related factors. GSA&rsquo;s appraisal activities are managed by the Portfolio Management Division (PMD) located in GSA&rsquo;s Regional Office in Chicago, but appraisal deliverables will be reviewed by both the Regional Portfolio Management Division and by GSA Central Office in Washington, DC. <br /><br />Potential offerors are advised to register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at this time if they have not already done so. Those that are already registered are encouraged to verify their accounts are active and up-to-date. <br /><br />CCR is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity. Effective October 1, 2003, all Government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award. CCR can be accessed at the following URL: www.ccr.gov. <br /><br />Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of ORCA in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ALL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS MUST BE REGISTERED IN ORCA. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<DESC>1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  a. General: This requirement is being advertised for up to two awards as an UNRESTRICTED Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), for various Architect Engineer (AE) services, construction phase services (CPS) as it relates to the design, professional services, and design services required under this indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity contract. These awards are to support various Military Design and Construction Projects which are generally within, but not limited to the Southwest Region. It will allow the flexibility to share capacity with other Corps Districts, outside SWD boundaries, and other Federal agencies in unique cases, but primarily for the Fort Worth District, at Fort Bliss, TX, and White Sands Missile Range, NM, in accordance with PL 582, Brooks AE Act, and implemented in FAR Part 36.6.  The Southwest Region refers to the geographic area encompassing the States of AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK, and TX.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  North American Industrial Classification System Code applicable to this project is 541330, Engineering Services, which has a size standard of $4,500,000, $4.5M, in average annual receipts and corresponds to SIC Code 8711.<BR><BR>This announcement is OPEN TO ALL BUSINESSES regardless of size.  The initial contract is anticipated to be awarded on or about April 2011.  Two  IDIQ contract(s) may be awarded from this single announcement for an estimated value of $47.5M each with a minimum guarantee amount of $10,000 each for each contracts, for a three year base period and two one-year option periods for a total term of five years. The Government anticipates awarding task orders between $3K to $2,000,000. Some task orders may be above the estimated upper limit of the range. There is no guaranteed amount for the two one year option periods.<BR><BR>Only Architect or Engineering firms may compete for this contract per FAR 36.6.<BR><BR>Price will not be used as a criterion for selection.<BR><BR>Notice Organizational Conflict of Interest.  The work to be performed may create an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest on future acquisitions. Offerors should refer to FAR subpart 9.5 - ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  An organizational conflict of interest can arise when a contractor possesses an economic incentive that renders it unable, or potentially unable, to provide impartial assistance or advice; or an unfair competitive advantage in obtaining a contract as the result of access to nonpublic information about a competitor or procurement.  When an organizational conflict of interest arises it can have serious implications for the contractor that can range from disclosure obligations to disqualification from an award.  Accordingly, some restrictions on the future activities of the contractor and its subcontractors may be required.  And, these restrictions may include prohibiting the contractor or its subcontractors from participating in a contract or a task order. The contractor or their subs may not be part of the Design Builders engineers and architects of record on future contracts.  A contractor which participates in preparing design drawings or documents for future construction contracts may be prohibited from providing CPS for that contract.  However, in future procurements, the contractor or its subcontractors may request a determination of its ability to participate in a particular procurement from the Contracting Officer.  In the event this contract is used to develop design build supporting documents for use in a design build acquisition (FAR 36.302), the prime AE and sub consultants shall be prohibited from teaming with design build firms to compete in final design build construction solicitation in accordance with FAR 9.505-2. Proposals submitted for procurements or services for which the contractor or its subcontractor is later determined to have an organizational conflict of interest shall be submitted at the risk of the contractor or its subcontractors. b. Nature of Work: The services necessary for each requirement will be negotiated and awarded as individual task orders. The Architect Engineer (AE) shall furnish all personnel, labor, services, materials, supplies, office space, and supervision required to fully complete each task order. The AE firm(s) will act as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the U.S. Government and shall in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract furnish all labor and supervisory management required for the performance of the work that will be described in separately issued task order scopes of work. Task Orders issued against the contract awarded under this announcement may be used by other Corps of Engineers offices and other Department of Defense agencies. c. Contract Award Procedure: The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contract which may also include Time & Material items. Task Orders issued against the contracts awarded under this announcement may be used by other Corps of Engineers offices.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov  If a large business firm is selected for this announcement, it must comply with the FAR 52.219-9 clause regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for the Fort Worth District which will be considered in the negotiation of this acquisition are:  (1) at least 50.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB); (2) at least 17.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB); (3) at least 18.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Women-Owned SB (WOSB); (4) at least 4.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned SB; (5) at least 10.0% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with HUBZone SB, and at least 8.5% of a contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with Veteran-Owned SB. Additional Subcontracting Goal Considerations: Although the Department of the Army has not assigned goals in the subcontracting category of HBCU/MI, note that both the ISR and SSR Forms for subcontract reporting require "other than small" prime contractors to include HBCU/MI.  Therefore, the following guidance is provided:  In support of the HBCU/MI Program, contracts awarded that provide for HBCU/MI subcontracting opportunities should include a HBCU/MI subcontracting goal consistent with the anticipated subcontracting opportunities associated with work HBCU/MIs perform. The plan is not required as part of this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. Before a small disadvantaged business is proposed as a potential subcontractor, they must be certified by the Small Business Administration and registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Failure of a proposed small disadvantaged business to be certified by the Small Business Administration at the time the SF 330 is submitted will result in their elimination as a proposed subcontractor.  Professional Labor Rates will only be increased once every 12 months and any task order issued at any time within the 12-month period must use the rates of the period in which the task order is executed by the Contracting Officer. New rates go into effect only at the end of the 12 month period. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm Fixed Price contract. d. Program Intent: The AE firm(s) will act as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the U.S. Government and shall in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract furnish all labor and supervisory management required for the performance of the work that will be described in separately issued task order scopes of work. The task orders under the IDIQ contracts for design and construction phase services are required to support the military program and may include tasks supporting projects not yet in construction. Site design work under the Military Construction program for the Fort Bliss Expansion will be accomplished using the Land Development Engineering model developed for this size program on infrastructure and the Center for Standardization (COS) designs for the primary facilities.  To accomplish the site and infrastructure work, the service of a firm experienced in site design and Land Development Engineering (LDE) is desired.  The use of the terms AE firm and LDE will be synonymous throughout this announcement.  The LDE will become integrated in the government Project Delivery Team.  Task Orders issued under this contract will encompass all aspects of site development, site design, and the site integration.  The LDE will also provide man power to assist the Government with project management and construction management services. The AE must be able to provide design support and consultant services in various combinations of architectural, structural, civil, mechanical and electrical disciplines. The AE may be required to perform all or part of the following construction management, Request For Proposal preparation, design-bid-build efforts, and infrastructure design and development services. The specific nature of the work to be performed will be as contained within the individual task order scopes of work (SOW). If construction management services are required for new construction, renovation, repair, and maintenance of government facilities and infrastructure construction, construction management services include, but are not limited to, quality assurance during construction, program management of construction team, technical services, assessing technical requirements ,design during construction, ensure quality standards are met, allocate resources and direct LDE team effort, Develop LDE specific procedures and training programs, assist in development operation and implementation to meet objectives, review material submittals, review of LEED documentation during design and construction,  provide training for LEED during construction, review of as-built drawings, manuals, operating instructions, and other such materials required by the construction contract; constructability reviews of design drawings and specifications.  Additional Program Information: The Corps of Engineers' Centers of Standardization (COS) will be used for the construction of barracks, dining facilities, company operation facilities, headquarters buildings, vehicle maintenance shops, unit and ammunition storage facilities, aviation facilities, and equipment parking areas and other features of the program.  Under the COS process, Districts within the Corps of Engineers are assigned certain types of facilities and are responsible for awarding Design Build IDC contracts for their assigned type of facility.  When there is a requirement for a particular facility the LDE team may be asked to assist in the development of the Request for Proposal and any other work in support of the award of a construction task order to acquire the required facilities.  The COS will assist with the administration of the task order to include design reviews, submittals modifications, and maintain responsibility for keeping up with the current standards and criteria for their facility types.  The LDE will integrate and coordinate all infrastructure and site development facilities for each site.  The LDE may also be tasked to coordinate and work with the COS standard model RFP. e. Place of Performance:  The majority of the AE staff directly supporting the USACE Program Director, the Project Managers, and the associated construction office team through project integration and construction management services shall be located in the general proximity where the construction is being accomplished. In some cases, the on-site LDE staff may be housed in government furnished office space.  The physical location of the design team and those team members not directly supporting the onsite work can be located per the A E's preference. The LDE will be responsible for the costs and will be required to provide their own office accommodations for the on-site LDE staff (or where the work is being accomplished.)  The LDE must furnish their employee's transportation. <BR><BR> <BR>2.

<DESC>COMBINED PRESOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT AND ADVISORY MULTI-STEP NOTIFICATION FOR IDENTITY INTELLIGENCE (I2) BIOMETRICS SERVICES<BR><BR> 1.0	Description<BR>This publication serves as a combined pre-solicitation announcement and Advisory Multi-Step (AMS) notification by the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM).  INSCOM intends to issue a solicitation on behalf of the INSCOM G3 Biometrics Division.  This requirement will be solicited as a multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The award will be based on the best value to the Government. The exact closing date and time of the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be identified in the solicitation release.  It is the sole responsibility of the offeror to review the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) webpage frequently for any updates/amendments to the solicitation. All prospective offerors must have a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code and be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov . Interested vendors of this combined pre-solicitation AMS announcement should submit their Capabilities Statement with the intention of submitting a proposal. The respondent should possess NAICS Code 541690.  <BR>This combined pre-solicitation notice and AMS announcement requests corporate qualifications from offerors responding to the INSCOM I2 Biometrics Services Acquisition. This announcement requests information from prospective offerors allowing the INSCOM G3 Biometrics Division to review and assess the likelihood of each respondents ability to provide the services and supplies needed to fulfill the I2 Biometrics requirements. Based on an assessment of each prospective offerors response to this notice, the firm will be notified as to whether it is considered a viable competitor for the I2 Biometrics contract. Notification of a prospective offerors non-viability is advisory, and respondents so notified may submit proposals should they so choose. <BR>The authority and basis for utilizing the AMS process is contained in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.202. <BR>2.0 	Advisory Multi-Step (AMS)<BR>This combined pre-solicitation notice and AMS announcement is being conducted to allow potential offerors to submit qualifying documentation demonstrating their corporate qualifications which will allow the Government to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for the I2 (Biometrics) acquisition. The AMS process is accomplished at minimal cost to the potential offerors and the Government by asking interested organizations to submit limited information that focuses on their corporate capability and experience. The Government will assess all responses in accordance with the published criteria, and advise each offeror, in writing, whether they will be viable candidates.   Those offerors considered unlikely to be viable candidates will be notified and provided a general basis for that assessment. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government, respondents identified as unlikely to be viable competitors may still participate in the resultant acquisition, as long as they recognize the inherent risks and costs of doing so. <BR>3.0	 Introduction to the I2 Biometrics Acquisition<BR>INSCOMs intention is to continue acquisitions of I2 and Biometrics support services and technologies at the current contracted levels and at higher levels if required by future conditions, and also to provide the capability to acquire new I2 and Biometrics technologies and services as they become available in the marketplace through the contract resulting from this acquisition.<BR>3.1	 Identity Intelligence <BR>INSCOMs  Biometrics mission is to conduct I2 Operations to include staff oversight, biometrics and forensics analysis, tools, training, watchlist management and operational support to Department of Defense (DoD), interagency and multinational partners in denying adversaries anonymity. <BR>I2 is defined as the information produced by the discovery, management, and protection of identity attributes (the biographic, biometrics, behavioral, relational, and/or systemic characteristics, by which an individual, person, persona, system, or discrete group thereof, can be distinctly recognized or known) in support of U.S. national and homeland security interests. I2 provides critical intelligence information that helps map and understand the human terrain.  Analysis consists of the integration of Identity Intelligence efforts within DoD and the United States Government.  Current capabilities and future technologies will be utilized to identify critical intelligence gaps and develop and apply fixes, develop theater/regional watchlists, and develop all-source products that enhance I2 related efforts.<BR>4.0	Services to be Provided<BR>4.1	I2 Biometric Services<BR>Interested  offerors for the I2 Biometrics program will provide a complete range of technical and professional support to provide INSCOM a worldwide contract to help manage I2 (Biometrics).

<DESC><p>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI). This is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information for planning purposes only and constitutes neither a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment or payment for information by the Government for any purpose. The information requested will provide the Government (1) availability and capability of qualified sources; (2) identify small businesses, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, or small disadvantaged businesses, and (3) size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code.</p>
<p>The Air Armament Center, Range Instrumentation Systems, Eglin AFB, Florida, in coordination with Naval Air Systems Command PMA 205, is conducting market research to determine potential sources for a connector retrofit and cable manufacturing contract on the P5 Combat Training System/Tactical Combat Training System (P5 CTS/TCTS). P5 CTS/TCTS provides realistic Air Combat Training to the warfighter and employs instrumentation on high activity participant aircraft and ground subsystem components.</p>
<p>The Air System (AS) of the P5 CTS/TCTS, which hereafter shall be called, the "pod" contains seven (7) different types of branched wire harnesses. These harnesses allow various Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) to communicate mission data/parameters to the data recording device (DRD) and ground stations via a radio frequency (RF) link. The Sources Sought and Request for Information encompasses the integration of new connector back shells and jack screw connectors. These items will be provided as government furnished equipment (GFE) for the installation on the (GFE) branched wire harnesses. Additionally the effort will include a new build of a quantity of 50 cables with GFE connectors to be used as a rotable pool. The cable harnesses shall cycle to and from fielded units such that 50 pod sets of cable harnesses can be delivered to the contractor at a time for retrofit. The Government has cable schematics and a parts list. Harness routing boards as well as assembly instructions will have to be developed or reverse engineered by the prospective contractor/contractors.</p>
<p>The new effort will be called P5 CTS/TCTS Connector Retrofit and identified under the North American Industry Classification Code (NAIC): 335999 All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing, Federal Service/Supply Code: 6145. The Small Business Standard established for this NAIC is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>More specifically, the scope of the effort for the retrofitting activity would be as follows:</p>
<p>The contractor shall modify seven (7) different types of branched wire harnesses provided as GFE which equates to a total of twenty-three (23) back shells per set of cables. There are 1,300 of each type of cable which equates to a total of 9,100 harnesses or a grand total 29,900 back shell replacements. The cable harnesses will be provided to the contractor in a lot quantity of 50.</p>
<p>W1 harness - Remove five (5) each Positronic DXX000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with five (5) each DXX000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W1 harness has two size nine (9), one size twenty-five (25), one size thirty-seven (37), and one size fifty (50) back shells.</p>
<p>W2 harness - Remove three (3) each Positronic D9000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with three (3) each D9000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W2 harness has all size nine (9) back shells.</p>
<p>W3 harness - Remove four (4) each Positronic DXX000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with four (4) each DXX000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W3 harness has two size nine (9), one size fifteen (15), and one size twenty-five (25) back shell.</p>
<p>W4 harness - Remove two (2) each Positronic DXX000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with two (2) each DXX000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W4 harness has one size nine (9), and one size twenty-five (25) back shell.</p>
<p>W5 harness - Remove three (3) each Positronic DXX000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with three (3) each DXX000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W5 harness has two size nine (9), and one size thirty-seven (37) back shell.</p>
<p>W6 harness - Remove four (4) each Positronic DXX000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with four (4) each DXX000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W6 harness has one size nine (9), one size thirty-seven (37), and two size fifty (50) back shells.</p>
<p>W7 harness - Remove two (2) each Positronic D50000GVL0 slide lock type back shells and replace with two (2) each D50000GE0 screw-on type back shells. The W7 harness has all size fifty (50) back shells.</p>
<p>Each of the cable harnesses retrofitted with the GFE shall be replenished the non-conductive RTV (potting) prior to closing the back shells. The cable harnesses shall be electrically for continuity after each modification.</p>
<p>The scope for production effort would be as follows:</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is for market research purposes to determine if capable, qualified businesses possess the capability to provide the NPPTL physiology laboratory with a 34 zone, sweat capable, thermal manikin that can reflect changes in specific body parts (face, feet, dorsal part of hand, palms and others) to evaluate different clothing systems or personal protective equipment.
<p>Specifically, NPPTL is looking for a thermal manikin with sweating capability that has special software for interaction with a virtual human computer thermoregulatory model and provides a minimum of 34 zones. The combination of thermal manikin + thermoregulatory model provides a huge step forward in the ability to predict human comfort under a variety of clothing and environmental conditions. NPPTL will also need a transportation device for the thermal manikin that makes it easier to move from one place to another for different testing environments (e.g. chamber, laboratory).</p>
<p>Sources who believe that they possess the capabilities to provide the requested items are invited to submit their capabilities statement demonstrating their 34-zone, sweat capable, manikin with related software and transportation device.</p>
<p>Please limit your response to no more than three (3) pages (size: 8.5"x 11" pages, with 1" margins), using Times New Roman 12 pt font or equivalent, and submit in editable Microsoft Word 2003 or later or editable Adobe PDF formats.</p>
<p>As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a sole-source requirement.</p>

<SUBJECT>Behavioral and Serological Survey for HIV and Syphilis Among Prisoners and the Prison Community in Luanda, Angola
<SOLNBR>2011-94697
<RESPDATE>040711
<CONTACT>Gwendolyn Cody, Phone 7704882436, Email dvv1@cdc.gov
<DESC>Behavioral and Serological Survey for HIV and Syphilis <br />Among Prisoners and the Prison Community in Luanda, Angola
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>I. Introduction.</p>
<p>A contract for a behavioral and serologic surveillance study is needed to assist the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Government of the Republic of Angola through the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA in their collaborative efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Angola.</p>
<p>II. Background.</p>
<p>Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing HIV/AIDS services, CDC builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data for improved planning and program implementation. <br />Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. High risk sexual and other risky behaviors in prison settings increase the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. HIV risk in this population is aggravated by poor prison conditions which often lead to rape and sexual violence as well as the exchange of sex for basic needs. Thus, prisoners are a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting HIV and other STIs. Because most prisoners are released into society, there is a high risk of HIV transmission between prisons and the general population. <br />According to UNAIDS, there is insufficient knowledge about the prison community, both in and out of the correctional system. UNAIDS strongly recommends that sub-Saharan African countries take action to fill this information gap and use the information to better understand the national situation and develop effective policies and programs to support this population. As a first step, Angola will conduct a BSS survey for HIV and syphilis in the prison community. <br />III. Scope.</p>
<p>In the performance of this task, the contractor shall conduct a behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) study within the prison community in Luanda province of Angola. The contractor will also train INLS representatives in the process.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are to: <br />1. Examine attitudes, patterns of sexual behavior, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among male prisoners and prison staff; <br />2. To explore the relationship among socio-demographic, behavioral and contextual factors and HIV and syphilis prevalence; <br />3. Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence in the study population; and <br />4. Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys among most at risk populations for HIV.</p>
<p>IV. Project Summary.</p>
<p>The BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV. This effort requires the contractor to:</p>
<p>&bull; Conduct formative assessment to define logistical guidelines and appropriate procedures for implementation of the study;<br />&bull; Develop and ensure that appropriate confidentiality and data protection measures are in place ;<br />&bull; Develop the study protocol for approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards of the host government, CDC, and the contractor;<br />&bull; Develop a quality control plan to ensure that the requirements of the contract are met and adherence to the approved protocol as well as all local and U.S. human subjects protection requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop standard operation procedures based on the protocol</p>
<p>&bull; Implement the study according to the protocol;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and analyze the data;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop recommendations for HIV/AIDS intervention strategies and service delivery in prison settings based on those results;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate the study results and recommendations;</p>
<p>&bull; Train INLS staff in the survey methodology;</p>
<p>&bull; Support the Technical Advisory Committee led by the INLS; and</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborate with stakeholders.</p>
<p>V. Performance Period.</p>
<p>Start Date: Date of the Award</p>
<p>End Date: 12 months from date of CDC CGH ADS approval</p>

<DESC>Behavioral and Serological Survey for HIV and Syphilis <br />Among Diamond Mine Workers in Angola
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>I. Introduction.</p>
<p>A contract for a behavioral and serologic surveillance study is needed to assist the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Government of the Republic of Angola through the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA in their collaborative efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Angola.</p>

<p>Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing HIV/AIDS services, CDC builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data for improved planning and program implementation. Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. <br />This statement of objectives is for conducting a BSS among diamond mine workers. Studies have shown that HIV prevalence amongst women attending antenatal clinics is higher in areas around mines that use migrant labor as well as in areas from which mine workers are normally recruited. There are numerous factors that increase the risk of miners and the surrounding communities to HIV, including the following:<br />&bull; The mining sector employs mostly males aged between 18-49 years, who are in the prime of their sexual and reproductive lives.<br />&bull; Many of mine workers are migrants who have left their families in other areas.<br />&bull; Mining is a dangerous and risky environment. Persons working in such environments may have a different perception of risk to HIV infection. <br />&bull; Mine workers tend to have a higher income in relation to the communities in which they may live. This may result in transactional sex between mine workers and the local population, increasing the risk of HIV transmission.</p>
<p>Families and communities are burdened with the associated costs of care and funerals as well as increasing numbers of children orphaned by the pandemic. This will result in more household poverty and increased vulnerability to HIV by those affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. Scope.</p>
<p>In the performance of this task, the contractor shall conduct a behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) study among diamond mine workers in Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, Bie and/or Malange Provinces. The contractor will also train INLS representatives in the process.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are to: <br />1. Examine attitudes, patterns of sexual behavior, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among diamond mine workers; <br />2. To explore the relationship among socio-demographic, behavioral and contextual factors and HIV and syphilis prevalence; <br />3. Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence in the study population; and <br />4.

<p>&bull; Develop recommendations for HIV/AIDS intervention strategies and service delivery in the mining sector based on those results;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate the study results and recommendations;</p>
<p>&bull; Train INLS staff in the survey methodology;</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for Planar Targets
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI). The information received in response to this notice will be used for acquisition planning purposes. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and a formal solicitation for this effort is not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue a RFP, grant, order, or contract. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this notice, nor will the Government return any data provided.</p>
<p>I. Background/Justification: The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration has an ongoing need for a wide variety of very complex targets for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF), and related High Energy Density Physics (ICF/HEDP) experiments. ICF/HEDP targets are complex, multi-component, systems often employing specialized materials. This solicitation is for the delivery of planar (or flat) targets for the ICF/HEDP Program.</p>
<p>Planar are typically several mm in length and width, and can have thicknesses ranging from a few to several hundred microns. The surface of the planar target varies according to its specification. Some are flat and smooth, some have ripples, and some have random, but well-quantified, textures. Planar targets can also consist of multiple foils separated by gaps of 5 to 200 microns. Planar targets can be made from a single material, a mixed material, or composites of different materials. Planar targets can be made from plastics, metals, alloys, low density foams, and/or cryogenically cooled hydrogen and/or deuterium. Most targets are custom built to precise specifications for dimensions, flatness, shape (including prescribed curvature), thickness, and uniformity. In some cases the impurities and/or dopants must be controlled and known to less than a tenth of a percent. The primary experimental facilities that use planar targets are the NIF and Jupiter lasers at Livermore, the Trident Facility at Los Alamos, the Omega and Omega EP facilities at University of Rochester, and the Nike Laser at the Naval Research Laboratory. However virtually all the NNSA ICF/HEDLP facilities use planar targets. Planar targets must be fully measured and characterized to the precision necessary to show they meet the required specifications. An example of the type of characterization tools that must be brought to bear are white light interferometers, low energy x-ray radiography, atomic force microscopy, precision scales, and reflectometry. Despite these challenging requirements, predictable and timely delivery of these targets is essential for continuous and efficient operation of the related NNSA ICF facilities. Without a steady supply of these high precision targets, these facilities would suffer costly work stoppages. These targets have been supplied in the past by General Atomics and Schafer Corporation who each have functioning and capable design, engineering, manufacturing, and project management systems.</p>
<p><br />II. Solicitation Overview: The NAICS Code and Corresponding Size Standard for the contemplated procurement are: NAICS Code - 541712; Size Standard - 500 employees.<br /><br />The Summary Scope of Work is given below. The contractual effort is contemplated to be a 3-year period of performance for an anticipated value up to $4M. The contemplated contract type is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee level of effort. Work is expected to be conducted at the contractor's facilities, and at one or more of the participating national laboratories. Participation at meetings and conferences at other locations to be determined is required. The contractor must provide services in a fully integrated manner and on a timely basis.</p>
<p>III. Deliverables: In addition to delivery of targets, the contractor will be required to supply extensive documentation of the as-build dimensions and purities of each target. Reporting will include, but may not be limited to, detailed documentation of costs and program status reports.</p>
<p>IV. Summary Scope of Work [Also see Attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW)]: <br /><br />Planar Targets - This acquisition will provide planar targets for both intermediate and major facilities in the ICF programs in NNSA. These include, but are not limited to, the NIF and Jupiter facilities at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, the Omega laser at the University of Rochester, the Nike Laser at the Naval Research Laboratory, and the Trident laser at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Planar target support consists of three main tasks 1) the fabrication and delivery of flat targets and target components, 2) creating advanced flat target fabrication and characterization techniques, and 3) ICF Planar target supply integration, i.e. Project Management. Targets or target components can be delivered individually or in lot quantities. Here, "target components" refer to parts of a target (e.g. planar rippled foam sheets) that will be integrated with the end users own target components/infrastructure (e.g. cryogenic deuterium fill system) to fabricate a complete ICF target (in this case, a rippled foam sheet wicked with liquid deuterium). "Advanced target fabrication techniques" refers to the research and development needed to create a new technique for making or characterizing targets. The need for a particular technique will be provided by the end user, usually in the context of delivering a new type of target and/or one with specifications that are beyond the state of the art.</p>
<p>Specifications for planar targets are determined by the principal investigator (lead experimentalist) for each campaign, in consultation concerning the fabricability of the proposed design with the planar target support contractor. Physical delivery of targets and target components are the responsibility of the contractor. Note that most targets and target components are very fragile with delicate components. Some need to be kept at specific temperatures or in certain gas environments. Some need to be assembled on site or integrated with other target components on site.</p>
<p>Interested businesses should submit a capabilities statement not to exceed five (5) pages (if more than 5 pages are submitted the additional pages will not be read) that describes your interest, experience, and capabilities (personnel and facilities/equipment) to provide Planar Targets. In addition, please indicate your firm's size in relation to the NAICS Code and associated Size Standard listed above.</p>
<p>The Government will not respond to businesses that do not follow the submission instructions in this notice. The Government will evaluate each respondent's capabilities statement to</p>
<p>determine if the respondent has the requisite experience and past performance to complete the requirements described herein.</p>
<p>No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The Government does not commit to providing a response to any comment or question. No basis for a claim against the Government shall arise as a result of this notice.</p>
<p>Responses must be received prior to 2:00 PM Eastern Time (12:00 PM Mountain Time) on Monday, February 28, 2011. All responses must be submitted to Mr. Ray James Sisneros via e-mail at rsisneros@doeal.gov</p>
<p><br />NOTE:</p>
<p>1. This notice requests information for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>
<p>2. Information cited above is subject to change; please refer to a final RFP, if issued, for actual terms, conditions, and instructions.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice for National Laser Users' Facility (NLUF) Targets
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI). The information received in response to this notice will be used for acquisition planning purposes. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and a formal solicitation for this effort is not available at this time. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government to issue a RFP, grant, order, or contract. The Government will not pay for any effort expended or any material provided in response to this notice, nor will the Government return any data provided.</p>
<p>I. Background/Justification: The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has an ongoing need for a wide variety of very complex targets for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and related High Energy Density Physics (ICF/HEDP) experiments. An important part of the ICF program is the National Laser Users' Facility (NLUF) Program at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. The NLUF provides qualified university and industry researchers access to experimental shot time on the Omega Laser Facility. This provides a unique environment for experiments in inertial fusion and high energy density physics. Experimental time awarded through peer-reviewed NLUF solicitations has included investigations of inertial confinement fusion physics, laser-plasma interactions, laboratory astrophysics, properties of materials under extreme pressure conditions, XUV spectroscopy, high intensity laser-matter interactions, and instrumentation development. Many of the targets for NLUF experiments are provided through the planned solicitation described here.</p>
<p>NLUF targets are complex, multi-component, systems often employing specialized materials. Examples include spherical shells, machined components (cylinders, spheres and/or cones), simple and/or composite flat foils and supported foams. Typical materials in a target are plastics, metals, alloys, low density foams. The targets may be filled with a variety of gases. They may also be cryogenically cooled. Most targets are custom built to precise specifications: They have dimensions of only a few mm to 1 cm, require tolerances of a hundred nano-meters or better, and in some cases need control of impurities and/or dopants to less than a tenth of a percent. Equally important are the advanced techniques to characterize the targets to the same precision. Despite these challenging requirements, predictable and timely delivery of these targets is essential for continuous and efficient operation of the Omega Facility. Without a steady supply of these high precision targets, the NLUF program could suffer costly work stoppages.</p>
<p>II. Solicitation Overview: The NAICS Code and Corresponding Size Standard for the contemplated procurement are: NAICS Code - 541712; Size Standard - 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Summary Scope of Work is given below. The contractual effort is contemplated to be a 3-year period of performance for an anticipated value up to $4M. The contemplated contract type is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee level of effort. Work is expected to be conducted at the contractor's facilities, and at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE). Participation at meetings and conferences at other locations to be determined is required. The contractor must provide services in a fully integrated manner and on a timely basis.</p>
<p>III. Deliverables: In addition to delivery of targets, the contractor will be required to supply extensive documentation of the as-build dimensions and purities of each target. Reporting will include, but may not be limited to, detailed documentation of costs and program status reports.</p>
<p>IV. Summary Scope of Work [Also see Attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW)]<br /><br />National Laser Users' Facility (NLUF) Targets - This acquisition is to provide target support for the National Laser Users' Facility (NLUF) through a Target Support Contractor ("Target Contractor"). The NLUF provides qualified university and industry researchers access to experimental shot time on the Omega Laser Facility. This provides a unique environment for experiments in inertial fusion and high-energy-density physics. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) sponsors the NLUF at the University of Rochester's Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR/LLE). NNSA, through LLE, pays for the laser operations, and through direct funding, supports the NLUF Users as well as the Target Support Contractor. Research to be performed as part of the NLUF is determined by evaluation of proposals submitted to an independent committee and rank ordered based upon the merit review criteria in the solicitation.<br /><br />Target support consists of three main tasks: 1) the fabrication and delivery of targets and target components, 2) onsite target support activities, and 3) development of advanced target fabrication techniques for specific targets. Most targets and target components are custom built in very limited runs of a few to no more than 20. The target complexity can range from simple foils and spherical plastic shells to multi-component systems made from specialized materials. Typical components in a target are plastics, metals, alloys, low density foams. The targets may be filled with a variety of gases and, possibly, cryogenically cooled. The term "target components" refer to parts of a target (e.g. planar rippled sheets) that will be integrated with other target components (e.g. backlighter foils, shielding, and support components) to fabricate a complete target. NLUF targets must meet very precise specifications-typically they have internal dimensions of a few millimeters or smaller; require tolerances of a hundred nanometers or better; and in some cases need control of impurities and/or dopants to less than a tenth of a percent. Equally important are the advanced techniques needed to characterize the targets to the same precision. "Onsite target support activities" refers to the contractor's target fabrication personnel onsite, at UR/LLE, who participate in the final assembly, characterization, and deployment of the target. "Advanced target fabrication techniques" refers to the research and development needed to create a new technique for making or characterizing targets.</p>
<p>Specifications for NLUF targets are determined by the NLUF users, in consultation concerning the fabricability of the proposed design with the NLUF target support contractor.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries, located in Miami, FL intends to acquire services to perform monitoring of the fish community of the coastal wetlands of Biscayne Bay. DESC: This is a notice to acquire services to perform monitoring of the fish community of the coastal wetlands of Biscayne Bay. Introduction This project will develop and refine performance measures to evaluate the success of ecosystem restoration efforts in the Biscayne Bay coastal area, establish pre-CERP reference conditions and variability for the performance measures and related physical parameters, determine the status and trends of performance measures, determine cause and effect relationships, acquire information to interpret unexpected responses of the ecosystem to changes resulting from CERPs activities, and increase understanding of the ecosystem. The project that will monitor the fish community to document the changes in the demersal fish community that will be associated with restoration activities. A conceptual model suggests that freshwater flow to the coastal wetlands will result in lower and more stable salinity regimes which will increase wetland production and ultimate will result in increased nesting of wading birds (specifically the project examines roseate spoonbills which have been demonstrated to be an indicator for numerous other species&mdash;see Lorenz et al 2009a). Since 2002, dwarf mangrove wetlands that line the mainland of Southern Biscayne Bay have been monitored by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA/NMFS) in collaboration with the Dr. Jerome Lorenz of Tavernier Science Center, (Lorenz et al. 2006) to evaluate the demersal prey base fish community in reference to salinity and water levels that fluctuate on inter-annual and seasonal cycles. Sampling will be conducted in the southern Biscayne Bay mainland coastal wetlands at four locations: Manatee Bay, Barnes Sound, Card Sound, and Turkey Point. Sampling will be conducted at least once at each location within the following periods for a complete year. Sampling results will be examined in relation to results from previous work at four other coastal wetland sites that have been sampled since the early 1990s (Lorenz et al. 1997, Lorenz 1999). Work plan requirements: Tasks associated with this project include development of a work plan (including provision for quality assurance and control (QA/QC)), sampling according to a schedule consistent with sampling at these sites in previous years and in the wetlands of northeastern Florida Bay, analysis of the data, quarterly progress reports, annual reports, and a final summary report at the project end if the project is not continued. With the annual report should be spreadsheets of all data collections following QSAR standards. The work plan and sampling must include, at a minimum, the following activities, applied in time and space. -A 9-m2 drop net method developed for sampling fish in the coastal creek/open wetland flats type of habitat will be used to sample small demersal fish effectively and without bias. -Nets will be set up, left in place overnight, and deployed the following day within 2 hrs after sunrise. Each net will surround an individual dwarf mangrove tree, thereby sampling both prop-root habitat and the open area between trees. -Trees for sampling will be selected so that each site has a similar array of tree sizes with roughly equivalent prop-root density sampled between sites. -Six nets will be used during each sampling trip, three in each sub-habitat (flats and creek). -Samples will be collected at each site eight times per hydrologic year (defined as June 1 to May 31) in June, September and monthly from November through April. -Fish will be cleared from the net using rotenone, a fish toxicant. As described by Lorenz et al. (1997), measures will be taken to avoid or minimize bi-kill. Fish missed in the initial collection day will be collected the following day when they float to the surface. -Net clearing efficiencies will be estimated using mark and recapture techniques. Previous studies indicate that efficiency ranged from 78% to 90% for the most common fish species and averaged 86% for all marked and recaptured fish (Lorenz et al. 1997). -All fish collected will be identified, weighed, and measured. Weights for specimens collected during the second collection day will be calculated from length-weight regressions generated from the first day&rsquo;s collection. -Water level (stage) and salinity will be recorded in order to relate changes in the fish community to changes in hydrology (Lorenz 1999). Dissolved oxygen, rainfall, and pH are other critical parameters to fish that will be monitored. Data will be received daily from the Hydrolab stations and will be maintained for analysis. The data acquired from the above tasks will be entered into a database and files will be prepared for analysis. Analytical methods will include community analysis and ordination, multivariate analysis, ANOVA, and general linear modeling. Results of these analyses will be used to describe baseline characteristics and variability, identify plausible cause and effect relationships, and develop performance measures. The contract period is one year after contract award. Minimum Qualifications Required: Experience working with combination of 3 x 3 meter drop nets and rotenone. Experience working in ecotone between mangroves and freshwater wetlands Demonstrated ability to determine fish abundance in areas of fluctuating water levels. Integration with ongoing sampling that uses the same method in the southern Everglades. Experience in the operation, maintenance, and collection of data from established Hydrolabs at the study sites. Demonstrated ability to relate fish dynamics to the dynamics of reproduction in roseate spoonbills. Familiarity with reporting needs for system status reports for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project. The government knows of only one source Tavernier Science Center (TSC) of Audubon of Florida, Dr. Jerome Lorenz capable of providing this service: Dr. Lorenz has been conducting research in south Florida on coastal fish communities in relation to water and salinity patterns since 1989 and has a dissertation and several scientific papers on the topic. Dr. Lorenz established 8 sampling stations in coastal wetlands of southeastern Florida, developed a sampling protocol, and has been applying is since 1990 at 5 stations. The sampling protocol that is required is unique and particularly applicable to coastal wetlands of south Florida, where sampling and analysis of the samples collected is extremely difficult due to the soft, highly fragile terrain and the fluctuating water levels that affect the estimation of faunal density. Dr. Lorenz is the only known researcher applying this protocol, which is logistically complex. The National Marine Fisheries Service is obligated to provide sampling results for a System Status Report early in calendar 2012, followed by a full report. Failure to complete this project on schedule would erode the NOAA relationship with other agencies participating in the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration effort and reduce NOAA&rsquo;s prestige in the south Florida Ecosystem Restoration community. Failure to complete the project on schedule could prevent NOAA from providing information to Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan and the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project in time for the information to be used. This could jeopardize the ability to define and protect Biscayne Bay&rsquo;s fresh water needs and allow further degradation of the Biscayne Bay ecosystem. To be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the services and satisfy or exceed the Government&rsquo;s needs. Such information shall include, at a minimum, name, telephone number and address of concerns for whom you have furnished this type of services previously, and detailed narrative that described your facility and ability to provide this service, along with the individual work knowledge and experience. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. The government knows of only one source. The government invites firms that believe they have the capability to meet the requirement to response, providing specific information that will enable the government to determine whether or not to compete the requirement. Faxed information can be sent to 816-274-6983 or physically sent Department of Commerce, Attn: Sharon Walker, 601 E. 12th St, Room 1756, Kansas City, MO 64106.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement for U.S. Embassy Youth Book Program. <br />This is a sources sought synopsis to conduct market research for developing a procurement strategy for an upcoming BPA. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) seeks to gather information from industry, which will be used for planning purposes for the procurement of services in the area book anthologies for U.S. Embassies around the world. The value of the effort is anticipated to be $5 million over 5 years. This notice is for market research purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Quote or Request for Proposal; and, it is not considered to be a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result from a response to this Sources Sought notice or Government use of any information provided. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of potentially qualified small business, women-owned small business, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or HUB Zone prime contractor business sources to complete the effort. At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The Government reserves the right to consider any arrangement as deemed appropriate for this procurement, including the ultimate acquisition approach. Responses to the Sources Sought Synopsis should be received as soon as possible but no later than 10:00 am (local Washington, D.C. time) on 24 February 2011.

This is a network of about 400 partnerships between the Public-Affairs Sections of U.S. embassies/consulates, and host-country libraries and organizations. According to an agreement established in a Memorandum of Understanding, each embassy/consulate partner provides the American Corner with books, journals, and electronic resources, Because youth are a primary AC target audience, ACs need extensive youth-oriented collections. Because many of the embassies' American Centers and Information Resource Centers also target youth, they also procure items from the Embassy Youth Book Program. Many U.S. embassies wishing to make book donations to host-country institutions obtain the books from the Embassy Youth Book Program. <br />The Materials Development and Review Branch (ECA/A/L/M) coordinates English language teaching programs and provides appropriate materials for those programs. <br />Need: To satisfy the collection requirements of the American Corners and Centers, requirements which include the teaching of English, the Information Resource Centers, and the Binational Centers, and the Embassies' Public Diplomacy Officers demand for high-quality youth material focusing on U.S. history, culture, and values, the Embassy Youth Book Program was established in 2003. ECA/A/L/M formerly had a separate BPA which expired at the end of February, 2010. ECA/A/L/M now wishes to partner with IIP/IR in establishing a new, joint BPA. The needs of the two offices are similar as they serve complementary audiences and are involved in the promotion of English-language learning. <br />Responsibilities: The following are the duties that the Embassy Youth Book Program Contractor must perform. <br />Identify and supply a variety of new and current monographs, pertaining to the specific non-fiction topics that Embassy Public Affairs Sections emphasize in their public diplomacy outreach.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. This is not a request for offers or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool being utilized to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing a Request for Qualifications. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for information received as a result of this announcement. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.<br />The General Services Administration ("GSA") Northeast and Caribbean Region is conducting a market survey and is seeking sources for General Contractor services. The requirements for this opportunity include the construction of a new Security Entrance Pavilion at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Federal Courthouse, New York, New York. The project will involve the construction of a new Security Entrance Pavilion approximately 4500 square feet located on the west raised terrace of the existing Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse. The new Entrance Pavilion will have a minimum queuing capacity of 220 visitors and two screening stations within the Pavilion. Additionally, modifications to the existing Pearl Street security screening station will be made to improve circulation. The project is anticipated to begin around February 2012.<br />The current estimated construction cost range is $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. The estimated project duration (construction) is 18 months (540 days) after Notice to Proceed (NTP). The North American Industry System (NAICS) code for this effort is 236220 and the Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard is $33.5 million dollars in annual receipts averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years. The services for this project will include providing all construction related services including providing labor, materials and equipment required to complete the project as per contract documents prepared by an independent Architect/Engineer firm. The project will require work to be performed outside and within an occupied Federal Courthouse building while minimizing disruptions to the operations of the existing facility. <br />The Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse houses the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. District Court of Southern New York is the oldest and most high profile district court in the nation. The courthouse is 27 stories tall. It is made of granite, marble, and mahogany. The 974,000 square feet federal courthouse contains 44 courtrooms and provides court support and administrative services to the United States Marshals Service and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The courthouse also features two works by notable artists. In the main lobby sits "Justice" by Ray Kaskey, while the sculpture "Sounding Stones" by Maya Lin graces the western plaza.<br />For this effort, the Northeast and Caribbean Region is also seeking information on experienced General Contracting firms that qualify under the 8(a) Program, the HUBZone Program and/or the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Procurement Program. The North American Industry Classification System Code for this potential acquisition is 236220. The Small Business size standard is average annual sales and receipts for the past three years that are less than $33,500,000.00.<br />If you are an interested General Contractor, please provide with your Written Letter of Interest a response to the following questions. All information submitted is subject to verification. Additional information may be requested to substantiate responses. <br />1. Do you meet the Small business standard (average annual receipts less than $33,500,000.00 for the past three years)? Otherwise, indicate that you are a large business firm. <br />2. Is your firm an 8(a), Hubzone Small Business and/or Service Disabled Veteran- Owned Small Business (Please indicate the applicable representation(s))? (For additional information on small business size standards and small business programs, please visit www.sba.gov) <br />3. In the past twelve (12) years, has your firm completed any projects over $5,000,000 demonstrating similar experience with either courthouse construction, office building construction, security pavilion construction or a major building addition to an office building or other institutional building. If yes, please provide a brief description of that experience.<br />4. Has your firm completed or have in progress a project over $5,000,000 that is registered with the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) as having obtained or scheduled to obtain LEED certification?<br />Interested General Contracting firms should submit a Written Letter of Interest along with a response to the questions contained within this notice to Judy Lee, Contract Specialist. Please FAX your response to 212-264-0588, Attn: Judy Lee or submit through email to judy.lee@gsa.gov by February 25, 2011. For additional information regarding this potential opportunity, please contract Ms. Lee at (212) 264-4026.

Veteran Relationship Management
Telephone Service Transformation Project
Forecasting, Scheduling and Staffing
Request for Information (RFI)
Department of Veterans Affairs

Background: 
The Veteran Relationship Management (VRM) Program was established in response to several key challenges that Veterans, service members, and their dependents experience when seeking information and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Modernization of our telephony capabilities and our agents' ability to resolve Veteran's issues is a primary focal point of the VRM program.  As such, the VA Telephone Service Transformation VRM (VTST) project was established under VRM in response to Secretary Shinseki's interest in having a plan developed that charts a course for transformation of the VA call centers.  

 VTST will chart a course to answer the phones consistently and efficiently and to provide an accurate and complete answer. The overarching goal of this project is to provide world-class customer service, reasonable wait times, stellar quality, and a consistent overall call experience across all Administrations and all lines of business.  
Statement of the Problem: 
The VA seeks to implement a standardized enterprise wide Forecasting, Scheduling and Staffing solution (aka a WFM solution) to support world class Veteran support, and support multiple consolidated regional and national contact center queues and standalone local contact centers.  Any potential solution will need to be compatible with multiple telephony systems and various contact management software.  
Currently the majority of VA contact centers operate independently or at a semi-regional capacity.  Due to a lack of standardization, each center, or region, has developed independent WFM and telephony solutions.  Current solutions range from literally no WFM functionality, to simple spreadsheets, to full blown forecasting, scheduling and staffing solutions including dedicated WFM staff.  
The VA is evaluating the need for a standardized WFM package that is flexible and robust enough to handle large scale enterprise solutions (virtual teams) or local solutions with just a few agents.   
For the purposes of the analysis, and this RFI request, the VA is defining contact center size as:

Small 2 - 25 Contact Representatives  
Medium   26 - 100 Contact Representatives  
Large - Over 100 contact representatives

Capabilities:
Any proposed WFM solution should contain the following capabilities:

1.	Forecasting (both intraday and long term, by 15 min increments) 
2.	Scheduling (by 15min increments)
3.	Comprehensive WFM Simulation Modeler with the ability to adjust inputs in order to calculate various outputs.  Examples include, but are not limited to; staffing levels, handle times, service levels, call volume, abandon rates, trunk lines, occupancy, etc..
4.	Real time adherence monitoring
5.	Self service vacation planner and absence management
6.	Automated agent metrics and reporting
7.	Automated schedule reports
8.	Occupancy rates
9.	Automated skill (split) assignment based on schedule
10.	Self service tour exchange
11.	Web chat support
12.	Virtual staff support

Supporting Information:
The VA anticipates call volumes of at least 300,000,000 calls/year.  The VA is currently analyzing all Veteran communication systems at a local, regional and enterprise level.  This analysis includes telephony systems, and web based communication methods to a lesser degree.  The VA has over 1,300 medical centers, outpatient clinics, Veteran Centers, benefit centers and national clinical and business lines.  Most of these facilities host a contact center that range in size from one or two part time agents to over 400 full time employees.  Each of these facilities could potentially be impacted by the outcome of this analysis.  

Any potential WFM solution will need to be either:
a.	Scaleable from small independent local centers to large (100+ agents) enterprise level (virtual team) or multi facility operations.
b.	Or targeted to specific sized contact centers as identified in the Statement of Problem section.

A focal point of the VRM Program is the most common channel of access commonly used by our clients; the telephone.  Key to achieving the quality of service level expected of our clients when communicating with our contact center agents will be to modernize our telephony capabilities and provide our agents with a view of Veteran data to triage the most common inquiries from a single graphical user interface to increase first contact resolution.
Contact center modernization will require a stable, scalable technology infrastructure and a business process that empowers our agents to address inquiries more efficiently.  Moreover, the infrastructure and processes should be field tested in an environment which will allow the employment and refinement of best practices, which will result in a higher quality of client service interaction.
The system and any of its components must comply with the following technical standards: 
o Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998
o National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): Special Publication 800-53 Revision 3, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations" dated August 2009, 
o Veteran Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA).

The VA has identified the following strategic business objectives that are critical to the success of the Telephone Service Transformation project:
Improve consistency and quality across all Veteran interfaces
Provide efficient, effective, Veteran-focused service
Streamline and improve internal processes
The key benefits of implementing a standardized WFM solution will offer VA both internal and external benefits. 
Internal Benefits:
Increase productivity and streamline processes by eliminating redundant data entry and minimizing error.
Reduce call duration by reducing the idle time logging into systems and improving first call resolution through data integration and intelligent KM.
Improve quality of responses by reducing chance of errors caused by difficulty in access of system data.
Decrease the time that a customer is put on hold due to difficulty navigating all the different applications to locate information to resolve issues.
Ease of use and simplified training approach.
External Benefits:
Enhance the customer experience across all organizations by providing the best possible service and quickly resolving issues.
VA is seeking product information focusing on the above benefits. VA requests interested WFM product providers to complete responses for the following three questions based upon the attached 'Capability Matrix' spreadsheet:

Does your product/product line provide the described functionality? What specific product component provides it?
If the functionality is a discriminator in the market place for your product what discriminating functionality makes it stand out from similar functionality in other products?
For product discriminator functionality, provide current product technical documentation (include documents reference and copies of specific pages from user guide, programming interface manual, or other product information).

Additionally, responses to the following two general questions are sought:
Describe the applications and user community of your three largest, enterprise-wide customers, both government and commercial.
If requested, and with a signed non-disclosure agreement, may the Government review technical documentation (user guides, design/architecture guides, programming guides) for your products(s)?

Responding to this RFI:
Responses shall be submitted in the form of a "white paper.  Responses should be identified with RFI VA118-11-RI-0174 and include company name, company address, Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and/ Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code (if applicable) and denote the business size for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 (Custom Computer Programming Services). The Government is open to considering teaming and prime/subcontractor relationships for future development and deployment.  Also, please indicate if you, your teammates and/or subcontractors are a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) or a Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB). Any questions regarding this RFI must be submitted via email to Contracting Officer, Anne Marie Vasconcelos, anne.vasconcelos@va.gov and Contract Specialist, Sarah Basilotto, sarah.basilotto@va.gov.  Responses should be limited to forty (40) pages, no more than twenty (20) single spaced pages, font size no less than 10, for each solution. The functional requirements matrix is not included in the page limit.

VA Telephone Service Transformation
Interactive Voice Response
Request for Information (RFI)

Background: 

The Veteran Affairs Telephone Service Transformation (VTST) was established in response to several key challenges that Veterans, service members, and their dependents experience when seeking information and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  Modernization of our telephony capabilities and ability to resolve Veteran's issues is a primary focal point of the VTST program.  As such VTST project was established under VRM in response to Secretary Shinseki's interest in having a plan developed that charts a course for transformation of the VA call centers.  

VTST will chart a course to answer the phones consistently and efficiently and to provide an accurate and complete answer. The overarching goal of this project is to provide world-class customer service, reasonable wait times, stellar quality, and a consistent overall call experience across all Administrations and all lines of business.  

Statement of the Problem: 

VA seeks to implement an enterprise wide IVR service which will provide world class Veteran support, and empower the Veteran to seek self service with consistent timely responses to Veteran selections and verbal requests.  The IVR system will overlay all of the VA existent IVR systems and auto attendants.  The IVR service will also provide an environment for supporting rapid functional enhancements to the IVR.  The IVR will have interfaces with and integrations to the Voice Access Modernization (VAM) project.  The VAM is a services based contract for Hosted Intelligent Call Routing (HICR), call recording and a hosted Like-for-Like translation of the existent National Automated Response System (NARS).  The NARS is a menu based touch tone and limited voice response IVR.
 
This RFI is for three solutions: 
"	Hosted IVR within the existent VAM
"	Hosted IVR Software as a Service

COTS Hosted IVR Service 
Alternative one(1) to be considered is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) IVR to operate within the existent call routing environment as implemented by the Voice Access Modernization (VAM) project.

Hosted IVR Software as a Service
Alternative two (2) to be considered is a hosted, or Software as a Service (SaaS), solution for the IVR.  The IVR would be hosted within a secure private environment and interface across the existent call routing environment as implemented by the VAM project.

 
Capabilities regardless of solution:

General Business and Operational Requirements:
"	Interoperability with existing HCIR and telephony systems.
"	Veteran self service selections (request delivery or direct agent assist), 
"	Speech enabled or touch tone responses.
"	Query the caller for the VA service they wish to access
o	Example: Ask the caller if the question is health or benefits or cemetery, then a few more focused questions in those areas - and then depending on the answers, the IVR will look at the caller's area code or an entered zip code - and send that caller to either NCA, VBA 800-827-1000, Education, LGY, or HRC, or any of the VAMC locations.
"	Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for multiple language selection (initially English and Spanish) and verbal commands by the caller. 
"	Text to speech responses for visually the impaired
"	Flexibility to make updates to the menu on demand or a scheduled basis, by local or system administrators,
"	User requested call back (scheduled or automatic based on queue time), 
"	IVR usage reports. 
"	Integration with existing VA data sources to fetch, update and convey data to the caller.
"	Scalable to meet increasing demand.
o	The VA anticipates total call volumes as approximately 70,000,000/year.  
o	The VA has over 1,300 medical centers, outpatient clinics, Veteran Centers, benefit centers and national clinical and administrative business lines.  
o	Agent staffing ranges from small independent local centers to large (100+ agents) enterprise level (virtual team) operations.
o	For the purposes of the analysis, and this RFI request, the VA is defining contact center size as:
"	Small  5 - 25 Contact Representatives
"	Medium   26 - 100 Contact Representatives
"	Large - Over 100 contact representatives

Requirements for the User/Veteran:
"	IVR Self Service options available 24 hours, 7 days a week.
"	User identification and verification for entry into the IVR 
"	External users shall have the option to complete surveys via multiple channels.
"	External users shall be able to disconnect and reconnect when their place in the queue is reached.
"	External users shall be able to navigate the menus using key words and phrases, as prompted by the IVR

Requirements for operation and administration:
"	The IVR service and application shall provide IVR responses to external users dependent on the time of day, for options to contact agents or counselors.
"	The IVR service and application shall be able to track and view IVR Usage and effectiveness.
"	Rapid enhancements and changes to the menu in real time and scheduled for special announcements and contingencies.
"	Near-real time editing for enhancements and changes to the IVR logic and routing.

IVR Survey management and operation:
"	The IVR service and application shall have the ability to develop surveys using configurable input structures allowing multi-level conditionals to develop inference-type survey questionnaires.
"	The IVR shall have the ability to accept responses using DTMF or ASR input from caller during survey.

Supporting Information:

Currently Integrated Voice Response (IVR) support is provided by Verizon using the Networx contract service vehicle.  The existing National Automated Response System (NARS) provides limited speech recognition for menu selections or touch tone selection.  The system does not provide for externally selected call backs, surveys, multi-language or ASR.  The VA anticipates that most development costs will be borne by the eventual provider with the appropriate chargeback to the VA based on some vendor provided usage algorithm. 

The system and any of its components must comply with the following Technical and Security standards as well as any other standards identified by the VA and the vendor: 

"	Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998
"	National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): Special Publication 800-53 Revision 3, "Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations" dated August 2009
"	Veteran Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA).
"	The IVR system will adhere to all VA security requirements. Based on Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 199 and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-60, recommended Security Categorization is Medium.

NOTE: From a security point of view, the application must support veteran identity and Access management. There is a need to guarantee that Personal Information Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is correctly secured and managed; accordingly the IVR must interface into the VA security infrastructure.  PII data used within any proposed solution will remain within the VA secured network.

<SUBJECT>RFI - SYSTEMS AND MODULAR MANUFACTURERS

<CONTACT>Traci Hamilton, Contract Specialist, Email traci.hamilton@wpafb.af.mil - Joshua L Holbrook, Contract Officer, Email joshua.holbrook@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>This RFI is limited to manufacturers of systems and modular furniture. If you are a dealer or distributor of systems and modular furnishings, please forward this RFI to the systems and modular furniture manufacturers(s) your company represents. The Air Force is requesting one (1) RFI submission package per systems and modular furnishings manufacturer. RFI responses from dealerships will not be reviewed.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION
<p>The United States Air Force (USAF) Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) Furnishings Commodity Council is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for procuring systems and modular furniture. The chosen strategy would provide an enterprise wide, continental United States (CONUS), solution for systems and modular furniture.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>To aid in the development of the acquisition strategy, the ESG Furnishings Commodity Council is investigating the availability of systems and modular furniture manufacturers, furnishing trends, and cost saving opportunities. Currently, the Air Force has 71 CONUS procurement offices buying systems and modular furniture with a historical spend of approximately $50M annually.</p>
<p>The Air Force has structured this Request for Information (RFI) to target industry feedback on a draft set of requirements. The attachments were developed based on analyzing the Air Force's systems and modular furnishings needs, anticipated furnishing demands and current procurement processes. As a component of the future strategy the Air Force anticipates implementing e-procurement. This is expanded upon in the E-Procurement Overview section of this RFI.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds. Offerors are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for the Government to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the submittals. We highly encourage all interested manufacturers to provide a complete and thorough response to this RFI, however not responding will not preclude participation should a solicitation be released. Please monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website for future information pertaining to this potential requirement.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>The ESG Furnishings Commodity Council is requesting your input to gather information to help us refine our requirements and to identify qualified manufacturers who might be able to meet our future requirements. This RFI allows manufacturers the opportunity to provide input and recommendations consistent with their product line offering, industry trends, and cost saving suggestions. All manufacturers with an appropriate product relating to the requirements set forth in the Requirements Matrix attached hereto are invited to provide data on the capabilities of your company. In addition to the attached documents, please provide a point of contact (POC) within your company, your company's cage code and DUNS number, and your company's number of employees. General questions or comments concerning the RFI or e-procurement should be submitted via e-mail.</p>
<p>This RFI includes three sections with attachments:<br />1)Requirements Matrix (attachment 1)<br />2)Dealership/Installation Location Matrix (attachment 2)<br />3)Reporting Requirements Matrix (attachments 3A, 3B, 3C)</p>
<p>The Air Force will not accept or acknowledge: e-mails over 2MB, brochures, samples, catalogs and any other marketing solicitation information.</p>
<p>POINT OF CONTACT:</p>
<p>Responses are due no later than 24 Feb 10@ 2300 EST. Responses received after this date may be considered. Responses or questions should be submitted by email to the following mailbox:</p>
<p>Furnishings.cc@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>If the mailbox is unavailable, questions can be forwarded to the following:</p>
<p>Contract Administrator:<br />Traci Hamilton<br />1940 Allbrook Ave., Bldg 1, Room 24<br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433<br />Email: Traci.Hamilton@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Alternate:<br />Contracting Officer:<br />Joshua Holbrook<br />1940 Allbrook Ave., Bldg 1, Room 24<br />Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433<br />Email: Joshua.Holbrook@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Verbal questions will NOT be accepted, accordingly, responses shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>E-PROCUREMENT OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The Air Force is in the final stages of implementing a new e-procurement tool called "AFWAY II". This new application will establish a "store-like" environment for AF buyers to purchase certain kinds of installation goods and services. In terms of functionality, it is similar to other commercial "shop and buy" e-purchasing sites available on the Internet. This new tool will allow the Air Force to more aggressively manage cost by restricting the choices buyers will have when they need to make purchases (e.g. furnishings). This new tool will also help capture a large share of Air Force's overall spend by manufacturer and product.</p>
<p>To support the shopping and e-ordering capability within this tool, supplier agreements (pricing, terms, etc) will need to be loaded into AFWAY II. Future awardees will be required to provide an electronic catalog for all of the contract items they will be selling to the Air Force. The catalogs will need to include a digital picture as well as complete information on each product.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FOR SUBMITTAL OF ATTACHED DOCUMENTS</p>

<DESC>The United States Department Of Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC) intends to make a sole source award to IDEXX LABORATORIES, Westbrook, ME. for the purchase of a Procyte DX Hematology Analyzer requires only 30 ul of anticoagulated blood and sample tube is returned in 30 seconds for futher&nbsp;<br />testing. The machine only takes two minutes to run entire sample from start to finish. The hematology analyzer uses three technologies (Laser flow cytometry, optical fluorescence and&nbsp;Laminar Flow Impedance TM)&nbsp;in one for most accurate results. Laser flow cytometry delivers and advance five-part white blood cell differential. The ProCyte Dx analyzer uses fluorescence to perform a full analysis of multiple characteristics on each white blood cell for the most accurate interpretation of all five white blood cell types. Optical fluorescence provides an absolute rticulocyte count and accurate platelet count, with no interference from large red blood cells or clumped platelets. This is the only machine on the market besides the advanced clinical pathology laboratory analyzers that can provide a true absolute reticulocyte count in a portable analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dx offers further specificity when analyzing the components of the white blood count.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) anticipates hosting a Pre-Solicitation Conference in support of the Corporate Investments Department's (CID) Investment Risk Management System (IRMS), tentatively scheduled for Thursday, March 3, 2011 at the PBGC Headquarters, 1200 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005-4026.
<p>The IRMS will be an externally hosted, web-based system that is secure, reliable, flexible, and easy-to-use. It must provide the capability to measure, report, and manage absolute investment risk (e.g., standard deviation, value-at-risk, et al) and relative investment risk (e.g., beta, tracking risk, et al) of the entire PBGC investment program and its various components including, but not limited to, asset classes, portfolios, and investment securities. The IRMS must relate investment risk to corresponding investment returns and report risk-adjusted investment performance and various statistical measures commonly used to characterize such performance. It must also have look-through capability to determine and report total exposure to a security, group of securities, industry, country, currency, or other common factor, and properly account for fixed income, public equities, and private market assets.</p>
<p>PBGC's goal with the Pre-solicitation Conference is to provide a forum to better communicate&nbsp;the Corporate Investments Department&nbsp;and the Office of Information Technology's requirements and increase competition by sharing information.</p>
<p>The anticipated timeframe for release of the IRMS Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and Pre-Solicitation Conference details is on or about February 15, 2011. The Government requests that industry utilize the FedBizOpps as their source for obtaining updates to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price purchase order to the Bristol Bay Native Association.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska requires the services of conducting harvest surveys in communities of the Bristol Bay Region.
Supporting Information
The 1997 Protocol Amendment to the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty between the US and Canada provides for a regulated spring/summer subsistence harvest.  This treaty amendment lays the legal groundwork for the tripartite Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council (Council) consisting of Federal, State, and Native regional partners.  The accompanying report to the amended treaty specifies: the need for harvest monitoring and that harvest estimates will be collected cooperatively by the Council, including: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and Native regional partners.
The March 28, 2000, Federal Register notice, Establishment of Management Bodies in Alaska to Develop Recommendations Related to the Spring/Summer Harvest of Migratory Birds, (Volume  65, No. 60) states that annual funding agreements with Alaska Native organizations, ADF&G, and others will be used to accomplish harvest monitoring.  This Federal Register notice listed the 12 Native regional partner organizations, including the Bristol Bay Native Association (BBNA), on page 16,408.  The April 8, 2002, Federal Register Notice, Procedures for Establishing Spring/Summer Subsistence Harvest Regulations for Migratory Birds in Alaska, establishes the program structure for the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council (Council).  It states in section (c), Roles and Responsibilities, that the Council will develop recommendations for harvest monitoring, and will establish committees to gather or review data.  A  BBNA representative is on the Council, and a BBNA representative is Chairperson of the Council's Harvest Survey Technical Committee.  BBNA is a non-profit organization that represents the interest of tribes/villages in their region through tribal resolutions that authorize them to act in their behalf in matters such as household surveys.  Another organization would not have this authority in their region.
The BBNA has a harvest monitoring system already in place in the Bristol Bay region, which monitors harvests of several other wildlife and fish species.  This includes contacts in its member villages, and an office in Dillingham with trained and experienced harvest survey personnel.  In addition to the fact that the BBNA is a regional partner organization of the Council which is legally charged with gathering the data, it will be most cost efficient to use BBNA's existing system rather than setting up a duplicative system.
Description of Work:
Collect bird and egg subsistence harvest information in villages of the North Slope region for the spring (Apr 1 - Jun 30), summer (Jul 1 - Aug 31), fall (Sept 1 - Oct 31), and winter (Nov 1 - March 9) survey periods.  Period of Performance is from date of awad to March 31, 2012.
This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals adn the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.

C. service territory, as mandated in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and in Executive Order 13423.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, any interested organization or entity, OTHER THAN WGS, which believes that it is capable of acquiring the necessary foundation knowledge and experience at its own expense, and which also believes that it is capable of actually performing this project at the high level of quality indispensable to DOT and within the short time-frames needed by DOT, shall e-mail-----to <a href="mailto:james.mowery@dot.gov">james.mowery@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:john.dunlap@dot.gov">john.dunlap@dot.gov</a>, not later than 11:59 PM Eastern Time on February 27, 2011-----a Statement of Qualifications attempting to prove that the interested entity is capable of performing this project as described.

Summary should include specific reconciling items and resolutions which may be useful or IA in planning future projects; and (d) List of addresses of all contact information. 7.0 SPECIAL PURCHASE ORDER REQUIREMENTSa. Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements: Performance of this purchase order requires Contractor personnel to have a Federal government-issued Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credential before being allowed unsupervised access to a DOI [facility].  The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) will be the requesting official, and will make arrangements as a DOI Access Card Sponsor for personal identity verification and DOI Access Card issuance.At least two weeks before start of purchase order performance, the Contractor must identify all Contractor and Subcontractor personnel who will require [physical and/or logical] access for performance of work under this purchase order. Physical Access means routine, unescorted or unmonitored access to non-public area of a Federally-controlled facility.  Logical Access means routine, unsupervised access to a Level 3 or 4 Federally controlled information system.  The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR/COTR in order to initiate screening and background investigations.  The following forms and inquiries, or their equivalent, will be used to initiate the credentialing process: (1) OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P; (2) OF 306; (3) National Criminal History Check (NCHC) (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to be done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the contractor); (4) Release to Obtain Credit Information; and (5) PIV card application (web-based).
Before starting work under this purchase order, a National Criminal History Check (NCHC) will be initiated to verify the identity of the individual applying for clearance and to determine the individual's suitability for the position.  If the NCHC adjudication is favorable, a DOI Access Card will be issued for that individual.  If the adjudication is unfavorable, the credentials will not be issued and the contractor must make other arrangements for performance of the work.  In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this purchase order, DOI shall have the right of final determination.
Contractor employees must give, and authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination.  Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials.  Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor must ensure they are available for such purchase order.  Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary.  In that case, the contractor must provide the COR/COTR with documentation that supports the individual's credentialed status. 
Contractor employees who have been successfully adjudicated will be issued DOI Access Cards, which must be activated at a USAccess Credentialing Center.  Those Contractor employees not located within a reasonable travel time of a USAccess Credentialing Center will be screened and issued alternate credentials, such as temporary access badges.   
During performance of the purchase order, the Contractor must keep the COR/COTR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes.  Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR/COTR and Issuing Office within 24 hours.  If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it must be coordinated through the COR/COTR.

_Registered in the CCR database_ means that_ 

(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and 

(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record _Active_. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process. 

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 

(g) 

(1) 

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, _doing business as_ name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day_s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

 Section I
  


I.1 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER--CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)  


     (a) Method of payment. 
          (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
          (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either- 
               (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
               (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
     (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
     (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. 
     (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
     (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
          (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for- 
               (i) Making a correct payment; 
               (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
     (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
     (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. The procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through January 2011 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars 2005-48. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 519120. <br /><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate on a sole source basis with the British Library in Boston Spa, United Kingdom (UK), for continuation of indexing services under the current purchase order for journals published in the UK for citation in MEDLINE/PubMed. The British Library has provided such services to NLM for more than 30 years, and possesses staff members that have been fully trained to perform MEDLINE indexing. Using their own copies of journals published in the UK, and using their own computer equipment and telecommunications system, British <br />Library-trained staff will analyze journal articles for subject content and apply <br />appropriate subject headings drawn from NLM's controlled thesaurus, MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), using the NLM's Web-based indexing system (to which NLM will provide access). The British staff members are trained in NLM MEDLINE indexing policy and have many years of satisfactory indexing performance from their staff. Use of this source would eliminate the need to train new indexers. Indexing will be performed following the policies and rules specified in NLM's MEDLINE Indexing Manual and technical memoranda. The journal articles are highly technical in nature, and require subject knowledge of the biomedical sciences in order to perform adequate subject analysis and indexing. The volume of indexing is anticipated to be approximately 23,000 journal articles per year. The period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about April 1, 2011 with options for two (2) successive one-year periods. All proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM. Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office by February 24, 2011 and must include pricing information and meet NLM's requirement. This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).<br /><br />
<p>NLM Synopsis No. NLM-11-069-UHP. EMAILS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTABLE. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional services required by NLM.

<p><br />BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a firm fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance): Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all of the contract requirements regarding meeting space, food and beverage, audiovisual equipment, and lodging. Quotations will be evaluated on the quality of the customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the facilities, as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space, the maintenance and upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, layout, atmosphere (size, windows, light, sound, obstructions, disruptive construction) design of available meeting space, and amenities. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as it relates to meeting space, lodging, and parking. (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quoters who can provide the required services on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e., 1st choice dates, 2nd choice dates, and 3rd choice dates. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the following geographical area with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters: San Diego, CA;Coronado, CA; La Jolla, CA; Mission Bay, CA; Del Mar, CA; Torrey Pines, CA; or Carlsbad, CA. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or other non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on meeting design/layout, quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference. In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate. Each quoter shall complete the Response Form, Attachment A, which includes the quoter's pricing quotation. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all three line items listed in this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for audio visual; sleeping room rates; all cost options for transportation; and facility parking rates. The EEOC is a tax exempt Federal agency, please do not include any sales tax in quotations for which the Federal Government is exempt.</p>
<p>Notice: The Government reserves the right to make a contract award without discussion with quoters (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the vendor's initial quote should contain the vendor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <BR><BR>FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY (Services must be performed by a manufacturer's authorized repair technician at Government's facility where the equipment is utilized using only Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) replacement parts & components). To be technically acceptable provide technically qualified technicians available for performing services (i.e. resumes, certificates and/or any other documentation). Only those quotes considered technically acceptable will be further evaluated for price.  <BR>FACTOR 2 - PRICE  <BR><BR>Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated based on their technical acceptability.  The award decision will be based on the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote. To be considered technically acceptable, the offeror shall submit a quote on services requested.  Award will be on an all or none basis; the offeror shall submit prices on all CLINs.  <BR><BR> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <BR>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision 52.212-2).<BR><BR>52.212-2 Addendum, includes the following to paragraph (a):     The Government will evaluate each quote strictly in accordance with its contents.  A quote that is unrealistic in terms of technical quality or price will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the contractual requirements.  Such quotes may be determined unacceptable.  Award will be made to the lowest-price, technically-acceptable offeror.  Award will be made to the offeror that presents the quote that possesses all of the following characteristics:  <BR>(1) meets the acceptability standards,<BR>(2) conforms to the solicitation,<BR>(3) determined acceptable to the Government,<BR>(4) is from a responsible (as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 9) offeror,<BR>and (5) has the lowest price of those offerors meeting the first four characteristics listed here.  <BR><BR>Except for communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification, the Government intends to evaluate quotes and award a contract without discussions.  Therefore, each initial offer shall contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  <BR><BR>TECHNICAL EVALUATION STANDARDS:<BR><BR>(1) Acceptable - A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.  <BR><BR>(2)  Unacceptable - A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk  and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal. (End of 52.212-2 Addendum); <BR><BR>52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items Alt I.

The full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this internet address: https://www.acquisition.gov/far; 52.211-15 Defense Priority and Allocation Requirements (APR 2008); 52.247-34 F.O.B. Destination (NOV 1991); 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (JAN 2011)(b)(4)(21-24)(26)(33-34)(37)(42) 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)<br />Closing date for receipt of quotations is 17 February 2011, 2 P.M. EST. Submit to USCG Aviation Logistics Center, SRR Product Line, Elizabeth City, NC, ATTN: Sheila G. Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />1. Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />b. Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />c. Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />d. Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />e. Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br /><br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Price: The total price will be the evaluated price.<br /><br />(a) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />EVALUATION APPROACH</p>
<p>1. An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.</p>
<p>2. The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.</p>
<p>3. Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals as deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.</p>
<p>4. The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.</p>
<p>5. The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation technical capability and past performance are approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit proposals that will be considered by the agency. Proposals must fully address all Technical Capabilities Factors and Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number. Proposals must be received no later than <br />17 FEB, 11:00 A.M. Local California time. Proposals received after the date and time specified will not be considered. Proposals may be submitted as an attachment to an e-mail addressed to: Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil .</p>

<p><br />OMBUDSMAN NOTICE</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

All vendors must receive approval from Maquet and Metronic for distributing their product line.  Please provide proof at time of RFQ submission.

2.	Question: Can you clarify what are the specific technical requirements you are looking for and on which each solicitation will be judged?
Answer:  Refer to the solicitation and all information is listed.

3.	Question: Can you provide information on projected volume's and the units of measure you expect shipments to come in.
Answer:  This is for direct patient care and exact quantities per order cannot be determined.  Per the solicitation each vendor needs to submit the min/max per one shipment.

5.	Question: Finally, when would the contact go into effect?

<DESC>Questions and Answers<br /><br />Q: PWS para 2.1 requires contractor support of all TDC systems covered under this contract. It further states that the contractor will provide help desk support and other equipment repair, failure diagnostics, etc services on a continuing basis. From these statements coupled with information discussed at the industry day it is assumed that there are to be several operational TDC systems located at the help desk location, kept in good working condition and serviceable, for use in supporting the above requirements as well as being available for shipment to the field should (when) the need arises. (See PWS para 3.1.2) This leads to several interrelated questions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. What are the nomenclatures of all the fielded TDC systems that are to be supported under this contract? Our knowledge of the equipment currently used by the Air Force includes many systems, old and newer, that can be deployed with an Air Force unit that may or may not be included for support by this contract. The inventory list included in attachment 1 provides some information but not enough to accurately define the various end item systems. So the question is what are the nomenclatures' of the various SATCOM (LMST), Integrated Communications Access Packages (ICAP), and Network Management System/Base Information Protection (NMS/BIP) systems supported by this contract?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A: During the industry day conversations it was stated that we wanted folks that know the TDC systems that are currently deployed. There are not any operational TDC systems located at the help desk. Also stated during industry day was that the only systems currently at the warehouse was an Avaya used for the ICAP system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Are there various OEM's of these end item systems? i.e., did more than one company supply each of the LSMT, ICAP or NMS/BIP systems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A: I'm not sure how this will help. <br />What is expected is that the contractor will be responsible to maintain all the TDC equipment housed by the current contractor. Failed equipment is to be sent out for repair with replacement parts from maintained TDC equipment sent out to the field as required. There will be an Avaya system used for ICAP troubleshooting provided identified as GFE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Are there various OEM's of these end item systems? i.e., did more than one company supply each of the LSMT, ICAP or NMS/BIP systems?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A: Yes<br /><br />Q: Attachment (1) does not give dimensions and weight of items. This makes warehouse arrangement/estimate for actual storage space difficult. How much of the 25000 square feet is storage and how much is administrative?<br />A: A current facility structure has been added as one of the attachments in FBO.</p>
<p>Q: GFM does not include shelving, forklift, pallet jacks, or ladders/pickers. So do we assume that we price to provide such items along with the labor needed to move material from the incumbent's shelving/cabinets during transition if he will not sell those items, now in use at the warehouse, for industry standard price?<br />A: Bidders need to price shelving, forklift, pallet jack, ladders etc. All equipment that contractor feels they would need to manage a warehouse. This equipment will become the property of the Air Force. Transportation costs for equipment shipped form current warehouse will be paid via the current contract. Once equipment arrives at new location it will be the awardees responsibility to unpack and maintain.<br /><br />Q: If we decide to relocate warehouse during the transition period, to a lower cost site, who would pay for the shipping of the GFM/GFE to new site?<br />A: As was stated at Industry day, the relocation of items from current warehouse to a new location if required will be borne by the current contract holder. GDIT (Current contractor) will be required to package and ship equipment to awardees new location. Once equipment arrives at awardees site it will be the awardees responsibility to unpack, shelve and maintain equipment.<br /><br />Q: Is the incumbent contractor obligated under the existing contract to cooperate with us during the transition period as referenced in paragraph 7.1 of the PWS dated 24 Jan 2011? <br />A: No, the only communication between incumbent and awardee will be through the government.<br /><br />Q: Is the material that is listed on the equipment list that says awaiting DRMO going to be disposed of before contract award or will it be included with the inventory transfer?</p>
<p>A: There may be some equipment that comes from the incumbent that must be sent to DRMO depending on when it arrives to the depot.</p>
<p>Q: Do any of the equipment/spares need to be certified as hazardous material for shipment or storage?</p>
<p>A: The only possible hazardous piece of equipment would be the Traveling Wave Tube Assembly (TWTA). The TWTA resides inside various High Power Amplifiers (HPA). The part number of the HPA itself, along with any TWTA may vary, as can the manufacturers of both/either tubes or amplifiers. The TWTA may be considered hazardous if crushed. USAF field units send suspected faulty HPAs to the depot for repairs. The depot then sends the HPAs to various OEMs for repair actions. If the HPA is identified as being beyond economical repair, then we have the OEM properly dispose of the TWTA through HAZMAT-certified organizations and the Government pays for the disposal. Because the TWTA is sealed and the seal is never broken while in use or shipping, the current depot has not encountered any regulations or directives indicating that there is a need for special handling and it is not considered a shipping or storage hazard.</p>
<p>HPAs currently at the Dept are Xicom brand and have one of the following part numbers:</p>
<p>305-0125-010, 305-0125-006, 305-0125-010E, 305-0125-006E, 305-0203-111, 305-0203-112, 305-0203-113, 305-0203-114, 305-0224-008, 305-0224-010, <br />305-0224-012, 305-0224-013, 305-0345-029, 305-0345-012</p>
<p>Q: Is there any list for the equipment/spares that gives weights and dimensions?</p>
<p>A: Government does not possess any list.</p>
<p>Q: Is IMDS/REMIS training to be provided on site at the warehouse?</p>
<p>A: If training is not held at the awardees facility, there is a travel CLIN included in the solicitation that will be utilized.</p>
<p>Q: What is the required delivery timeline for material to the fleet?</p>
<p>A: The QAP will direct the timeline for delivery to the field.</p>
<p>Q: Is government transportation provided for material going to forward deployed sites or is it up to the contractor to get the material there by a commercial sources?</p>
<p>A: Transportation is a Cost Reimbursement No Fee CLIN, however Mil Air may also be required for shipping.</p>
<p>Q: What does quarantine in the location field of the equipment list designate?</p>
<p>A: Quarantine is a warehouse location on the current contract.</p>
<p>Q: Can we visit the warehouse now in use for TDC support?<br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: CDRL 0002 asks for firm fixed pricing on items from 12 venders. Without historical data as to "Should Cost", how are we to determine that the prime venders are providing the best pricing for the government?<br />A: The Government knows the costs from historical and Contractor's are allowed to research different vendors for the best price.<br /><br />Q: Would it be possible to meet face to face with you at Hill AFB to clarify issues.<br />A: In an effort to avoid favoritism, the Government will not meet with any Contractors.<br /><br />Q: We understand that there is not a separate CLIN for the warehouse yet the warehouse facility is referenced in PWS sections 3.2.1, 3.3.(c) and 3.4. Will the Government provide the warehouse facility? If not, what CLIN does the Government want the contractor to account for these costs in the cost volume?</p>
<p>A: The warehouse facility that is referenced in PWS section 3.2.1 states the square footage of the current contract warehouse. PWS Section 3.3 (c) mentions enhancements of materials required for TDC equipment. Section 3.4 states security procedures for any facility that holds TDC equipment. The Government maintains that the contractor will sustain all GOTS equipment house via current contract for the purpose of repair/replacement to End users as required by the Government.</p>
<p>Q: Is the Government going to provide the succeeding contractor with the database used by the incumbent for tracking program assets?</p>
<p>A: Any Government owned database used in conjunction with the current TDC warehouse/helpdesk will be provided by the awardee.</p>
<p>Q: The worksheet entitled Attachment 1 includes all spares to be priced at the individual unit price. There are some 6,300 items in this spreadsheet. In order to price these items, the Government must provide us with the following data for all items listed: Part Number, NSN, nomenclature, most recent price data on all items, and the required threshold for spares.</p>
<p>A: As these are mostly COTS items, there are no NSN numbers. Contractor needs to review listing as Attachment 1 consists of less than 750 items that provides known part numbers.</p>

These items are currently produced in support of ongoing Total Package Fielding and other distributions of DAGR systems. As requirements change, accessories items may be deleted or added.

Each BPA awarded will include only those accessory items for which the awardee's proposal was deemed technically acceptable.

The government will randomly select one test exhibit for each item proposed from the sample proposal test lot as provided. The test exhibit will be tested in accordance with the item specification.

<DESC><br />Behavioral and Serological Survey for HIV and Syphilis <br />Among Long Distance Transportation Workers in Cunene and Luanda, Angola
<p>Statement of Objectives</p>
<p>I. Introduction.</p>
<p>A contract for a behavioral and serologic surveillance study is needed to assist the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Government of the Republic of Angola through the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA in their collaborative efforts to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Angola.</p>
<p>II. Background.</p>
<p>Through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is building the capacity of resource-constrained nations to strategically collect and use information for program accountability and improvement. To better understand the relationships among populations, HIV prevalence, and existing services, CDC builds in-country capacity to design, implement, and evaluate HIV/AIDS-related surveillance systems and surveys; assists and trains countries on how to analyze, disseminate, and use HIV/AIDS data for improved planning and program implementation. <br />Considering the well reported importance of monitoring the epidemics and the behavior of most at risk populations (MARPs) for HIV, the Instituto Nacional de Luta contra a SIDA (INLS) has requested assistance in conducting behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) in Angola with MARPs. Based on the results of a qualitative assessment with most at risk populations in the provinces of Luanda and Cunene, it was recommended that a BSS be conducted with long distance truck drivers in both Luanda and Cunene provinces. Although no serological data is available for truck drivers in Angola, several studies have identified them as a vulnerable population for acquiring and transmitting STI (sexually transmitted infections), including HIV, in different locations throughout the world. HIV risk in this population is driven by the mobile nature of their work, which makes them move away from protective social networks, including family and broader communities, and may result in greater exposure to risky behaviors while traveling (Lippman et al., 2007). Following Angola's civil war, the borders of neighboring countries opened, allowing greater mobility to and from neighbor countries with generalized HIV epidemics. As a result, long distance truck drivers have become an important population for acquiring and transmitting STI/HIV. <br />III. Scope.</p>
<p>In the performance of this task, the contractor shall conduct a behavioral and serologic surveillance (BSS) study among long distance truck drivers and their assistants in Luanda and Cunene provinces of Angola. The contractor will also train INLS representatives in the process.</p>
<p>The objectives of the survey are to: <br />1) Examine attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions of risk related to HIV and STD among the target population; <br />2) To explore the relationship among socio-demographic, behavioral and contextual factors and HIV and syphilis prevalence;<br />3) Estimate HIV and syphilis prevalence in the study population; and <br />4) Develop capacity within the Ministry of Health to implement subsequent BSS surveys <br />among most at risk populations for HIV. <br />IV. Project Summary.</p>
<p>The BSS will include an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire along with biological testing for syphilis and HIV. This effort requires the contractor to:</p>
<p>&bull; Determine the best methodology for conducting the study an obtain concurrence of CDC.<br />&bull; Develop the study protocol for approval by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards of the host government, CDC, and the contractor;<br />&bull; Develop a quality control plan to ensure that the requirements of the contract are met and adherence to the approved protocol as well as all local and U.S. human subjects protection requirements;</p>
<p>&bull; Implement the survey according to the protocol;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage and analyze the data;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop recommendations for HIV/AIDS program planning based on those results;</p>
<p>&bull; Disseminate the study results and recommendations;</p>
<p>&bull; Train INLS staff in the survey methodology;</p>
<p>&bull; Support the Technical Advisory Committee led by the INLS; and</p>
<p>&bull; Collaborate with stakeholders.</p>
<p>V. Performance Period.</p>
<p>Start Date: Date of the Award</p>
<p>End Date: 12 months from date of CDC CGH ADS approval</p>

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE</p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce (DOC) that is focused on the condition of the oceans and the atmosphere. The NOAA mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our nation's economic, social and environmental needs. As a supplier of environmental information products, NOAA provides the nation with information that pertains to the state of the oceans and the atmosphere. This is clearly manifest in the production of weather warnings and forecasts through the National Weather Service, but NOAA's information products extend to climate, ecosystems and commerce as well. NOAA serves as the steward of national coastal and marine environments. In coordination with federal, state, local, tribal and international authorities, NOAA manages the use of these environments, regulating fisheries and marine sanctuaries as well as protecting threatened and endangered marine species.</p>
<p>NOAA is a trusted source of accurate and objective scientific information in four particular areas of national and global importance which constitute its long-term mission critical and strategic goals:<br />&bull; Ecosystems: Ensure the sustainable use of resources and balance competing uses of coastal and marine ecosystems, recognizing both their human and natural components. <br />&bull; Climate: Understand changes in climate, including the El Ni&ntilde;o phenomenon, to ensure that we can plan and respond properly. <br />&bull; Weather &amp; Water: Provide data and forecasts for weather and water cycle events, including storms, droughts and floods. <br />&bull; Commerce &amp; Transportation: Provide weather, climate, and ecosystem information to make sure individual and commercial transportation is safe, efficient and environmentally sound.</p>
<p>To assist it in framing its long-term strategic course in many complex and interrelated scientific and technical topics, NOAA requires studies to be done with a high level of credibility, impartiality, and objectivity. This requires an understanding of the current state of science as well as an intimate knowledge of newly emerging scientific and technical methodologies to support recommendations for future directions NOAA should take into consideration while laying out its strategic plan to meet its mission goals. Possible areas to be investigated through studies, but are not limited to, the following areas of interest:<br />&bull; Integrated Observing and Data Management System<br />&bull; Assessments and Forecasts of Coastal and Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Scenario Development to Support Specific Management Actions and Decisions<br />&bull; Exploring Unknown and Little Known Areas of Earth's Oceans<br />&bull; Capacity Building and Effective Knowledge Transfer<br />&bull; Integrated Global Observation and Data System<br />&bull; Documenting and Understanding Changes in Climate Forcings and Feedbacks<br />&bull; Improving Climate Predictions and Projections<br />&bull; Understanding Impacts of Climate Variability and Change on Marine Ecosystems<br />&bull; Enhancing NOAA's Operational Decision Support Tools<br />&bull; Improving Weather Forecasts and Warnings<br />&bull; Water Resources Forecasting<br />&bull; Providing Information to Air Quality Decision Makers and Establishing and Improving a National Air Quality Forecast Capability<br />&bull; Improving Understanding and Forecast Capability in Coasts, Estuaries, and Oceans<br />&bull; Reduced Risks to Life, Health, and Property<br />&bull; Issues that Slow or Stop Movement of Goods<br />&bull; Reduced Risks and Adverse Environmental Impacts<br />&bull; Security</p>
<p>Based upon a thorough review of both the government's requirements and market research conducted under the Sources Sought Notice for this solicitation, NOAA intends on soliciting and negotiating a sole source indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract with the National Academy of Sciences (Academy) for independent scientific, technical, and policy guidance services from scientists and others in a variety of environmental and public policy issues to provide independent scientific advice which shall result in compilation of written reports. The proposed period of performance is for a period of&nbsp;five (5)&nbsp;years [CORRECTION OF NUMBER OF YEARS DUE TO A TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR] tentatively starting March 30, 2011. The total value of this effort is estimated to be no more than $9.9 Million.</p>
<p>The Academy performs a unique public service. It brings together leaders from academia, industry, government, and other sectors to address critical national issues and provide cogent, unbiased, and scientifically informed advice to the U.S. Government and its citizens. To a degree unmatched elsewhere, these institutions elicit the participation of virtually any scientist whom it invites to serve. The credibility of the resulting reports is maximized by the recognized impartiality of the institutions which manufacture no product, possess no funds to disburse, have no power of decision over the scientific establishment and have no executive or regulatory authority. Thus, neither it nor its transient working committees which may be given immediate responsibility for a particular study or inquiry can be fairly accused of a vested interest in the outcome of deliberations.</p>
<p>Moreover, because of the type of studies to be completed and their overall significance on public policy, NOAA has determined after reviewing all market research capability statements submitted in response to the Sources Sought Notice that the Academy is the only source that can provide this degree of independent advice of unparalleled objectivity of the highest quality that provides an inherent degree of acceptability. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is Section 303(c)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), and is implemented by FAR 6.301-1, which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources that believe they have the necessary expertise and capacity to provide these studies may submit proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency if received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the posting date. Responses may be forwarded electronically to Joan Clarkston at joan.e.clarkston@noaa.gov or fax at (816)274-6966. The response shall be no more than twenty (20) single-sided pages in length and shall address the following topics:<br />&bull; Organization's Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, and Point of Contact Information<br />&bull; Brief summary describing your organization and purpose. If you are an educational institution, list any specific areas of study (e.g. - degree programs, emphasis programs).<br />&bull; Provide a list of experience and studies in topics that are similar to the above. Discuss how scientific experts and qualified scientists are selected to conduct these studies. Discuss how you would incorporate a wide range of views to give a spectrum of scientific thought in a subject area. If studies were conducted on behalf of the government, list department and agency along with a point of contact name, number, and email address.<br />&bull; List experience/education/certifications of any key personnel relevant to the studies above completed in the past five (5) years. Copies of resumes and a list of relevant papers published should be included. The list should provide at a minimum, the author, name of the study, publication, and date with a synopsis of the study.<br />&bull; Credibility, impartiality, and objectivity of the study by your institution. Since these reports impact environmental and agency policy, your organization should discuss how you will ensure credibility, impartiality, and objectivity in any studies that could be conducted by your organization. In order to maintain this credibility, impartiality, and objectivity, indicate any financial interests that might relate to the studies listed above and provide an explanation of how you would mitigate any potential risk associated with those financial interests. <br />&bull; Include your business size classification (e.g. large business, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, SDB, SDVOSB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.)</p>

Question:	Could you please tell me if there is a limit on the number of example projects allowed in the SF330 form?
Answer:	There is no limit other than what is stated in the Pre-solicitation announcement, i.e, Part I Contract-Specific Qualifications is limited to 50 pages.
  Double sided pages shall be counted as two pages.  There is no limit on Part II General Qualifications. 
Question:	It is our understanding that a 50-page limit for Part I would actually allow for 100 pages of content if using both the front and back of each page.  Is this a fair assessment and if we do use both sides of all 50 pages will you allow all of them to be included in the evaluation process?
Answer:	Pursuant to the Pre-solicitation announcement, double sided pages shall be counted as two pages. 
Question:	We are assembling our team for the above solicitation and wonder if it would be preferable to NAVFAC if we were to form a JV with our key local consultant or if a teaming arrangement or even a prime-sub relationship would suffice?
Answer:	Team structure is the sole business decision of the firm proposing.
 
Question:	The preponderance of the projects are electrical mechanical in the scope of services statement, but building related work seems to be what is important in the Corporate Experience Section.  Can you validate we should focus on the scope of individual task orders description.  We want our submittal to be as precise as possible.
Answer:	The majority of the tasks described in the scope of individual task orders do apply to buildings (new design, major renovation, energy upgrades, etc.).   However, a small percentage of task orders awarded under this contract may be for facilities other than buildings, i.e., dry docks and utilities.

Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC)

This procurement will result in the award of up to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Design-Build contracts to successful Hubzone contractors.  The work will primarily consist of Design-Build, Construction Contracts for general building type projects (new construction and renovation) roofing, demolition, repair of facilities and infrastructure including but not limited to: 1) barracks and personnel housing facilities, 2) administrative facilities, 3) warehouses and supply facilities, 4) medical and dental facilities; 5) abatement and handling of hazardous/regulated materials (including but not limited to asbestos, lead paint and PCBs); 6) the civil, sanitary, stormwater, mechanical and electrical systems  for the Area of Responsibility(AOR) of PWD Midsouth Contracting Office, NSA Mid-South, Millington, TN.
  This Area is limited to: Naval Support Activity Mid-South, Millington, TN.  

The estimated value for all contracts is $9 million.  Each contract will be for one base year and two option years.  The anticipated range for each task order is between $650,000 and $3,000,000.  This range is for information only and may vary.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two Phase Design-Build Request for Proposal procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.   

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of up to 6 offerors (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Safety, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.
  Phase I design-build factors relate to the three year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including new construction, roofing, demolition, routine renovation and repair of facilities and infrastructure, not just the seed project to be identified in Phase II RFP.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed to Phase II.  

In Phase II, the selected Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals for the seed project.  Offerors who fail to submit their Phase II technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the seed project, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality requirements of construction.
  Price proposals may include total price evaluation or evaluation of scope/design options, within the Governments published budget for award. The best value offeror will receive a contract for the seed project and the best value offerors will receive minimum guarantees. Up to four IDIQ design-build contracts will be awarded for a maximum three years term.  If there is more than one seed project, the offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.
  The Size Standard is $33.5M.
    
After award of the initial contracts, the successful offerors will compete for task orders based on either Best Value to the Government or Lowest Price Technically Acceptable.  Proposers will be required to submit a bid bond for the seed project and for each task order.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.
  The task order statements of work may be written based on a Government/Contractor Team cooperative scoping of the work. Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may require incorporation of sustainable design features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.
  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one or more of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components.</p>
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5.

<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to award the purchase of "two (2) Lab QMD-PrePress QC-2005 quality measuring devices to support PhotoOffset prepress" to KBA-Giori. The purchase will be made under FAR part 13.
<p>This acquisition will be made under a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) as there is only one responsible source. The JOFOC is per FAR part 6.302-1.</p>
<p>This is a sole source acquisition because LabQMD Prepress is manufactured exclusively for KBA Giori by Quality Engineering. The BEP is currently using a QMD to capture, and analyze images in Engraving/Platemaking, Printing, Quality Assurance and other departments. The instrument in use is not capable of capturing images, and measuring images on the Offset printing Plates. A demonstration of the LAB QMD Prepress has proven capability to do so. Acquiring the upgraded LabQMD Prepress, and using it in conjunction with the earlier generation QMD, will give BEP much needed capability of assuring matching banknotes of each plant, as well as increasing the overall quality of BEP produced banknotes. The software used with the LabQMD Prepress is proprietary. <br />The new unit will work in conjunction with the earlier generation, and has the ability to interchange parts, and interface software use. BEP already has the knowledge to successfully use the earlier generation device, and needed training will be minimal.</p>
<p>If BEP were to find, and acquire a unit that can accomplish what the LabQMD can, there will be shortcomings. The BEP will not have the interchangeability with earlier model, and the capability of measuring line width on the offset printing plates accurately prior to seeing the printed image. Variations noticed at press, are too late, and too costly.</p>
<p>This requirement does not result from of lack of planning or expiration of funds. This requirement is the result of a defined need to upgrade equipment, specifically the QMD inspection equipment to meet the needs of the BEP as its upgrades and compliments the equipment used in the manufacturing of U.S. currency.</p>
<p>Contact Mark Anderson, Contract Specialist, at 202-874-6255 or Mark.Anderson@bep.gov with any questions regarding this notice.</p>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition
1.	Contracting Activity :  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach VA Medical Center, Acquisition Service Center 7, Service Team 3.  
The Prosthetics Service at the Tampa VAMC has submitted 2237 # 673-11-2-910-2159, as an Emergency priority, to be processed by ASC 7 (Station 548) for the procurement of Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Services. Estimated cost: $88,000.00.
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 

This action is for a sole source urgent and compelling requirement to provide DME services for patients of the James Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa, Florida and the surrounding area CBOC's.  Veterans Medical Supply, Inc. has been providing the necessary services.  

There was not a lack of advanced planning for this requirement.  Contract VA248-P-1419 was competitively awarded on 06/24/2010 to provide DME services.  This contract was terminated for convenience on 01/14/2011 as a result of a protest filed by an unsuccessful offeror.  These services are still needed and this temporary bridge contract is required to avoid a break in services while ASC 8 (Station 673) is currently working on getting a new competitive contract in place.
3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 
The requirement is for the storage, delivery/install, and pick-up of VA owned Durable Medical Equipment.  
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 
(   ) 	(1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(X)     (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
(   )      (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
(   )      (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
(   )     (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
(   )     (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
(   )     (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7






  	5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use  of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): 
Veterans Medical Supply currently has an entire inventory of VA-Owned DME equipment.  Award to another vendor for this bridge contract would cause an unacceptable delay in services.  Other capable vendors are encouraged to compete in the long-term DME contract currently being processed by ASC 8 (Station 673).
6.Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as  deemed  practicable:
This required action is for a bridge contract to provide services while a long-term contract is put in place.  Other vendors capable of providing the required services are encouraged to compete in the long-term DME contract currently being processed.  
7.Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and  Reasonable:
Anticipated costs for this temporary bridge contract are considered fair and reasonable as they are the very same prices from the competitively awarded DME contract VA248-P-1419 that was terminated for convenience on 01/14/2011. 
8.Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market  Research Was Not Conducted:
This required action is for a bridge contract to provide services while a long-term contract is put in place.  Other vendors capable of providing the required services are encouraged to compete in the long-term DME contract currently being processed.  
     9.Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition: 
 N/A
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
N/A
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to  Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   

A follow-on competitive acquisition is currently being processed.
