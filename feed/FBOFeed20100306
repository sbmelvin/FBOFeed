<DESC>THE SCOPE OF SERVICE IS REVISED AS FOLLOWS:REVISED SCOPE OF SERVICE:  Architect or architect/engineer firm capable of preparing all design documentation including, but not limited to, advance planning and design of the relocation of an existing Sterile Processing and Distribution (SPD) Department at the Harry S Truman Veterans Memorial Hospital (HSTMVH) in Columbia MO.  Prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines be members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields:  Systems Redesign Consultant, Architect; Medical Planners; Structural, Mechanical, Geo-technical, Communication, Plumbing, and Electrical Engineers; Radiation Physicist; Lean Consultant; Interior Designers; and Cost Estimators with experience in the programming, planning and design of an Sterile Processing and Distribution Department.  The project will relocate the SPD Department from its current location in the basement of the hospital building to its new location in an unfinished space of the Operating Suite (OR) addition currently being constructed on the west side of the hospital building.  The space to be located by the new SPD department is approximately 14,000 square feet with a concrete floor and exterior walls. The design shall include a system redesign process intended to review the existing SPD operation noting inefficiencies and inadequacies to incorporate improvements in the new space design. The result of the systems redesign process is to have a new work center design that yields the most effective use of space and equipment to achieve the departmental operational requirements. The project will include construction of walls, doors, ceilings, electrical power and lighting, HVAC systems, plumbing systems, and floor coverings. Construction will include the installation of new sterilizers and all associated equipment and all necessary utilities including phone and data site prep.
