GETTING STARTED GUIDE FOR VENDORS
ON
HOW TO LOG INTO THE VA ECMS VENDOR PORTAL

________________________________________



	



VA eCMS Vendor Portal (the production version): https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov




The VA Electronic Contract Management System (VA eCMS) is a comprehensive tool used by the VA Acquisition staff to create and manage VA acquisitions.  VA eCMS is used to manage the full acquisition lifecycle, including the announcement of solicitations to vendors and the receipt of vendor responses.  There are three announcement mechanisms in VA eCMS.  VA Acquisition staff will continue to post announcements for full and open competition to FedBizOpps which will now also be available for review, download, and response by vendors via the Vendor Portal.  Solicitations for federal supply schedule acquisitions may be posted to e-Buy and will not be available for review via the Vendor Portal. Finally, limited competition acquisitions may be announced directly on the Vendor Portal for review, download and response by invited vendors.  A link to the VA Forecast of Contracting Opportunites (FCO) reports is available on the Vendor Portal home page.  

This guide provides vendors with information on how to obtain a vendor account, how to log into the Vendor Portal and how to rest the password.  There are also instructions on how to edit a vendor  user's profile once logged in and instructions how to search FCO reports.  

You can find additional documentation in the Help Library of the the Vendor Portal developed to assist vendors with using the Vendor Portal (you need to be logged into the Vendor Portal to access this documentation).  For additional help, you can:

 	Access the New User Help Documents link on the Login Page 
 	Access the   tab after logging into the Vendor Portal

 	Contact the VA Acquisition Systems Helpdesk via email at VA.Acquisition.Systems@va.gov or via phone at (877) 634-3739

Before you can view solicitations on the Vendor Portal you must first register for an account.  You can register for an account by going directly to the vendor portal.  On the homepage of the vendor portal, there is a link to "Request a User Account" to access the Vendor Portal Self-Registration Utility.  This utility will walk you through a few screens so that you can register for an account on the Vendor Portal.   

Step 1:		
 	Click on the link below to access the eCMS Vendor Portal:
https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov

 	If you do not have an account, you can request one by clicking on the Request a User Account link at the bottom of the Vendor Portal Login section on the upper left hand corner of the Vendor Portal homepage, 



Step 2:		 	Enter your 9 digit vendor DUNS number as listed in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and click Next. 

 
Step 3:		 	Complete the New User Registration form.  If you are requesting an administrative account, you will need to check the box on the bottom of the page.  If you are the first user to request an account for your vendor, you must be an administrator.  Click Next to proceed.  


NOTE: There are two types of Vendor User accounts:

o	Standard User Accounts - most users will have standard user accounts, which allow for viewing and responding to solicitations.  Standard user accounts have no administrative privileges.

o	Administrative Accounts - users with Administrative Accounts can view and respond to solicitations and have permission to setup and edit Standard User accounts for users in their respective company who need to access the eCMS Vendor Portal. Typically each company will have only one Administrative Account.  If you are requesting an Administrator Account, be sure to check the box in the selection field.

If you can't determine who the eCMS Administrator is at your company, feel free to contact the VA Acquisition Systems Helpdesk via email at VA.Acquisition.Systems@va.gov or via phone at (877) 634-3739.

Step 4:		 	Enter an appropriate Login ID, enter and confirm Password, and click Next.

Upon changing the password, the Vendor Portal will send you an email message stating: "You have successfully reset your password.  If you did not request a password reset, contact the VAAS Helpdesk."
 
  Congratulations!  You have successfully reset your password.
 
As a user of the VA eCMS Vendor Portal, you have the ability to update certain information in your user account profile.  It is suggested that you access your account profile to confirm that the email address is correct, as this is the address to which notifications about solicitations will be sent.

Step 1:		 	Log In to the VA eCMS Vendor Portal https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov

 	Click on the   tab to view and edit your account profile.



Step 2:		 	Update any information as appropriate.  You can also update your password and security questions on this page.  NOTE: The red asterisks denote required fields.

 	Click on Save to save any changes or back out of the user profile screen by hitting the back button on your internet browser to close  without saving changes.




NOTE: Be sure to confirm your email address.  VA eCMS will use the email address in your account profile to send notifications of solicitations to which your company has been invited to respond.  


  Congratulations!  You have successfully updated your Vendor Portal user profile.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, El Paso VA Health Center, El Paso, TX, intends to solicit proposal from contractors in the metropolitan El Paso, TX area of responsibility (AOR) to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program. The VA anticipates issuing a solicitation for this requirement on or about December 14, 2012, with a closing date for proposals on or about January 14, 2013. The solicitation will be available for download from http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors will be responsible for downloading copies of solicitation (and any subsequent amendments) from that website, and no hard copies will be made available.  The solicitation will provide full information to contractors about the proposal submission process.  Prospective offerors are encouraged to register their interest in the solicitation on the FBO website so that they are notified of the issuance of the solicitation and any amendments.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services.  The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment as those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about March 1, 2013. Contracts will have a base term of one year, with options for four additional one-year terms exercisable in the discretion of the VA. 

The government will use a best value source selection method under Part 13 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and anticipates making multiple awards of fixed price, indefinite delivery, and indefinite quantity contracts for this requirement.

NAICS Code is 624229 and the solicitation will be issued for full and open competition. All responsible sources may submit proposals which shall be considered by the Agency.  To be eligible for award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration data base at www.ccr.gov. Registration is free and potential offerors are encouraged to visit that CCR website and register as soon as possible to avoid delays should they be selected for a contract award. Questions concerning this announcement should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Robert S. Miller, using the e-mail link provided at robert.miller15@va.gov.

<SUBJECT>Powering Agriculture: An Energy Grand Challenge for Development
<SOLNBR>SOL-OAA-13-000017
<CONTACT>Claudia O. Koziol, Contracting Officer, Email PoweringAg@usaid.gov
<DESC><br /> Dear Interested Parties:
<p>The purpose of this notice is to announce that United States Government, represented by the Agency for International Development (USAID), Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment (E3) will be seeking proposals from industry and other interested parties around the world on the attached program initiative outlined below.</p>
<p>Issuance of this Notice does not constitute a binding commitment on the part of the Government to issue a Solicitation, nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission. Thank you for your consideration of this USAID initiative. We look forward to your organization's participation.</p>
<p>Powering Agriculture: An Energy Grand Challenge for Development</p>
<p><br />1. Objective</p>
<p>The objective of the Powering Agriculture: An Energy Grand Challenge for Development initiative is to improve agricultural productivity and value by increasing access to clean energy solutions to those along the agricultural value chain that suffer from no, or poor quality, grid power in developing countries. The program aims to foster innovative clean energy technologies and business models and catalyze private sector investment to enhance access to the clean energy inputs required for the agricultural value chain while simultaneously mitigating CO2 emissions from agricultural intensification. Furthermore, the energy/agriculture nexus provides an excellent opportunity for economic empowerment of women and gender sensitive approaches and all applicants will be required to address gender impacts of proposed programs. <br /><br />2. Areas of Interest</p>
<p>The Grand Challenge for Development model reflects an understanding that there is seldom just one way to solve complex development problems. In this regard, this CFP is designed to attract a diverse range of market-driven approaches to accelerate the design and deployment of clean energy solutions for farmers and agribusinesses.</p>
<p>The specific clean energy needs of farmers and related agribusinesses vary widely among different geographic regions. Countries differ significantly with respect to their natural resources, existing infrastructure, trade relations, energy policies, income levels, and maturity of clean energy markets. For these reasons, PAEGC is designed to support a wide range of activities that build on Applicants' individual strengths and the particular market environments in which they operate/plan to operate.</p>
<p>It is expected that proposals received through this solicitation will respond to one, two, or all three of the following areas of need - "Clean Energy Demand Generation," "Clean Energy Technology Innovation," and "Clean Energy Business Model Development."</p>
<p>Technology and Business Model Innovation <br />The partners anticipate that individual awards between $300,000 and $1,500,000 will be available for the following activities:</p>
<p>&bull;	Clean Energy Demand Generation.  PAEGC supports efforts to design affordable, scalable approaches to increasing farmers' and agribusinesses' demand for clean energy technologies that increase their productivity and profitability.  PAEGC financial support may be used for designing and piloting innovative demand generating activities, social marketing, and behavior change strategies to overcome the risk aversion associated with applying new technologies to long-standing agricultural practices.</p>
<p>&bull;	Clean Energy Technology Innovation. PAEGC support is available for development and/or adaptation of affordable technologies focused on clean energy generation, storage, and more efficient end-use within the agriculture sectors of developing countries that have potential for achieving commercial scale. This support may be for new technologies that are still in the incubation/demonstration stage, and/or existing technologies that are modified to respond to the demands of a specific target market. Successful Applicants will be able to clearly articulate the nature of the technology, its strengths and weaknesses over current/alternative practices, as well as opportunities and barriers to its commercial deployment within the identified target markets.</p>
<p>&bull;	Clean Energy Business Model Development. It is not only weak demand and technology constraints that hinder the adoption of clean energy solutions. PAEGC is also looking for innovative business solutions that make clean energy technology affordable and accessible to farmers and agribusinesses.  PAEGC support may be used to develop and test, for example, new service delivery options; payment arrangements; financing; marketing techniques for energy service businesses that would improve their financial sustainability.</p>
<p>3. What Will Not Be Funded</p>
<p>It is important for Applicants to note that there are certain types of activities that are not eligible for funding through this PAEGC solicitation. These include:<br />&bull;	Activities focused on improving energy access without an identified benefit to the agriculture sector, or agricultural projects without a clean energy component;<br />&bull;	Project ideas that are managed from or include activities to be implemented in ineligible countries;<br />&bull;	Approaches that reinforce harmful gender norms;<br />&bull;	Activities focused on research and development for a product without a clearly defined market demand or credible commercialization prospects;<br />&bull;	One-off renewable energy installations or pilot projects to support proven technologies for proven applications - unless they include an innovative component(s) that clearly outline realistic potential for replication and/or ability to achieve commercial scale; <br />&bull;	Projects that are based solely on fossil fuel-based generation technologies. Please note: Hybrid technologies that couple fossil fuel-based power generation with clean energy generation are acceptable;<br />&bull;	Projects focused on increasing utilization of mechanized agriculture utilizing fossil fuel based technologies, e.g., tractors;<br />&bull;	Projects that jeopardize the resiliency of agricultural practices or supply chains; and <br />&bull;	While it is understood that policy and trade reforms are often critical for technology development/deployment and for increasing energy access, such issues are better addressed through more conventional international development programs and/or bi-/multi-lateral negotiations. Thus, proposed remedial interventions of this nature will not be eligible for funding.</p>

<p><br />Synopsis:</p>
<p>Afghanistan C-208 Airdrop Program Request for Information (RFI) Synopsis. This synopsis is a RFI only. This is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation is being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this RFI Notice is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government. The information obtained from industry's response to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. In the following RFI Synopsis, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Wright-Patterson AFB is contemplating a single award Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. Period of Performance will be for two (2) to three (3) years.</p>
<p>The below listed paragraphs and technical requirements describe an acquisition strategy for an anticipated air drop program for the C-208B aircraft in Afghanistan. The contractor is to respond to the best of his ability with the qualifications of the contractor team to perform this program and answer all questions stated.</p>
<p>Government Furnished Property The government will provide two (2) Cessna Caravan C-208B aircraft equipped with cargo hauling production options (plywood floor, cargo barricade, nets and tie down straps) for the air drop program. The two aircraft will be ferried from Shindand, Afghanistan by the contractor.</p>
<p>Aircraft Modification Facility The contractor must have previous experience modifying a C-208 aircraft for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Supplemental Type Certification (STC) approved modifications. The contractor must have a Designated Engineering Representative (DER) and FAA certified technicians on staff. All modification work must follow FAA production line procedures.</p>
<p>Q1: Describe past modifications that the facility has performed on C-208 aircraft. <br />Q2: Describe the capabilities of the modification facility to comply with FAA certified modification work. <br />Q3: Is the facility ISO 9001 certified?</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Flight Test Aircraft Modifications The contractor is required to develop a STC package and receive approval for certification from the FAA for the following aircraft modification requirements, to be installed on two aircraft to support the flight test:</p>
<p>1. Roll-up door The roll up door installs inside the cargo door frame without obstructing the use of the cargo door. When the roll-up door is not in use it is to be locked in the full up position to allow full use of the cargo door without interfering with the cargo door frame opening. The door can be motorized and controlled from the cockpit. The weight of the roll-up door is not to exceed 75 lbs with an objective of 60 lbs. see interior and exterior example views below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Red/green jump/airdrop lights The drop lights have a red and green lens operated from the cockpit for indicating air drop operation phases. See photo above.</p>
<p>3. Static line bar The static line bar is located inside the cargo bay for attaching air drop bundles for static line deployment. See photo above.</p>
<p>4. Cockpit control &amp; status panel The control and status panel provides the status and control of the roll-up door and the red/green drop lights. An indicator is provided to show door open status, red light on and green light on. If the roll-up door is motorized, the control panel will control up and down movement of the door. The Red/Green drop lights are turned on and off from this panel as well.</p>
<p>5. Cargo Door removal kit (Wind deflector) The wind deflector is a vented spoiler that installs in the hinges of the cargo door after the cargo door has been removed to reduce wind inflow into the cargo door opening during air drops. Weight is not to exceed 5 lbs with a desired weight of 0.1 lbs. See photo right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;6. Roller Floor The roller floor is made up of light weight modular units with button rollers to allow movement in any direction. The removable modular panels lock into chair rails and/or inspection plates. The loads tie down to chair rails through openings in the roller floor. The loadmaster should be able to walk on roller floor panels with positive traction to prevent slipping on the rollers. The reconfigurable modular units align tracks to accommodate 18"x24", 18"x36", and 36"x36" Low Cost Low Altitude (LCLA) bundle sizes. The total weight of the roller floor system is not to exceed 100 lbs with a desired weight of 80 lbs. See photos below for a concept drawing example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. Radar Altimeter The radar altimeter has an operational range from 75 ft to 2,000 ft Above Ground Level (AGL). If a radar altimeter is not provided an uncertified, calibratable altimeter similar to a wrist jump altimeter located near the roll-up door opening is desired.</p>
<p>Production Aircraft Kits Once the flight test is complete and the Military Type Certificate (MTC) is received, the contractor shall produce and transport 24 additional aircraft kits to Shindand, Afghanistan. The contractor shall install the kits on the 24 C-208 aircraft on the flight line. Acquisition planning is estimating that two kits can be installed per month over a one year time frame. The contractor shall be responsible for providing their own security protection during the field installation of the 24 kits.</p>
<p>Q4: Please provide estimated production schedule for the air drop modification.</p>
<p>Contractor Maintenance Support The contractor shall maintain the two C-208B aircraft with Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P) certified mechanics from the time the government provides the aircraft (pick up point in Afghanistan) until the contractor ferries the aircraft back to Afghanistan. This is anticipated to take 6-8 months. All FAA maintenance checks, as well as Service bulletin inspections/maintenance actions are required to maintain FAA air worthiness certification. Any parts or fluids required to perform maintenance shall be supplied by the contractor.</p>
<p>During the flight test events, the contractor shall keep one aircraft flight test ready at all times. Both aircraft must be flight worthy to transport between test ranges (Eglin AFB and Peterson AFB) when scheduled. It is anticipated that approximately 100 to 150 hours will be put onto the combination of both aircraft during the flight tests. This does not include ferry flights around the US or transport to and from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In addition, the contractor shall provide any repair necessary to support air drop modifications made to the aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide technical expertise on the operations of the aircraft to support the flight test activity. The contractor shall support any discussions and/or changes needed to the air drop configuration to support the flight test program.</p>
<p><br />Support Equipment The contractor is to provide a floor cargo scale to weigh LCLA bundles and pallets up to 40" x 48" x 48" in size weighing from 30 to 500 lbs. One scale is to be provided to the flight test organization to support the flight test and later sent to Afghanistan to support the training program and production phase. Two additional scales are to be sent to Afghanistan when the production phase is to start. A total of three scales are to be provided.</p>
<p>C-208 Pilot Provisions &amp; Ferry Operations The contractor is to provide two (2) C-208 qualified FAA certified pilots to perform the following flights:<br />1. Ferry from Afghanistan to modification facility, if required. This includes temporary install per STC of fuel blatter tank and removal once at destination in the US.<br />2. Fly from modification facility to Eglin AFB, to Peterson AFB and back to Eglin AFB for flight testing.<br />3. Fly the aircraft during the flight test maneuvers, as needed, at the Eglin AFB test range and at the Peterson AFB, Colorado test range. A Range pilot will be provided as co-pilot by the Test organization to provide test range procedures. The Eglin flight tests are anticipated to last 1-3 weeks. The Peterson flight tests are anticipated to last one week.<br />4. Fly at Eglin AFB for training contractor familiarization flights. Max duration is a couple days.<br />5. Ferry from modification facility to Afghanistan after MTC is complete. This includes temporary install per STC of fuel blatter tank and removal once at destination in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Low Cost Low Altitude (LCLA) Airdrop Bundle Assembly and Delivery The contractor shall collect the LCLA bundle parts and ship to Afghanistan during the training and production phases of the contract. The LCLA bundles used during the flight test will be provided by the test organization. The first and second production run will include extra supplies to conduct a one year training program (separate contract effort). This version will be shipped in 2 increments during the year. The contractor shall provide a secure storage method for storage of the LCLA system parts until needed. These parts will be shipped to Shindand.</p>
<p>After completion of the one year training program, the contractor will ship the third and follow-up production shipments every three months for the duration of the contract period. These shipments will be divided among three separate bases to support airdrop operations. The contractor shall provide a secure storage method for storage of the LCLA system parts until needed at each of the two additional bases. The list below shows the parts, NSN numbers and quantities that make up the LCLA bundle system. These quantities will be adjusted during the flight test program to define the final quantities of the parts that make up a bundle configuration.</p>

<DESC>The Kiowa Warrior Product Management Office (KW PMO) has identified a potential need for replacement of the 5x7 quote mark  and 6x8 quote mark  multifunction displays on the OH-58D and OH-58F due to obsolescence. PM KW is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and fielding of a capability that enables the OH-58D/F platform to meet its MFD requirements. The replacement should ideally be non-developmental, plug and play with the current OH-58D and OH-58F architecture, and provide increased capability.  PM KW is seeking information on MFDs that provide onboard processing capability that can support both internal and external computing tasks as well as monitor type MFDs that solely display information provided directly from other computing sources such as mission computers, sensors etc.  If non-developmental solutions are not available, information on COTS solutions and what developmental changes would be required to meet specification requirements is requested.  <br>  <br>

No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.<br />The Rocky Mountain Region of the US Forest Service anticipates awarding two or more indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) work. The IDIQ will have a base year and four option years. Forest Service management direction includes emergency response, rehabilitation, and restoration of resources. More specifically, management includes the implementation of emergency and non-emergency land treatments to meet the objectives of protecting watershed values and land uses within watersheds. These emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration contracts include the use of proven effective land treatments to meet agency objectives. The land treatments that are part of these contracts are aerial-based applications of mulch (agricultural or wood). These are very common treatments that are used for BAER, watershed improvement, road maintenance and habitat improvement programs. Mulch applications have been found to be effective at reducing erosion and runoff on burned areas, construction sites, and other areas where a protective surface cover can lessen recovery time. The success of emergency response, rehabilitation and restoration of watersheds relies on the ability to mobilize and implement expeditiously. The intent of these contracts is to meet objectives of protecting, rehabilitating, or restoring watersheds and other land resources.

For agricultural straw mulching, the contractor will be responsible for procuring the straw, providing ground transportation of the straw to the helicopter staging area, and loading and dropping the straw via helicopters at specified locations. For wood shred mulching, the contractor will not be responsible for procuring or manufacturing the wood shred. The contractor will be responsible for transporting government furnished wood shred from a location within 100 miles of the helicopter staging area. The contractor will then be responsible for loading and dropping the wood via helicopters at specified locations. The size of the treatment locations will vary significantly for each task order and may range from 10's to 1000's of acres in size. <br />The work may occur within Region 2 of the USDA Forest Service, which includes forest lands within the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas.<br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 115310 (support activities for forestry). The size standard is average annual receipts of less than $7 M. Only small businesses are invited to respond to this Sources Sought.

<DESC>This is a sources sought which seeks qualified small businesses capable of meeting the Navy's requirement for removal of existing sealant and replacement of EF-5992 coating on the E-6B aircraft. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than determining whether or not there are enough small businesses capable of meeting our requirements. Further, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. The Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. No contract shall be awarded from this market research.
<p>The proposed project will be a Firm Fixed Price contract for the supplies and services necessary to remove existing sealant and replace it with EF-5992 coating on the E-6B aircraft located at Tinker AFB. This requires a Federal Aviation Administration certified contractor to use a high pressure process to completely remove existing sealant from the external surface of the front and rear wing spars from the wing-to body joint, , WBL -6/BBL 70.5 which is WS 0.00 (LE) and WS 109.45 (TE) extending out to the wing tip, WS 960.112 (LE and TE) as well as the internal surfaces of the front spar in the wing dry bays. To minimize depot flow time, work must be performed simultaneously on both wings within a twenty day time frame (10 days for stripping and 10 days for sealing). The twenty day requirement is based off of the Heavy Enhanced Phase Maintenance (EPM) flow-time of 180 days. This requirement necessitates the use of two teams with immediate access to specialized equipment to work simultaneously on both wings.</p>
<p>Interested and small businesses should submit a brief capabilities statement package (no more than three pages) demonstrating their ability to meet the Navy's requirements herein. Interested companies should indicate whether or not they are a small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) small business, HUBZone small business, SDVOSB, or WOSB.

<p>I BACKGROUD:</p>
<p>Securing the Department of Defense (DoD) against cyber attacks has become one of the nation's highest priorities. To achieve this objective, networks and systems, as well as the operations teams that support them, must vigorously defend against a variety of internal and external threats. To respond to those attacks that are successful, defense mechanisms must be in place to detect and stop follow-on attacks within internal enterprise networks. A critical component of such a defense system is continuous monitoring, ability to automatically test, and validate whether current security measures are working to remediate proactively vulnerabilities in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A. The contractor will prepare a Contract Management Plan (CMP) describing the technical approach, organizational resources, including contract budget, labor category breakouts, and management controls. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and project schedule will be provided with the CMP as separate documents. The CMP cost and schedule data will serve as the guide against which the government will monitor contract progress.</p>
<p>B. The contractor must analyze the Information Assurance (IA) products and technologies designed to build or enhance security architecture(s), create security implementation documentation, analyze and evaluate security architectures standards, architecture, engineering, and integration support; analyze and evaluate security patches, security patch testing; analyze and evaluate security releases; security measures and environmental transport/system network of infrastructure, and components of the network.</p>
<p>C. Cost Model Analysis: The contractor will provide technical support for a cost model analysis for CTO. The cost model analysis must present cost guidance associated with the implementation of security applications from desktop to enterprise.</p>
<p>D. Cyber Security Implementation, Engineering and Information Assurance (IA) Support. The contractor will provide, implement, train required personnel, and support the technical security solution that will monitor, detect, analyze, protect, report, and respond against known vulnerabilities, attacks exploitations, and continuously test and evaluate information security controls and techniques.</p>
<p>E. Training Support. As part of the product delivery and implementation, the contractor must provide products, solutions, and training to highly skilled individuals who perform planning, configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting functions to maintain effectively the Cyber Security product in an enterprise environment, stand alone computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>F. Professional Service:<br />1. Technical Engineering and Configuration. The contractor will provide mid-level engineering and configuration services to configure the commercial Cyber Security software. The contractor will also supply engineering and configuration services to assist DISA in maintaining Cyber Security and the underlying components.</p>
<p>2. Quality Assurance. The contractor will provide the CTO with documentation and test cases that demonstrate 100% functionality of Cyber Security within the DoD enterprise. The contractor will provide documentation for applications that perform at less than 100% functionality within Cyber Security. The documentation will state the functionality that was unable to be achieved within Cyber Security and the contractor will explain why the application did not meet the 100% functionality requirement including lessons learned to provide future 100% functionality.</p>
<p>3. Industry Best Practices Process Management Support. The contractor will provide the CTO with process management support using industry best-practice frameworks and standards including ITIL, ISO/IEC 20000 and 27001, Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), Six Sigma and Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), to facilitate a streamlined and repeatable process environment.

<SUBJECT>RFI - Improved Helmet Suspension System
<SOLNBR>M67854-12-I-1079
<RESPDATE>101012
<CONTACT>Lisandra C. Torres, Phone 7034323265, Email lisandra.torres@usmc.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) Product Manager Infantry Combat Equipment (PdM-ICE) is conducting market research, and identifying potential sources and best practice information for designing, developing, and procuring an Improved Helmet Suspension System (IHSS). The PdM-ICE is interested in learning about new technologies for helmet suspension systems that incorporate the comfort and low velocity/high mass impact protection provided by a pad system, with the stability and high velocity/low mass impact protection provided by a sling system. When used with Marine Corps helmets, the IHSS will help reduce and/or prevent concussions, skull fractures, and other injuries caused by blast, blunt impact, and ballistic trauma to the head.</p>
<p>The IHSS must be capable of preventing head acceleration from exceeding 150 G (gravitational constant) at an impact velocity of 14 feet per second [T], 17.1 feet per second [O] at temperatures ranging from -24&deg; to 120&deg; F. The IHSS must also dissipate the behind helmet ballistic impact energy transferred to the head to less than 1500 pounds force [T], 750 pounds force [O]. Additionally, the IHSS must provide stability and comfort for the helmet, without increasing the weight of the current Marine Corps helmet systems. The IHSS must not create hot spots, headaches, or skin irritation. It must also allow air to circulate under the helmet and prevent perspiration from running down underneath the helmet into the wearer's eyes.</p>
<p>The IHSS must integrate with Marine Corps helmet shells (Enhanced Combat Helmet, Advanced Combat Helmet, Lightweight Helmet, and Modular Integrated Communications Helmet) and other head-borne equipment such as night vision goggles and ballistic eyewear. Several variants of the IHSS may be needed to accommodate all of the Marine Corps helmet shells. The IHSS must not change the area of head coverage provided by existing systems or change current helmet sizing. The IHSS must be durable enough to withstand daily use for a six-month period of time after exposure to battlefield contaminants (petroleum, oils, lubricants, solvents, and insecticides), salt, fog, high altitudes (up to 40,000 feet), and extreme temperature variations (-60&deg; to 160&deg; F). The IHSS must not melt or drip after exposure to flames. The IHSS must also be easy to install with no special tools, use, maintain, and clean.</p>
<p>The PdM-ICE will hold an Industry Day on 17 October 2012 at 1000 Corporate Drive, Suite 301, Stafford, VA 22554, from 0830 to 1215. The afternoon will be reserved for one-on-one discussions with the government. Parties interested in scheduling a half hour one-on-one discussion should contact howard.girvin@usmc.mil by 10 October 2012. For those who are unable to attend the Industry Day in person, there will be a phone line set up to call into the conference. The phone number is (703) 432-2663. Enter bridge number 3 followed by password 4039. The first one to dial into the bridge will hear constant ringing until another party enters the bridge.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Industry Day is to exchange information regarding this RFI and the IHSS draft performance specification. The agenda for the Industry Day will be as follows:</p>
<p>0830 - 0900 Welcome/Introductory Briefing<br />0900 - 1000 Program Brief/Objectives <br />1000 - 1100 Overview of Government Research Efforts<br />1100 - 1115 Break <br />1115 - 1215 Informal Discussions with Industry/Question and Answer Period<br />1300 - 1700 Individual Breakout Sessions</p>
<p>All sources that plan to attend the Industry Day on 17 October 2012 should send confirmation and written questions via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, howard.girvin@usmc.mil (with a courtesy copy to the Contracting Officer, lisandra.torres@usmc.mil). Please provide the name and position or title of each attendee (no more than two per company), contact information, and business size. All requests to attend Industry Day should be submitted no later than 1630 on 10 October 2012. Unregistered attendees will not be turned away unless space is unavailable.</p>
<p>Following the Industry Day, industry is requested to submit an information paper that describes new helmet suspension systems being developed, and outlines the technical approach industry is using to meet the performance requirements specified in this RFI. Alternative designs for a retention system that integrates with the proposed suspension system will also be considered. It is requested that the information paper also include information on the technical maturity of the proposed design, schedule for initial test article submittal and possible production capacity, lead times, estimated cost of prototype and production ready systems, as well as the potential contractor's manufacturing capability. Comments to improve the performance specification or other requirements outlined in this RFI are also welcome. Although this RFI is focused on suspension systems that integrate with existing Marine Corps helmet shells, industry may also provide information about additional design ideas for suspension systems that are not constrained by the existing helmet shells. All submissions shall be provided electronically to howard.girvin@usmc.mil by 16 November 2012. Due to email restrictions, all electronic submissions must be smaller than 5MB. All properly marked proprietary information will be appropriately handled. Submitted material will not be returned. Please send requests for a copy of the performance specification for the IHSS and the IOP-PED-002 and IOP-PED-003 to the above mentioned Contract Specialist and Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>All questions presented before and during the Industry Day will be addressed during the informal discussions portion of the agenda. Questions presented during the Industry Day will be submitted via writing at the end of the research overview brief portion of the day. At that time, a short break will be taken where the questions will be compiled, after which questions will be answered during the informal discussion for everyone's benefit. After the Industry Day, all questions, answers, information discussed, test protocols, and any other information requests will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov/).</p>
<p>The Berry Amendment will apply to any contractual instruments regarding future procurement actions resulting from this RFI. Inability to attend this Industry Day (whether in-person or via teleconference) will not preclude any interested party from responding to future notices regarding this effort.</p>
<p>THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO ENTITLEMENT TO PAYMENT OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT COSTS OR CHARGES BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL ARISE AS A RESULT OF SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI AND GOVERNMENT USE OF SUCH INFORMATION. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.</p>

<SUBJECT>--Intent to Sole Source - Illumina
<SOLNBR>F13PS00063
<CONTACT>Valarie Reinholz

<a href="mailto:Valarie_Reinholz@fws.gov">Valarie_Reinholz@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>SUBJECT: Notice of Intent to Sole Source to Illumina.  This announcement constitutes the only notice. This is not a request for quotes.
A determination not to compete is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Responses must be received no later than Friday Dec 7, 2012 by sending an e-mail to valarie_reinholz@fws.gov; however, any technical data received will be for the sole purpose of market research for future requirements.
Under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), Fish & Wildlife Services, Region 1 Contracting and General Services intends to issue a sole source, firm-fixed price order to: COMPANY: Illumina  DUNS: 033305264  NAICS:  334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing AUTHORITY: 8.405-6(a)(2) Limited Sources Justification and Approval 13.106(b) Soliciting from a single source Determinations not to compete this proposed procurement were made because:
The Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencer (NGS) is a bench top instrument designed specifically for low throughput and small genome projects. The MiSeq system has an integrated workflow design that incorporates clonal amplification, sequencing, and data analysis in a single instrument. The operating system for the instrument is based on Windows7, which is compatible with DOI infrastructure. The Ion Torrent, the instrument most closely competitive with the MiSeq, operates on a LINUX system, the use of which would require additional training of Genetics Section personnel to perform computer administrative functions on the instruments data server because the LINUX system is not supported DOI-IT.
The MiSeq instrument has the best documented performance among the competing instruments related to sequence accuracy, which is of primary concern for forensic application. Precision and accuracy are important for the validation of new genetic markers to support forensic genetics protocols, results of which may ultimately be presented in a court of law. Resequencing required to address sequence errors results in much higher cost per run, and undermines confidence in data to be presented in court. In addition, the MiSeq protocol minimizes hands-on time in sample preparation and sequencing. Hands-free automation reduces the chance for sample confusion and other handling errors that could compromise data used for law enforcement forensic support.
The MiSeq instrument has the widest application flexibility of the competing instruments as well, and will facilitate analysis of multiple individuals or multiple species simultaneously for genetic marker identification. Runs on the MiSeq NGS are conducted with individual reagent cartridges, which allow efficient operation and data collection on an intermittent basis, rather than having to operate the instrument continuously to achieve highest efficiency. The MiSeq utilizes the Illumina Experiment Manager which offers an automated method of tracking sample analyses, format and syntax errors in reaction setup, and tracking experimental conditions and data collection, all of which are compatible with data tracking and documentation requirements of the NFWFLs ISO 17025 Laboratory Accreditation QC Protocols.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.</strong> Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this request to ensure that, in the event the Government chooses to issue a formal solicitation, every effort will have been made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. As such, responses to this request must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses. The following regulatory guidance applies to this Request for Information (RFI):<br />FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of determining costs associated with the provision, deployment, operation, and recovery of Insitu ScanEagle or Integrator unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to support scientific research and data gathering on remotely located marine mammals. Information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in identifying sources that are capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) with the requirements stated below.<br />(End of provision)<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br />The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), conducts research and monitoring on remotely located species which are covered under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act and considered for listing as threatened or endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). The population sizes in these remote areas, which represent the fundamental numbers for evaluating the species' status under the ESA, are imprecise, outdated or simply unknown. The collection of population sizes and other scientific data on remotely located species is a frequently challenging and potentially hazardous endeavor, but the insight it provides can significantly aid in the agency's improved understanding of habitat preferences, as well as sensitivity to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. The use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for marine mammal research is still in development, though it has the potential to provide a useful and efficient platform for conducting certain types of marine mammal research. <br />DESCRIPTION and TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS<br />Respondents are asked to provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate that addresses the scientific and technical challenges for each of the deployment methods listed below:<br />Shipboard deployment<br />&bull; Requires shipboard integration of a launch/retrieval system on a research vessel (vessel will be provided - no vessel charter costs; workshop space provided on the vessel)<br />&bull; Assume required UAS operators will board and disembark the vessel in Nome, Alaska.

<DESC>United States Department of the Interior NATIONAL PARK SERVICE Northern Rockies Major Acquisition Buying Office (MABO) Yellowstone National Park PO Box 168 Yellowstone National Park, WY 82190 	 
Justification for Brand Name Products
Date:	12/03/2012
Project:	2 Each Rebuilt 8V92 Detroit Engines. 1.	Identifications a.	Agency:		National Park Service b.	Contracting Office:	Yellowstone National Park
2.	Description of the action being approved: Engines must be rebuilt be an authorized Detroit Diesel approved rebuilder.
3.	Description of supplies and services: Product	Estimated price Rebuilt 8V92 engines	$30,000.00  4.	Authority:	 a.	41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. b.	FAR Part 11.105: The Brand Name products are essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other companies' similar products do not meet and cannot be modified to meet the agency's needs. c.	FAR 6.302-1: The use of the name brand products are essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
5.	The description of the product's unique qualifications or the unique nature of the acquisition: Yellowstone National Park Special Projects needs two Detroit 8V92 2 stroke diesel engines rebuilt. The Detroit 8V92 engines are used on the rotary snow plows for spring opening. Due to the extreme operating conditions and the Park Spring opening time restraints it is imperative that these engines are overhauled with genuine Detroit parts and all labor involved in the overhaul process is performed by Detroit Diesel authorized repair facility. Yellowstone Park Fleet Management requires overseeing the complete engine overhaul and dynometer engine break in period. To insure compliance with contract specifications and time restraints set by Yellowstone National Park Fleet Maintenance.
6.	Efforts to obtain competition: a.	Efforts to ensure offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable: For acquisitions over $25,000 the solicitation will be issued on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov. b.	Presolicitation notice per FAR 5.2: For acquisitions over $25,000 a presolicitation notice shall be posted on the Government's Point of Entry, FedBizOpps.gov unless the exception noted at FAR Part 5.202(a) (13) applies.
7.	Determination that costs will be fair & reasonable: The quoted price will be compared to the Independent Government Estimate and previous year's purchases.
8.	Description of the market research conducted:
9.	Other facts supporting other than full & open competition: a.	Reason why documents suitable for full & open competition have not been developed: The 8V92 engines requiring overhaul are used in spring opening rotary snowplows. To meet Yellowstone National Park spring opening deadlines the engines must be rebuilt by the most reliable rebuilder with OEM parts, and have the quickest turn time available. Detroit Diesel is the original engine builder and the sole provider for original equipment manufacturer OEM replacement parts. Detroit Diesel will furnish the most reliable rebuilt engine at the most completive price within the time restraints set forth by Yellowstone National Park Fleet Maintenance. b.	Data, estimated costs or other rationale as to the extent or harm to the Government: Improper rebuild and inferior replace parts could result in down time to one of the rotary snow plows resulting in delays to Yellowstone National Park Spring Opening. The additional cost accrued by Fleet Maintenance employees on the engine replacement could cost Yellowstone a minimum of 80 additional labor hours 10.	Interested Sources: Interstate Power Systems 1140 Main street Billings Montana 59103 11.	Actions to remove barriers to competition in the future for similar acquisitions: Yellowstone National Park Fleet Maintenance need to update the 8V92 two stroke Detroit engines to the best available technology thus providing the  ability to purchase off the shelf power plants for our rotary snow plow fleet.
12.	Certifications:
a.	Technical / Requirements Certification:
"	I do hereby recommend the use of the Brand Name products noted above for the procurement noted above. "	I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command Fleet Logistics Center, Pearl Harbor (NAVSUP FLCPH), on behalf of Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMS PAC), plan to issue contract modifications to extend the current contract N00604-12-C-3035 for Operations and Maintenance of Navy communication, electronic, and computer systems at various locations on Oahu for up to a maximum period of two months on the basis of other than full and open competition. Sole source modifications are consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
 This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of initial contract award. The extension will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend performance for a period not to exceed two months, beginning on 1 January 2013. This option extension will further allow for evaluation and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for this option as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency requirements if extensions are not executed before the contract expiration date.  

This notice is not a request for proposals.
 No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email or U.S. mail, to the attention of Julie Nguyen-Livic using the contact information provided in this synopsis.

<DESC>The primary purpose of the Data-to-Decision (D2D) Program is to develop a capability to rapidly develop, evaluate, and field prototype Decision Support Systems. Today's warfighter has access to text-based information from a wider range and greater number of sources than ever before. The influx of information can potentially improve warfighters' situation understanding and decision-making. However, it is clear that there has been, and will be no, increase in the number of warfighters to process and interpret the growing volume of available data. The practical implication of this is that the DoD has access to more data than it can process to achieve actionable information in support of diverse military information needs. It is imperative that we create, harvest and exploit technologies that will help realize the potential for improved decision-making without imposing a need for increased warfighter numbers or their workload. On behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering (ASD (R&amp;E)), the Office of Naval Research (ONR)) is interested in receiving white papers for the Data to Decision Program. The program has three (3) primary thrust areas, (1) contextual understanding, 2) event prediction, and 3) machine translation and processing.

<p>352.239-73 Electronic information and technology accessibility.<br />(a) As prescribed in 339.201-70(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:<br />Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility (January 2010)<br />(a) Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, and the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board Electronic and Information (EIT) Accessibility Standards (36 CFR Part 1194), require that, unless an exception applies, all EIT products and services developed, acquired, maintained, or used by any Federal department or agency permit-<br />(1) Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities; and<br />(2) Members of the public with disabilities seeking information or services from a Federal agency to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use of information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities.<br />(b) Accordingly, any vendor submitting a proposal/quotation/bid in response to this solicitation must demonstrate compliance with the established EIT accessibility standards. Information about Section 508 is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final Provisions can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/provisions.htm. <br />(c) The Section 508 accessibility standards applicable to this solicitation are identified in the Statement of Work/Specification/Performance Work Statement. In order to facilitate the Government's evaluation to determine whether EIT products and services proposed meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, offerors must prepare an HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, in accordance with its completion instructions, and provide a binding statement of conformance. The purpose of the template is to assist HHS acquisition and program officials in determining that EIT products and services proposed support applicable Section 508 accessibility standards. The template allows vendors or developers to self-evaluate their products or services and document in detail how they do or do not conform to a specific Section 508 accessibility standard. Instructions for preparing the HHS Section 508 Evaluation Template may be found under Section 508 policy on the HHS Office on Disability Web site ( http://www.hhs.gov/od ).<br />(d) Respondents to this solicitation must also provide any additional detailed information necessary for determining applicable Section 508 accessibility standards conformance, as well as for documenting EIT products or services that are incidental to the project, which would constitute an exception to Section 508 requirements. If a vendor claims its products or services, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, meet applicable Section 508 accessibility standards in its completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template, and it is later determined by the Government- i.e., after award of a contract/order, that products or services delivered do not conform to the described accessibility standards in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor and at its expense.<br />(End of provision)</p>

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days of contract expiration.<br />(End of Clause)<br />52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 10 days of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 4 years and 6 months.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

Submit forms per the document instruction and to the Port Engineer. A courtesy copy (CONUS West Coast performance locations only) to Ermanno Magliulo, Engineering Director, at ermanno.magliulo@navy.mil will be appreciated.</p>
<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342.

The quote should not simply rephrase or restate the Governments requirements, but rather shall provide substantiation as to how the offeror intends to meet the requirements.

<DESC>Plese note:  The pre-solicitation number was N00039-12-R-0017.
The estimated date for solicitation release has been updated from October 2012 to November 2012.  The estimated award date is July 2013.

The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), on behalf of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) and PMW 770, the Undersea Integration Program Office, intends to issue a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) for continued development, maintenance, and sustainment of the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) Control and Management (C&M) software for submarine and other platforms.
The CSRR was developed as a replacement for the existing OHIO Class submarine Integrated Radio Room (IRR).  CSRR has been implemented on the USS OHIO, USS VIRGINIA, USS SEAWOLF, and USS LOS ANGELES Class submarines.  The CSRR integrates physical components from other Programs Of Record (PORs) (i.e. Automated Digital Network System (ADNS), Digital Modular Radio (DMR), Extremely High Frequency/Follow-On Terminal (EHF/FOT), Global Broadcast Service (GBS), Super High Frequency (SHF), Submarine Single Messaging System (SubSMS), and ancillary equipment) into a common architecture.  The CSRR C&M software effectively manages these physical components to control, process and disseminate Command, Control Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) information to provide the submarine fleet with secure, reliable, and covert communications.
The technical approach to this effort is based on the concept of a CSRR that includes a common open systems architecture, common software, common technical documentation, and a single Software Support Activity (SSA).  The common software configuration approach includes the structure of the code; the databases used to track requirements, software source files, baseline documentation, host equipments/processors, and the verification and validation process/ procedures.  The contractor will be required to maintain and provide enhancements to the existing CSRR C&M software, the most recent version of which will be provided to the successful offeror at contract award.
Software code and specification documents associated with the CSRR C&M software will be provided to industry on a separate secure site limited to U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  The Government anticipates providing updated software code and documents periodically through the procurement process.  It is the responsibility of interested offerors to monitor the information contained on the website to ensure they are accessing the most recent versions.  To request access to the secure website, each company must sign and return the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) posted on the SPAWAR e-commerce site entitled, "Bidder's Repository NDA" and provide the e- mail address and phone number for up to two users to Patricia Ponce-Feliu patricia.poncefeliu@navy.mil.  Each user is required to be a U.S. DoD contractor and have a valid DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or ECA issued PKI certificate to gain access to the website.  If an interested company is a U.S. DoD contractor and does not have a valid DoD or ECA-issued PKI certificate, contact Mike Philbrook for further instruction.  Once status as a US DoD contractor has been confirmed, the Government will provide instructions on how to access the secured site.
The Government anticipates issuing a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) type contract.  The period of performance will be five (5) years (one base year and four one-year options).
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330- Engineering Services.
The estimated date for solicitation release is October 2012.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>RFP 226264 <br />One C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System<br />November 21, 2012
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program has been operating zenith pointing cloud radars at its ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF) for over a decade. These radars, operating in the Ka and W bands, have provided years of invaluable data pertaining to cloud structure and dynamics. However, vertically pointing radars have their limitations in that only a two dimensional view of the cloud is obtained. Millimeter wave radars are also poor precipitation radars since they saturate in light rain and experience excessive atmospheric loss due to atmospheric liquid water.</p>
<p>As part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARM procured four C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radars (CSAPRs). Three are located at ARM's SGP site in Oklahoma and a fourth is located at ARM's site in Barrow, Alaska. To differentiate between the previously delivered CSAPRs and the new CSAPRs being procured by this specification, the new radars are referred to as CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>The Technical Specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the transportable CSAPR-2.</p>
<p>Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division (Battelle) acting under Prime Contract DE-AC05-76RL01830 with the US Department of Energy (DOE), for the management, operation and maintenance of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, is interested in receiving a proposals for one C-band Scanning ARM Precipitation Radar System, delivered and installed at PNNL in Richland, WA.</p>

<p>Question: Is there a USTDA definitional mission proposal format?</p>
<p>Answer #1:</p>
<p>No, Please read the combined/synopsis solicitation that posted in FedBizOpps(FBO) or www.fbo.gov :</p>

<p>&bull; The contractor shall submit a Technical Proposal, not exceeding 25 pages, that documents their Technical/Financial Expertise and Definitional Mission experience.</p>
<p>&bull; In addition, the contractor shall provide a separate Business/Cost proposal on the SF-1449; a completed Contractor Employee Biographical Data Sheets for proposed key personnel; and a completed Contractor Price Quotation Breakdown via http://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/dmdocuments.asp.

<p>Question #2</p>
<p>Question: Is further detail available on prospective Chilean projects to be examined during the definitional mission?</p>
<p>Answer #2:</p>
<p>USTDA has received further detail concerning some of the prospective renewable energy projects to be evaluated and intends, of course, to share that information with the selected DM contractor. However, for purposes of this solicitation, USTDA considers that adequate information has been provided in the SOW in order for offerors to provide statements of their relevant experience and qualifications based on the types of energy projects to be reviewed.</p>

<p>Amendment Number: 002 (A002) <br />Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>1. Could you provide further details, if any, on evaluation criteria-such as weights given to staff, firm experience, approach/work plan, and technical/price offers?</p>
<p><strong>Answer: <br />See Combined Synopsis/Solicitation posted on FedBizOpps (FBO) or www.fbo.gov under solicitation number RFQ-CO201351044 that list six (6) evaluations factors.</strong></p>
<p>Question:<br />2. Period of performance is said to be one year from signature, although all deliverables are due by April 2013-does this mean there will be a retainer following the DM's completion for any follow-on work or advice needed?</p>

<DESC><p>This is a revised posting based on additional market research.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice. The Department of the Air Force, 746 Test Squadron (746 TS) Holloman AFB, NM, has a requirement for the design, fabrication, integration, delivery and installation of a network of at least sixteen (16) Non-GPS-Based Positioning Systems (NGBPS) using both solar and firm power for use on White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), NM. This system will enclose LocataLites, Part Number: ASY:01007-1, firmware, software, and signals. The Locata units have been purchased under a previous contract and will be furnished by the Government.</p>
<p>The principle objective of this contract effort is to deploy a network consisting of enclosures which integrate Locata part number ASY:01007-1 into a minimum of 16 enclosed systems. Each system will be environmentally secure, ruggedized semi-permanent/portable enclosures which are able to connect to prime or solar or power (12 to 24 VDC), provide protection from the weather elements between 5% to 100% humidity and temperatures between 0 and 130 degrees F, but maintain an acceptable internal environment to effectively operate the equipment within component manufacturer specifications. They must be maintenance friendly, and house the following characteristics/components: Locata transceivers, amplifiers, meteorological collection devices, power converters/sources, and other equipment required to amplify the signal and communicate with Locata rovers and other transceivers. Each system must be able to remotely power on/off, and transmit system health and test data back to the master station and synchronize all network ground transceiver transmitters. Each element must be integrated and will operate as a system. Multiple systems will operate together as a network. Communication links must be on WSMR approved frequencies with DoD certified equipment.<br /><br />A total of twenty (20) monument sites (2 monuments per site) will be required to be erected at Government designated locations on WSMR. The monument sites will be permanent fixtures suitable for survey applications and durable enough to support both transmit and receive antennas, masts, and the structures. The sites must endure wind and other environmental elements without moving, tipping, etc. Cabling will run through the middle of the monument and connect to the enclosure. The maximum height allowed is two (2) meters and the deployed system must be below the antennas mounted to the monument. Each site will have a meteorological station capable of measuring temperature, pressure and humidity. The main unit will be located in the enclosure or an environmentally protected location. Probes and sensors shall be mounted appropriately for optimal data collection.<br /><br />Command and Control Systems will be installed in two separate and mirrored configurations; one on Holloman AFB, NM and one in a C2 trailer for use at fixed sites on WSMR. These systems will provide the ability to power on and off the network over a distance of 60 miles. Communication links must be on WSMR approved frequencies with DoD certified equipment.<br /><br />A full list of Government Furnished Property (GFP) will be provided with the solicitation. The Government has some components already purchased and will be available to the contractor after award. The Contractor will be responsible for purchasing any additional components needed to ensure all enclosed systems are identical and interchangeable.<br /><br />To ensure Locata components are installed in a manner which protects warrantee coverage, contractors will be required to attain certification as a Locata Technology Integrator (LTI) prior to receipt of GFP. This certification is provided by Locata, Griffith ACT 2603, Australia, and will be the responsibility of the contractor to schedule and pay for certification costs. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by any potential contractor who wish to attain this certification prior to receipt of award.<br /><br />A single award contract is contemplated and will be set-aside for small businesses. Competitive procedures under FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process will be utilized. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless communications Equipment Manufacturing. The associated Small Business Size Standard for NAICS 334220 is 750 employees.<br /><br />The Government anticipates utilizing a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. The Government expects to post the solicitation on FedBizOpps on or around 18 Dec 2012.</p>
<p>An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting point of contract identified below. The Ombudsman is Col Douglas W Jaquish, AFTC/CV, 1 South Rosamond Boulevard, Edwards AFB, CA 93524; his phone number is (661)277-2810. Collect calls will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Jonathan Heitkam, telephone 575-572-1245 or email jonathan.heitkam@holloman.af.mil. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this notice.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers - Tenth Round. Answers are in response to Tactical Power Supplies PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U Market Survey posted on 25 May 2012. <br>  <br> Question #1 - In reference to the New Q&A, have the drawings or SOW been changed or updated since we received ours back mid June? <br>  <br> Answer #1 - The drawings and specifications that the Government has been sending out since June 2012 to present date remain as the latest released documents. <br>  <br> Question #2 -  quote mark ......respectfully requests a meeting with your team in advance of the solicitation to discuss some of our advancements in this area. We are available anytime at your convenience.  I will give you a call shortly to follow up. Please feel free to call me in the interim or respond to our email.  Thank you in advance and we look forward to hearing from your team. quote mark  <br>  <br> Answer #2 - Please refer to www.fbo.gov Solicitation Number W15P7T12RA307 Notice Type: Modification/Amendment, Question and Answers - Ninth Round, Question #8, posted 20 November 2012, which states that the Contracting Officer is not able to meet with any of the interested sources to discuss Power Supplies, or any other program. <br>  <br> Question #3 - I have read the latest set of questions/answers in the link below (see link in answer #3 above).  I believe that the response in the link below precludes meetings with potential bidders after the solicitation is released to discuss this opportunity.  Please advise if I am incorrect. <br>  <br> Answer #3 - Questions and Answers posted as Special Notice via FedBizOpps on 24 May 2012 states:  quote mark Please be aware that all questions will be answered through FedBizOpps. Please do not ask questions that cannot be submitted for FedBizOpps public view. Please allow up to 10 business days for answering any additional questions. quote mark  <br>  <br> In addition, once the Request for Proposal, (RFP), is released, relevant industry concerns and questions pertaining to the requirement will be answered collectively by the Contract Officer.  <br>  <br> Question #4- Question/Answer #2 (from Q&A 9th round posted 20 NOV 2012) seems to indicate that this is a small business set-aside.  Question/Answer #9 indicates that this full and open.  So I am confused? <br>  <br> Answer #4 - Answer #2 from Q&A 9th round states,  quote mark ...this requirement remains a 100% small business set aside. quote mark  Answer #9 indicates,  quote mark ...Full and Open competition after exclusion of sources;... quote mark  That means all responsible sources which meet certain criteria, such as business size, are permitted to compete. <br>  <br> Question #5 -- In response to the Q&A released on 11/20/2012, we would like to verify that the above referenced solicitation is a 100% small business set-aside.   <br>  <br> The response to Question #2 stated that it was 100% small business set-aside, however the response to Question #9 stated that  quote mark the contract will be issued under Full and Open competition after the exclusion of sources;  any small business concern under the small business size status for NAICS 335999 can provide a proposal. quote mark   Please verify the subparagraph of FAR Subpart 6.2 - Full and Open Competition after Exclusion of Sources. <br>  <br> Answer #5 - Please see above Answer #4. <br>  <br> Question #6 - Please advise if there has or will be any update changes to the drawings and specs since your previous email in July. Please forward the  updates/changes if they are available. <br>  <br> Answer #6 - Please see above Answer #1. <br>  <br> Question #7 - Can you confirm if this is going to be a small business set-aside or a full and open competition?  Also, is there a technical data package (TDP) for these power supplies. <br>  <br> Answer #7 --For first question-see above Question/Answer #4. For second question-The Government Technical Data Package (TDP) consists of performance specifications and drawings. Q&A 9th round Question/Answer #1 posted 20 November 2012 on FedBizOpps states  quote mark Drawings and Performance Specifications are being released in advance of the solicitation. Please send your request to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil. quote mark  <br>  <br> Question #8 -- Will anything change from them, (performance specifications and drawings), when the new solicitation comes out?  <br>  <br> Answer #8 - See Answer #1. Furthermore, at this time, the Government does not anticipate a major change to the performance specifications or drawings that have been previously released to industry to the performance specifications and drawings that will released with the solicitation. <br>  <br> Question #9 - Who is the program manager for the tactical power supplies? <br>  <br> Answer #9 - At this point, I, (Bobbi Baldwin) am the only Point of Contact for this requirement. The program manager information is procurement sensitive. <br>  <br>  <br> **Please note new phone number for contract specialist, Bobbi Baldwin, phone 443.861.4880. <br>

<DESC>The USG respectfully requests our industry partners help us maintain the integrity of this analysis by following the guidelines and process for seeking clarification.  Several questions have been asked of outside organizations that are not responsible for the study or data analysis.  Please ensure that all questions are electronically submitted to the Contracting officer using the email AASRFI@peoavn.army.mil. <br><br>The following Question and Answer is provided:<br><br>Question:  Can you help clarify the USG's intent to instrument the aircraft for the VFD?<br><br> Answer:   During the one-on-one industry day engagements, several OEMs mentioned that their demonstration aircraft were already instrumented and asked for clarification as to the Army's desire for adding additional instrumentation.  Subsequent to Industry Day, the USG made arrangements with each OEM desiring to conduct a demonstration to discuss the instrumentation package installed and the data elements to be collected.   The outcome of these discussions will include additional instrumentation, if necessary, as well as the data elements the USG has interest in collecting.  Each OEM will be informed of the USG's desire at these discussions.  <br><br><br>Releasibility of Attached ICD:  A releasability statement is contained in the attached ICD which restricts dissemination of the ICD; however, releasibility has been authorized by HQDA DAM-CIC, 400 Army Pentagon, Washington DC 20310 for the purposes of responding to this RFI.   <br><br><br>

<DESC>This synopsis amendment references the previous notices concerning SSDD DOMS, W31P4Q-11-R-SSDD and W31P40-12-R-DOMS to clarify issues under W31P4Q-12-R-DOM2 concerning Joint Ventures. <br>  <br> All W31P40-12-R-DOMS notice references to  quote mark informal Joint Venture quote mark  are hereby removed, because there is no language in the FAR or CFR that states the words  quote mark informal Joint Venture. quote mark  <br>  <br> Issue 1: The requirement to establish a separate business entity is in conflict with the definition of an informal JV. <br>  <br> Clarification of Issue 1: There is no FAR or CFR definition of an  quote mark informal JV. quote mark   13 CFR 121.103(h) defines a joint venture as: -  quote mark an association of individuals and/or concerns with interests in any degree or proportion consorting to engage in and carry out no more than three specific or limited-purpose business ventures for joint profit over a two year period, for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill, or knowledge, but not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally quote mark . <br>  <br> The joint venture entity cannot be awarded more than three contracts over a two year period, starting from the date of the submission of the first offer or it will be determined to have a general affiliation (3-in-2 rule). <br>  <br> A joint venture must: be in writing and do business under its own name. <br>  <br> It may (but need not): be in the form of a separate legal entity, and if it is a separate legal entity it may (but need not) be populated (i.e., have its own separate employees). <br>  <br> What is a Separate Legal Entity?  A business that has a separate legal identity from its owners. It can start legal action against another business or individual in order to protect itself. Other businesses and individuals have the right to take legal action against the business. Separate Legal Entities are chartered by the states where they are organized. <br>  <br> What is an Entity? In the System for Award Management (SAM), an organization is now referred to as an  quote mark Entity. quote mark  REGISTERING for a (CAGE Code) IN SAM IS FREE. You need to set up a SAM account. Your entity registration will become active after 3-5 days when the IRS validates your TIN information. <br>  <br> Your Entity's DUNS Number: You will need a DUNS to register your entity in SAM. If you do not have a DUNS number, you can request a DUNS number for free by visiting D&B at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. It takes 1-2 business days to obtain a DUNS. <br>  <br> Your Entity's Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN): A TIN is an Employer Identification Number (EIN) assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To obtain an EIN visit: www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=102767,00.html.  Activating a new EIN with the IRS takes 2-5 weeks. <br>  <br>  <br> Issue 2: An informal JV can take the form of a Prime and Subcontractor relationship, and therefore would not be a separate legal entity. <br>  <br> Clarification of Issue 2: A JV need not be in the form of a separate legal entity but it must be in writing and do business under its own name, therefore it must be an entity. SBA may also determine that the relationship between a prime contractor and its subcontractor is a joint venture, and that affiliation between the two exists, pursuant to 13 CFR 121.103 (h)(4). <br>  <br> Any offeror submitting an offer to a SSDD DOMS solicitation as a joint venture entity must comply with the requirements of 13 CFR 121.103(h) which requires the joint venture to be in writing and must do business under its own name (entity), hence the requirement for joint venture to have a Name, CAGE code, DUNS and TIN, like any other entity desiring an award of a federal contract.

<DESC>The Library of Congress FEDLINK program is inviting vendor comment on the draft&nbsp;solicitation for FEDLINK Information Retrieval Services.&nbsp;<br /><br />FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortia sponsored by the Library of Congress (LC or The Library). Under the revolving fund created by the Library of Congress Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 182c.), LC uses its extensive knowledge of the information industry and library operations to establish multi-agency contracts (MACs) for commercial library/information products and then makes these contracts available to other federal agencies, the District of Columbia, and contractors authorized to use federal sources of supplies. The Library of Congress FEDLINK Program is the executive agency for the procurement of Information Resources via the Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) solution.

Federal agencies can leverage spending to the maximum extent possible through FEDLINK's strategic sourcing program.<br /><br />The objective of the solicitation is to establish Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity&nbsp;(IDIQ) Contracts for acquisition of or access to commercial off-the-shelf electronic information resources for the FEDLINK program.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">DHS has&nbsp;extended Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00048&nbsp;for two and a half (2.5) months for core mission research and development test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) laboratory operations and support services. The proposed period of performance for this action is December 1, 2012 through February 15, 2013.<br /><br />The TSL requirement still exists for&nbsp;continued critical core trace and simulant laboratory operations and mission support to allow sufficient time for a new competitive acquisition to be awarded.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On November 23, 2012, OPO issued Request for Quotation (RFQ) HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 under GSA e-Buy. RFQ HSHQDC-12-Q-00264 includes the research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) services that supports the TSL mission and which are presently covered under&nbsp;Task Order HSHQDC-12-F-00048.&nbsp; The estimated milestone timeline for the award of new contract vehicle under the RFQ exceeds the period of performance available on the current Task Order and it is critical that TSL continue to maintain contract coverage while the RFQ proposal evaluations are underway.&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated timeframe for award is during the early part of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor. <BR> <BR>(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.    (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.    (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use.

Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section. <BR> <BR>(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information.

Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.    (i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included.

Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches. <BR> <BR>The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence <BR> <BR>(Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:        (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and        (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.      (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:        (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and        (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.      (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered. <BR> <BR>contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor. <BR> <BR>Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense. Expenses incident to the examination and testing of materials or supplies that have been rejected will be charged to the contractor's account. <BR> <BR>a) To improve the timeliness of payments and lower overall administrative costs, VA strongly encourages contractors to submit invoices using its electronic invoicing system.  At present, electronic submission is voluntary and any nominal registration fees will be the responsibility of the contractor. VA intends to mandate electronic invoice submission, subject to completion of the federal rulemaking process.  At present, VA is using a 3rd party agent to contact contractors regarding this service.  During the voluntary period, contractors interested in registering for the electronic system should contact the VA's Financial Services Center at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The IDIQ awardees will compete for task orders from the USAF Rocket Systems Launch Program (RSLP) for space launch services for missions of the Department of Defense and other government agencies. As described in the RFP, each task order will fall into one of two categories (called "Lane 1" and "Lane 2") based primarily on the mass of the space vehicle to be launched (with the higher-mass range being "Lane 2"). Two IDIQ contracts are being awarded for each lane. Each of the two awardees in each lane will compete for task orders in the corresponding lane on a lowest-price-technically-acceptable basis. Task orders may be awarded during a five-year period expected to end 12 DEC 2017, with each task order expected to have an initial-launch-capability date within two years of the task-order award date.<br />The primary locations of performance of the work under these contracts will be Magna, UT, for Lockheed Martin; Chandler, AZ, for Orbital Sciences; and Hawthorne, CA, for SpaceX.
