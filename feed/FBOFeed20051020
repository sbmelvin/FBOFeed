<DESC>The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)/NBC/GovWorks intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement the Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) using the Advisory Multi-step Process as outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 15.202.  The resulting contract will be a negotiated effort for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with, but not limited to, FAR Parts 15 and 12.  This is a reprocurement. General Description of Scope: This is a reprocurement effort.  The Financial and Business Management System (FBMS) will be the fundamental functionality-driven solution supporting administrative management of the Department; hence, it represents a critical and intrinsic part of DOI's business architecture.  The objective is to provide Interior with standard business practices supported by a single, integrated finance and administrative system for all Bureaus.   The potential winner of this award will serve as the main integrator and provide project management for the implementation of a suite of software applications that will help Interior manage a variety of business functions, including: Budget Formulation, Core Financials, Personal, Real, and Fleet Property, Acquisition, Travel, Financial Assistance, and Enterprise Management Information. As the Nation's principal conservation agency, Interior, with its 80,000 employees and over 2,400 locations, serves as steward for approximately 507 million acres of America's public lands and their natural and cultural resources.  Interior also supervises mineral leasing and operations on more than 634 million acres that underlie both Federal and other surface ownerships.  Interior's annual budget is about $13 billion.  In addition, DOI raises around $9 billion in revenues from energy, mineral, grazing, timber, recreation, and land sales.  DOI's mission is achieved through hundreds of programs and activities carried out by its eight bureaus and one principal office: Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Minerals Management Service (MMS), Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation, and Enforcement (OSM), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and Office of the Secretary (OS). The Government anticipates the issuance of  a single Performance Based Indefinite Delivery, Requirements contract using Best Value, Source Selection, Trade-Off procedures in accordance with FAR Parts 15 and 16.  The Indefinite Delivery Requirements Not-to-Exceed amount is $80 Million for the life of the contract. The contract duration consists of a base period and four one-year option periods subject to the availability of funds. Up to two Firm Fixed Price Task Orders may be issued in the solicitation for price evaluation. The first Task Order will be awarded with the basic Requirements contract and will require the development of the implementation schedule that is subject to an Integrated Baseline Review.  Future task orders may include solutions in support of the FBMS program.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519 with size standard of $21.0 Million. Large businesses are required to submit a Small and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan with their Statement of Qualification (SOQ) showing acceptable levels of subcontracting with small, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned, veteran-owned small business (WO/VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), HUBZone small business and HBCU/MI concerns. DOI's Small Business goals are SB 25%, SDB 5%, 8(a) 5%, WO/VOSB 5%, SDVOSB 3%, and HubZone 5%.

For each site it is anticipated that a four (4) day period of surrender will be used.  The surrender periods for the eight (8) sites are to start approximately six (6) months after contract award and the remaining seven (7) sites will have there surrender periods conducted approximately one every 2 months thereafter.  The program is anticipated to commence sometime in the November 2005-January 2006 period.  This program was tried out in Cleveland, Ohio by the USMS with the cooperation of local firms and organizations.  The results there were extremely promising and thus the USMS is interested in implementing it on a larger scale to see if the success in Cleveland can be duplicated.  

The program includes the following elements:
1)	Public/private partnership development directly involving elected and appointed officials (i.e. front-line law enforcement, prosecution and judiciary - city, county, state and federal) and senior executives of Fortune 1000 companies; 
2)	Closely reviewing state law (two examples: statutory definitions of "violent" versus "non-violent" offenses; domestic violence mandatory arrest requirements) and creating specific legal protocols agreeable to everyone that detailed which fugitives would be eligible for on-site release versus those to be arrested;
3)	Careful crafting of the public message from both legal and public relations perspectives - in close coordination with prosecutors, judges, public defenders and media: That is, not promising too much (i.e. "amnesty"), yet offering enough to lure fugitives ("favorable consideration") in accordance with state law and statutory sentencing provisions; and
4)	Development and extensive (six-week) training of a large (75+ members) faith-based volunteer organization to perform grass roots community engagement efforts, act as responsible (i.e. using only approved language) project spokespersons in the community and on radio and television, and perform key on-site logistical duties during the four surrender days.
5)	Iinterviewing surrendering fugitives, development of research instruments, and reporting of both qualitative and quantitative measures to evaluate the project's efficacy.
 

Currently the USMS has identified only one potential firm with the required capabilities to perform this function:  DC Strategic Partners, LLC, 516 East Parkway Boulevard, Suite 200, Aurora, Ohio  44202-8601.  The USMS intends at this time to award a sole source contract to the above identified firm.  However, the USMS is interested in seeing if other individuals/firms/organizations are capable of performing the above effort.  Should the capability statements show that other firms or organizations are capable of performing this effort a competitive solicitation will be issued in lieu of a sole source contract.  Therefore if interested parties that believe they have the capability to perform this effort should send capability statements to the email address in this notice.  Capability statements should be relatively short but should at the minimum: 1) list and describe prior similar efforts they have perform plus contact points to verify the actual performance on those efforts, 2) list key personnel, including subcontractors, and their experience on this sort of effort, 3) provide a representative list of faith-based organizations that the contractor would work with to perform this work and provide information showing that these organizations would be willing to work with the contractor on this sort of effort, 4) a short description of how the work would be performed.

Responses are due to the contact point by November 8, 2005.

Note to interested parties.  At this time the USMS does not have any funds to perform this effort, but anticipates getting funds to perform this work in the near future.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Odim Spectrum Services, 597 The Queensway, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada K9J7J-6, for the acquisition of testing support services and analyzing the Carriage, Stream, and Recovery System (CSTRS) system in flight as well as for resolution of known deficiencies and deficiencies found during testing.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  The winch and custom gearbox were designed and built by ODIM Spectrum.  The custom gearbox used by the winch is a highly modified planetary gearbox with unique operating characteristics.  The ODIM Spectrum design team also designed the rest of the winch system and the winch has many other specialized characteristics including a composite drum with unique grooving.  Being the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), ODIM is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced person!  nel necessary to successfully provide the required engineering and design services.  The costs associated with having another contractor reverse engineer any parts of the winch system would be excessive and would negate any benefits associated with a competitive procurement.  Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to ODIM Spectrum.  FSC Code: AD24.  NAICS Code: 541330.  Size Standard: $4.0M

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Mozambique Lurio River Hydropower Project.

With projected shortfalls in its energy supply as early as 2007 and 7% annual demand growth forecast for Mozambique, the country is keen to develop new sources of electric power.  Electricidade de Mozambique (EDM), the Grantee, believes that the Quedas & Ocua plants (or potentially Lurio 1), two greenfield plants located on the Lurio River, are the most viable projects going forward. These two separate facilities are expected to deliver 178 megawatts of installed capacity when taken as one development.  EDM, Mozambique’s public energy utility, requested the U.S. Trade and Development Agency’s  (USTDA’s) assistance with laying the groundwork for a concession to attract a private investor or a public private partnership to develop the project.

In order to conduct the above-stated study, USTDA has provided a grant to EDM to hire a U.S. consultant to complete the following summarized terms of reference:

Task 1: Preliminary Review
Task 2: Site Visits and Meetings with the Grantee
Task 3: Preliminary Geotechnical Study
Task 4: Preliminary Hydrological Study
Task 5: Preliminary Environmental and Social Impact Study
Task 6: Model Impact of Proposed Project on Interconnected System
Task 7: Review and Revision of Proposed Design for Civil Works
Task 8: Review and Revision of Proposed Selection of Electromechanical Equipment
Task 9: Design Rural Electrification Component for Project
Task 10: Legal and Regulatory Review
Task 11: Revised Cost Estimates and Financial Modeling
Task 12: Development Impact Report 
Task 13: Conclusions and Recommendations
Task 14: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $597,960 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Office (DITCO) intends to issue a sole source order to Arrowhead Global Solutions, Inc (AGSI) to continue network connectivity for the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) Alerting and Coordination Network (ACN).  ACN program operations support and telecommunications network connectivity are currently provided under General Services Administration’s 8(a)STARS contract.  Under that order, the ACN program operations support expires 05 July 2006; however, the telecommunications network connectivity expires 05 December 2005.  This sole source action will establish a seven (7) month bridge of the ACN telecommunications network connectivity with an expiration date that will coincide with the expiration date of the program operations support provided under the existing 8(a)STARS order.  The National Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications currently operates the nationwide ACN with contracted operational, administrative and technical support from AGSI.  AGSI has directly subcontracted with AT&T Government Solutions for the existing nationwide Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) -enabled, virtual private network to provide essential non-public switched communications among selected critical Government and Industry operations centers.  AT&T provides the wide area telecommunications network connectivity with AGSI providing management and technical oversight of all end-to-end services, (e.g., ACN Help Desk, ACN PBX’s, ACN Data Centers, ACN user devices, ACN Training/Documentation/Exercises, ACN Network Testing, and ACN activations).  The ACN network provides a stable, isolated emergency communications network that supports critical planning, provisioning, and restoration activities (i.e., natural disasters, terrorism, etc) when the Public Switched Telecommunications Network is inoperable, stressed, or congested.  The ACN is the critical link between major telecommunications carriers who in turn provide tactical on-ground telecommunications.  Under the current contract vehicle, physical telecommunications connectivity is provided to thirty-eight distinct locations distributed throughout the Contiguous United States of America (CONUS).  Any incoming telecommunications network connectivity provider may be required to conduct site visits to determine specific site requirements.  Removal of the existing AT&T circuit/router equipment in parallel with new circuit/equipment installation would be required.  Fully operational telecommunications network connectivity to support the ACN is required no later than 06 December 2005.  The de-installation/installation process would require close transition planning to ensure that potential service disruptions do not occur during site cutover.  Additionally, all efforts associated with providing the telecommunications network connectivity would be directly coordinated/managed by AGSI, who will continue to provide ACN program operations support, upon award of this order and throughout the 7-month performance period.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (d)(1)(B).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  All inquiries regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically and directed to Kathy M. Tullock, Contracting Officer, at kathy.tullock@disa.mil.  Estimated date of award is 30 November 2005.  All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole source contract.  Due date for responses/inquiries is 31 October 2005.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 517310.  The following Government-wide numbered notes apply:  1, 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation.  The solicitation is now available on FedBizOpps.  The Department of Education is seeking a solution that would allow the Office of Migrant Education to (1) leverage existing technology (at the State level) and applications to securely exchange student records on a nationwide basis, (2) protect the student's personal information, and (3) provide national level ad hoc and standard reports. OME is interested in technology that would define, implement, and maintain identity management (or a unique identifier among so many systems).  OME is also interested in providing this capability to institutions that do not currently have/use any existing State applications to track and report migrant students and would be interested in technology that could be securely accessed via the Internet to enter and share data with existing State-based applications and technology.

<DESC>COMBAT RESCUE TANKER (CRT) COMBAT RESCUE TANKER MARKET RESEARCH Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the Combat Rescue Tanker  (CRT) Integrated Product Team (IPT) are conducting advanced market  research looking for a new or modified tanker aircraft to replace or  augment the current fleet of fixed wing tankers that are used in the  combat search and rescue mission.  Candidate platform(s) will provide  Personnel Recovery/Recovery Operations (PR/RO) forces with the capability  to conduct in-flight and ground refueling of vertical lift assets, at a  minimum the HH-60 and V-22, and should have the capability to adapt to the  next generation (CSAR-X)  rescue platform.  It will also have the  capability to provide overt/covert airland or airdrop delivery of  Pararescuemen and their equipment.  In addition, the platform must have  the capability to perform the Airborne Mission Commander (AMC) mission. The platform must be capable of operating in 10 percent worldwide climatic  extremes as defined in MIL-HDBK-310., in all environmental regions of the  globe (e.g., arctic, desert, mountainous, littoral, tropical, etc.), day  or night, during adverse weather conditions, and in a variety of spectrums  of warfare to include passing through Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical  (NBC) environments.  The support and deployment concepts include the  capability to operate from main operating bases, forward operating bases,  and forward operating locations.   Onboard defensive capabilities must  permit the platform to operate in an increased threat environment.  The  platform must have an in-flight refueling capability from current  strategic tanker assets.  The platform must be capable of deploying  without immediate strategic airlift support and maintain sustained  operations with a minimum of support. The platform should be capable of refueling rotary wing and tiltrotor  (V-22) aircraft at airspeeds 105-180KEAS, and to incorporate a refueling  drogue that functions throughout that airspeed range without ground  reconfiguration.  It must also comply with Software Compliant Architecture  and Joint Tactical Radio Systems mandates, and also comply with  net-centric, airborne networking and IP networking architecture. Request that respondents provide a short statement of capabilities  relative to this requirement, to include aircraft manufacturing  experience, aircraft modification experience, software development and  integration experience, and systems engineering capability. Responses should be sent to: Major Rique Gwin HQ AFSOC/A5RM 100 Bartley St. Hurlburt Field FL 32544 A copy of each response should be sent to: John Dyson AERNAUTICAL SYSTEMS CENTER (ASC)MC130SS/PM 1895 Fifth StreetWright Patterson AFB OH 45433-7200 The required Initial Operating Capability (IOC) date for the CRT is 2011.

<DESC>Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) plans to recompete its contract for integrating Measurement and Signals Intelligence (MASINT) within the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System.  The Contractor selected to fulfill the requirements of this SOW shall be required to operate integrated MASINT capabilities within AF DCGS.   Specifically, the Contractor shall maintain the detailed framework upon which thorough operational planning and system development is accomplished.  The end result is to maintain the established functional/program management, maintain and implement Concepts of Operations (CONOPs)/Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, maintain the TPED capability/capacity commensurate with current and future sensors, establish a training program, and ensure adequate communications infrastructure resources.  More specifically the Contractor will focus on AF DCGS capability to handle MASINT tasking, processing, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED).  The System Administrator/Information System Security Officer (Sys Admin/ISSO) positions will be filled to address historical shortfalls in the USAF for these skill sets.  These personnel will be utilized by the assigned unit to perform Sys Admin/ISSO functions related to the unit’s mission, not limited specifically to support the AF DCGS MASINT equipment/software.  The AF DCGS is a system of systems architecture composed of fixed and deployable, scalable and modular ISR ground station components that provide multi-source intelligence to the warfighter.  These components are connected via a secure wide area network (WAN) to create a virtual multi-INT tasking, processing, exploitation and dissemination (TPED) environment.  The system employs a concept of data distribution, information sharing and collaborative work centers. The AF DCGS is part of the overall DoD DCGS architecture.  The AF DCGS is worldwide; with core location Distributed Ground Systems (DGSs), remote sites, and the DCGS Processing Exploitation, and Dissemination System (PEDS) Architecture (DPA).  In addition, other organizations provide support, directly and indirectly, to AF DCGS.  The AF DCGS provides integrated and flexible, multi-discipline intelligence satisfying warfighter requirements for all phases of military operations.   The system simultaneously tasks and receives, processes, exploits and disseminates data from national, theater, tactical, and commercial collection assets in a distributed environment.  It supports national, joint, combined, and AF operations.  It is capable of forward deployed, distributed (split-based), and in-garrison reachback operations.  Initial Operating Capability (IOC) was established 15 December 2002.
All services requested under this contract are non-personal in nature.   The anticipated contract award date is 17 Mar 06.

<SUBJECT>D -- Angel 4 Software
<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard intends to issue a sole source contract to National Direct Marketing Systems (NDMS), Atlanta, Georgia, to renew an expiring software license/maintenance of the existing customized Closed Loop Lead Fulfillment System “Angel” software product.  The “Angel” software provides an integrated leads management and recruiting software application tool which tracks all national and local “lead” statuses and reports recruiter activity and lead disposition throughout the entire recruiting process.  NDMS is the sole owner of the “Angel” software and owns the source code and will not release it to other vendors.  The contract period of performance will be a base year plus one (1) option year.  The statutory authority for only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii).  The required services are available from only one responsible source; award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements. This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal.     See Numbered Note 22.

The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. The extramural research and development program plays a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the Command. 
RESEARCH AREAS OF INTEREST
A.	ADVANCE DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS RESEARCH PROGRAM
The Advanced Diagnostics and Therapeutics Research Program (ADTRP) focuses on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of naturally-occurring endemic diseases with demonstrated or potential capability to decrease military operational effectiveness. Diseases of principal interest to ADTRP are respiratory, infectious and diarrheal disease caused by bacterial or viral pathogens. Other noteworthy areas include but not limited to metabolic disorders/diseases, blood and immune system, ophthalmology (vision correction, injury and biomarkers), and diseases or syndromes of interest to the military medical system. 
		1.	Research and Development of Preventive Measures for Infectious Diseases: The ADTRP supports studies to characterize infectious agents, identify pathogenesis and human protective immune responses.					
		2.	Research and Development of Therapeutics: Studies to screen, synthesize and develop therapeutics for militarily-relevant infectious agents are secondary to the prophylactic development program above. However, proposals dealing with novel drug delivery systems, i.e., sustained-release and methods of targeting drugs to reduce toxicity or delivery of drugs of clinical importance to the active sites are welcomed.  ADTRP supports studies for the development of enhanced human performance therapeutics.
		3. Diagnostic Systems: Studies applicable to the development of common diagnostic systems including platforms for detection, surveillance and diagnosis of naturally occurring infectious agents of military medical importance are considered of high clinical importance.  ADTRP also supports the development of diagnostic systems including immunologically-based and nucleic acid-based platforms as well as genomics and proteomics, pertinent to detection, surveillance and diagnosis of naturally-occurring infectious agents of military importance. Investigations to identify improved pertinent specimen collection and processing techniques will also be considered for funding.
B.	HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION RESEARCH PROGRAM  
The Human Performance and Systems Integration Research Program provides integrated capabilities for the protection of health and sustainment of military performance which may impact service members in the performance of their mission as it integrates with Air Force weapon systems.  Research is directed to an improved understanding of physiology, ergonomics and biodynamics in order to reduce risk to service members, protect against materiel and environmental hazards, and development of specifications, algorithms and models for strategies and interventions to protect health and performance.  This research program may be coordinated with programs funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory in the area of Human Effectiveness research.
Current areas of emphasis include:

C.	MILITARY OPERATIONAL MEDICINE RESEARCH PROGRAM
Operational medicine research include specialized medical materiel, capabilities and/or procedures designed to enhance force health protection, restore health, prevent casualties, enhance human performance, and maintain a fit and healthy force.
 Current areas of emphasis include:
1. Aeromedical evacuation: A primary emphasis of the Research Program is on the identification and development of medical techniques and materiel (medical devices, drugs, and biologics) for early intervention in life-threatening battle injuries, before and/or during medical evacuation.  In addition, there is interest in products to maintain casualties during prolonged evacuation.
2. Ground medical support: The research focus is on forward medical care to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with major battlefield wounds and injuries. The preference is on medical techniques and materiel that can be used by first responders, which means that medical materiel must be easily transportable, i.e. small, lightweight, and durable in extreme environments and handling; devices must be easy to use, low maintenance, with self-contained power sources as necessary. Drugs and biologics, ideally, should not require refrigeration or other special handling. 
Materiel and techniques must be simple and rapid to employ. Included in this area of interest are noninvasive or minimally invasive sensors to detect and warn of impending vascular collapse and/or significant tissue damage due to perfusion deficits. Examples: local and systemic hemostatic agents, treatments to enhance oxygen delivery and perfusion of tissue, equipment and procedures for effective fluid resuscitation of casualties, and enhanced resuscitation fluids.
3. Special operations medicine: Research efforts are needed in principles and technology available to monitor and sustain injured casualties during episodes of delayed or protracted evacuation; management of patients when treatment is delayed as a result of mission requirements; and enhanced capabilities for special operations unique environments. Also there is interest in non-invasive sensors, algorithms, processors, simulation, modeling and physiology databases for remote triage, monitoring and management of casualties.
4. Medical Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High Explosive (CBRNE):  Research focus is on environmental, safety and occupational health (CBRNE detection, identification, warning, and recovery) and integration of a full-spectrum response to natural and manmade disasters.  Also included are areas to provide preventive, primary and critical care of the population at risk, perform medical surveillance, and assist in rapid identification and hazard analysis of CBRNE agents.
5. Casualty prevention: This research area includes preventive medicine activities - based  on a view of total health risk required to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring the force is available for all phases of directed missions.
6. Clinical medicine: The primary interest is in the area of existing materiel for which concept and/or patient care efficacy have already been demonstrated, but require improvement to meet our military constraints.  Also of interest is research to provide improved medical management to enhance survival and expedite the return-to-duty through definitive therapies and life support technologies, reduce mortality and morbidity, and develop and demonstrate key technologies enabling biomedical principles that are both medically and militarily unique.
7. Human performance enhancement:  This effort includes research in the areas of improved cognitive performance, contribution to sustained effectiveness during high operational tempo, enhancement of human and machine interface, and enhanced battlespace situational awareness.

D.	BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH PROGRAM	  
The Medical Bioinformatics Research Program provides medical advances in molecular biology and equipment concerned with the creation of databases of biological information.   
The following are the overarching research and development focus areas:
	1. Design and develop interfaces whereby researchers can access existing information and submit new entries.
2. Computational Biology involving the identification of genes in the DNA sequences of various organisms.  Develop methods to predict the structure and/or function of newly discovered proteins and structural RNA sequences.	
3. Development of protein models to align similar proteins and generate phylogenetic trees to examine evolutionary relationships.

E.	DIRECTED ENERGY INJURY RESEARCH PROGRAM 
The Directed Energy Injury Research Program provides medical capabilities to detect and diagnose various types of injuries, ranging from sub-acute to chronic, as a result of directed energy devices.  The program will maintain the scientific base and technological capability to develop timely medical surveillance measures for both current and future directed energy threats. Research funded by this program will be used to identify concepts and candidate medical surveillance measures for use by individual service members or medical personnel. Basic and applied research are supported and may address topics as diverse as determining sites/mechanisms of action and effects of exposure to directed energy. Studies with emphasis on exploitation of biomarkers for surveillance and diagnostic technology, ocular pathophysiology, molecular modeling, and identifying sites and biochemical mechanisms of action, medical measures, and molecular biological and biotechnological development are highly encouraged. 
F.	TELEMEDICINE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM
The scope of the Air Force telemedicine program includes identification, exploration and demonstration of key technologies, and enabling biomedical principles required to overcome technological barriers that are both medically and militarily unique. Telemedicine is defined as “the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants.” The goals of this effort are to:  1) reduce the medical “footprint” and increase medical mobility while ensuring access to essential medical expertise and support; 2) improve the skills and efficiency of care providers; and 3) improve the delivery and quality of medical/surgical care throughout the AFMS. 
Achieving the goals of telemedicine will require new technologies and the application of existing technologies to uniquely military health-related problems, as well as integration with other DoD modernization initiatives in the areas of information systems, telecommunications networks, and logistics systems. 
Research and development is required to enhance the following capability elements: 
		1.	In-flight applications: This operational capability to use distributed medical databases and computer supported collaborative planning aimed to support in-flight care and guidance in an emergency.   
		2.	Medical Information Acquisition: Defined as the ability to rapidly acquire a full spectrum of multimedia clinical and operational information that will enable medical providers to rapidly diagnose, provide treatment, and report the information.  Other candidate technologies include but are not limited to mobile and wireless devices.
		3.	Telemedical resources: Effective employment of medical resources is the ability to more effectively and efficiently employ medical assets within the AFMS. It is dependent upon three functional capabilities: prognostics and planning, telemedical management of medical forces, and execution of time-critical medical missions. These capabilities allow the medical commander to better monitor and tailor medical forces to the needs of specific missions. It allows commanders to integrate medical assets throughout the AFMS and to better coordinate health care delivery. Medical Force Management is the ability to use advanced diagnostics, communications and information technology to more effectively manage medical resources both deployed and in garrison at the sustaining base. 
	4.	Biotechnology: The AFMS is currently transforming into a more responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable force (Future Force) than the current (legacy) force. Medical forces and assets will have to be efficient, effective and capable of supporting the full spectrum of military operations.      
There are several biotechnology areas that are important for the medical technology research community to exploit in order to achieve significant gains in combat support effectiveness en route to the Future Force. Specifically, prospective AFMS medical applications of biotechnology include: data fusion and storage, biosurveillance, consultant “store and forward” technologies, high-resolution imaging, and physiologic sensors.
G.	SPECIAL PROGRAMS
The AF/SGR is frequently directed by Congress to manage funding of research programs with specific goals and end-points for health related issues relevant to military personnel, military dependents, veterans, and the health of the American public. These research programs are generally concerned with topics relating to health-care delivery; detection, diagnosis, control or eradication of specified diseases, conditions, or syndromes; or other initiatives relevant to health needs. Funding of these areas is dependent upon Congressional direction and availability of funds.

2. Computational Biology involving the identification of genes in the DNA sequences of various organisms.  Develop methods to predict the structure and/or function of newly discovered proteins and structural RNA sequences.	
3. Development of protein models to align similar proteins and generate phylogenetic trees to examine evolutionary relationships.

E.	DIRECTED ENERGY INJURY RESEARCH PROGRAM 
The Directed Energy Injury Research Program provides medical capabilities to detect and diagnose various types of injuries, ranging from sub-acute to chronic, as a result of directed energy devices.  The program will maintain the scientific base and technological capability to develop timely medical surveillance measures for both current and future directed energy threats. Research funded by this program will be used to identify concepts and candidate medical surveillance measures for use by individual service members or medical personnel. Basic and applied research are supported and may address topics as diverse as determining sites/mechanisms of action and effects of exposure to directed energy. Studies with emphasis on exploitation of biomarkers for surveillance and diagnostic technology, ocular pathophysiology, molecular modeling, and identifying sites and biochemical mechanisms of action, medical measures, and molecular biological and biotechnological development are highly encouraged. 
F.	TELEMEDICINE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM
The scope of the Air Force telemedicine program includes identification, exploration and demonstration of key technologies, and enabling biomedical principles required to overcome technological barriers that are both medically and militarily unique. Telemedicine is defined as “the use of electronic information and communications technologies to provide and support health care when distance separates the participants.” The goals of this effort are to:  1) reduce the medical “footprint” and increase medical mobility while ensuring access to essential medical expertise and support; 2) improve the skills and efficiency of care providers; and 3) improve the delivery and quality of medical/surgical care throughout the AFMS. 
Achieving the goals of telemedicine will require new technologies and the application of existing technologies to uniquely military health-related problems, as well as integration with other DoD modernization initiatives in the areas of information systems, telecommunications networks, and logistics systems. 
Research and development is required to enhance the following capability elements: 
		1.	In-flight applications: This operational capability to use distributed medical databases and computer supported collaborative planning aimed to support in-flight care and guidance in an emergency.   
		2.	Medical Information Acquisition: Defined as the ability to rapidly acquire a full spectrum of multimedia clinical and operational information that will enable medical providers to rapidly diagnose, provide treatment, and report the information.  Other candidate technologies include but are not limited to mobile and wireless devices.
		3.	Telemedical resources: Effective employment of medical resources is the ability to more effectively and efficiently employ medical assets within the AFMS. It is dependent upon three functional capabilities: prognostics and planning, telemedical management of medical forces, and execution of time-critical medical missions. These capabilities allow the medical commander to better monitor and tailor medical forces to the needs of specific missions. It allows commanders to integrate medical assets throughout the AFMS and to better coordinate health care delivery. Medical Force Management is the ability to use advanced diagnostics, communications and information technology to more effectively manage medical resources both deployed and in garrison at the sustaining base. 
	4.	Biotechnology: The AFMS is currently transforming into a more responsive, deployable, agile, versatile, lethal, survivable, and sustainable force (Future Force) than the current (legacy) force. Medical forces and assets will have to be efficient, effective and capable of supporting the full spectrum of military operations.      
There are several biotechnology areas that are important for the medical technology research community to exploit in order to achieve significant gains in combat support effectiveness en route to the Future Force. Specifically, prospective AFMS medical applications of biotechnology include: data fusion and storage, biosurveillance, consultant “store and forward” technologies, high-resolution imaging, and physiologic sensors.
G.	SPECIAL PROGRAMS
The AF/SGR is frequently directed by Congress to manage funding of research programs with specific goals and end-points for health related issues relevant to military personnel, military dependents, veterans, and the health of the American public. These research programs are generally concerned with topics relating to health-care delivery; detection, diagnosis, control or eradication of specified diseases, conditions, or syndromes; or other initiatives relevant to health needs. Funding of these areas is dependent upon Congressional direction and availability of funds.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, “doing business as” name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day’s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of Payment” paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor’s CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the “Suspension of payment” paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>MULTI-COMMODITY PRICE FORECASTING

Background

TVA requires an integrated set of forecasted natural gas, coal, oil and emission allowance prices as input to its electricity price forecasting process, generation planning and risk management activities.  TVA requires short-term and long-term price forecasts for each commodity. TVA is especially interested in information on standard subscription services, including a detailed description of services and frequency of updates.  For TVA’s purposes, a semi-annual update for the long-term (20-year) commodity price forecasts is required.  

In order to adequately evaluate commodity price risk to the company, TVA is also interested in obtaining short- term and long-term price uncertainty for each commodity.  It should be noted that TVA is not only interested in the potential uncertainty range of prices in the future, but, more importantly, the potential paths the markets could take that underlie that uncertainty.  This includes an integrated set of stochastic uncertainties that can be used as input to the formation of electricity prices for the region.  

TVA envisions this to be an interactive process for the development of the first forecast.  Specific requirements are outlined below.

BIDS SHOULD INCLUDE RESPONSES TO THE FOLLOWING:

•	What standard subscription services do you offer and when are they released?

•	In general, what are your outlooks for the natural gas, coal, oil and emission allowance markets in the short-term, mid-term and long-term and what do you see as the major driver to each over these time periods?

•	Please provide a summary of the methodology you would use to forecast the potential price paths of each market.
o	Mean with 10%/90% probabilities or standard deviations to develop a distribution
o	Integrated set of stochastics for all of the forecasts  

•	How do you propose to maintain consistency with other electricity price drivers (e.g, correlation to coal, environmental regulations, load growth, etc.).

•	How do you propose to summarize your study for TVA?

•	What standard sensitivities (case studies) do you offer?

•	How often are your long-term forecasts updated and when would they be delivered?
o	Would there be an extra charge if earlier dates were requested?

•	Provide a list of other clients receiving your subscriptions and/or custom forecasts 

•	Provide a discussion of accuracy for your forecasts.

BIDS FOR INDIVIDUAL TASKS AND/OR ALL TASKS SHOULD INCLUDE PRICE BREAKDOWNS FOR THE FOLLOWING:

Task 1
Short-term and long-term standard products for all commodities.

Task 2

o	Any reagents available from the list provided
o	Transportation costs to all TVA locations
&#61607;	Electricity (if available)
o	Associated Electricity price in $/MWh for TVA and the surrounding areas

Task 3
Independent High and Low forecasts for Coal (by type), Gas, Oil and EA’s with associated probabilities (10%/90%) or standard deviations including all assumptions.  High and Low forecasts for Electricity if available.		

Task 4
Integrated Stochastics (with correlations if available) for Coal, Gas, Oil and EA’s.

Task 5
Integrated Case Studies (Scenario Analysis)
&#61607;	Price for any standard studies already produced 
&#61607;	Price for customized studies
&#61607;	Results would include all commodity prices and assumptions

<CONTACT>Bernice Mccorvey, Contracting Officer, Phone 850-934-9225, Fax 850-934-2400, Email mccorvey.bernice@epa.gov
<DESC>The following clarification is made concerning the time and material contract for hazardous waste.  The ceiling price on the contract will be $15,000.  The government does not guarantee this amount.  Information concerning time and material contract is listed in Federal Acquisition Regulation 16.601; however a description is listed below.  Website: www.arnet.gov

16.601 Time-and-materials contracts. 
(a) Description. A time-and-materials contract provides for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of— 
(1) Direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and 
(2) Materials at cost, including, if appropriate, material handling costs as part of material costs.

1)      Estimated quantities and configuration of wastes (ie.  Drums -  5, 30, 55 gallon.  Oil - in drums, bulk or pump able from EPA tanks )

It varies from pick-up to pick-up.  We usually have larger quantities of 10% sulfuric acid (approximately  120 kg), and  mixed solvents (approximately 100 kg).  We have numerous (100's) of expired chemicals in their original containers ranging from 5 mg to 1 kg.   Upon completion of the contract any container purchase for the purpose of completing this contract will be the property of the Government.  The contractor shall submit a list of container by nomenclature, part number and price to the contracting officer prior to purchase for approval.

2)	Is paint likely to be in 1 gallon or 5 gallon cans needing over pack, or is it in self-contained drums? 

Paint is usually in 1 gallon cans and sometimes 5 gallon buckets, typical products of a local hardware/paint store.  Note: We do not dispose of much paint.  

3)	Anti-freeze - cans, drums or bulk.  Will it be contaminated with other items?  

Usually in gallon containers - Spent anti-freeze from HVAC systems, automobiles, boats, research equipment, etc...  (no unusual circumstances)

4)	 Will EPA have or supply analyses on these waste streams or is this expected to be a function performed by the contractor

5)   The ceiling for prior year’s contract was $10,000.

The contractor must have the capability for analyses but the EPA will provide necessary info in approximately 90% of all cases.

A copy of prior year’s quantities is available upon request by 
e-mail, fax or phone.   Please provide an e-mail address or fax number.  A copy of the provisions and clauses will also be provided upon request.


The closing date for this is procurement is October 31, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. EST

Interpreting Services
October 20, 2005

The purpose of this amendment is to post questions/answers to inquires received.  All questions should be in writing and can be sent to Teresa Knotts at facsimile (614) 693-5674 or email at teresa.knotts@dfas.mil.  This solicitation is extended to 12:00 P.M. EST, Wednesday, November 30, 2005 pending a revision that will be published at a later date.


Questions and Answers

Question – Historical data – I was looking for a breakdown of the total hours by anticipated hours at each location; i.e., Charleston – 100 hours, Cleveland – 125 hours, etc.  I realize these wold be estimates only but would provide a better understanding of the different location’s anticipated needs.

Answer – The requirement is going to be revised to show a breakdown by location.


Question – I understand that the Charleston location is going to be effected by the recent BRAC announcements, are there others?  This would impact staffing over the entire potential term of the initial and option years.

Answer – A lot of these areas are on the BRAC list; however, it needs to be notes that this is not yet a final decision.  BRAC could also create more of a need for these services than they currently experience.  The requirement will be revised to point out those locations involved in BRAC.


Question – I see that the interpreter(s) must have passed the RID written and performance tests or the NAD test; are they also required to be a member of the RID or the NAD (private organizations) in order to work for the Government?

Answer – Certification is the requirement not membership in the RID.  However, further research is being done and the Statement of Work will be revised accordingly.
