<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Integrated Command and Data Handling (C&DH) and Electrical Power System (EPS) Avionics equipment, common with the equipment used on the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL)/Lockheed - Experimental Satellite System (XSS-11) Satellite NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Broad Reach Engineering.  We are investigating microsatellite designs that leverage DoD experience in missile defense and anti-satellite interceptors (Kinetic Kill Vehicle Hardware Integrated Test (KHIT), Lightweight Exo-atmospheric Projectile (LEAP), Terminal High Altitude Area Defense Weapon System (THAAD), Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV), Anti-Satellite (ASAT)), responsive space (Tactical Satellites (TACSATS), Miniature Sensor Technology Integration (MSTI)) and microsatellites for space support (XSS #10 and #11 and Autonomous Nanosatellite Guardian for Evaluating Local Space (ANGELS)).  In order to evaluate the avionics, flight and ground software, and software development tools developed by DoD, we require essentially duplicate equipment flown on a previous DoD mission: XSS-11.  The integrated C&DH and EPS avionics for the XSS-11 mission was designed and built by Broad Reach Engineering.  This company is the only source which can provide common avionics hardware fully compatible with the XSS-11 software and software development tools.  Use of other avionics hardware would be incompatible with the XSS-11 software, and thus would require additional engineering effort, leading to unacceptable lead times and raise questions regarding the validity of the evaluation. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than Noon local time on February 12, 2007.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 07-22 Quantum Sensors 
CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov; PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 PM (Arlington VA local time), March 1st 2007.  It is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the first selections.  Full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA07-22).  POC: Dr. Michael Zatman, DARPA/STO; Email: quantum@darpa.mil; Website: https://dtsn.darpa.mil/qsp.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency?s (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Quantum Sensors Program (QSP).  The objective of QSP is to develop practical sensors operating outside of a controlled laboratory environment that exploit non-classical photon states (e.g. entangled, squeezed, or cat) to surpass classical sensor resolution.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 ? 217 and PL 105-261 ? 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond (see the Proposer Information Pamphlet Section 3.2 for possible Conflicts of Interest and Ethical Considerations). Phase I of the Quantum Sensors Program is unclassified but still has publication restrictions. However, Phase II and all future phases of the program will be classified.
  
Proposers may be foreign firms or may team with foreign firms as long as the firm meets the criteria in this BAA and the Government is otherwise permitted to conduct business with the firm.  Proposers may include foreign personnel as part of their proposed resources as long as these personnel qualify technically, export control laws are complied with and such foreign personnel sign any and all appropriate non-disclosure agreements prior to participating in the research effort.  
This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction Agreement or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this Program are (of equal importance):  (a) Scientific Merit;  (b) Innovation;  (c) Technical Qualifications and Management; (d) Cost and Schedule Realism and Reasonableness; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates the proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.  Submission of classified proposals requires prior instructions and approval from DARPA as well as approval from the classifying agency.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP (Proposer Information Pamphlet) associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access the PIP www.fbo.gov, by emailing a request to quantum@darpa.mil, or by visiting the Quantum Sensors Program web site at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/qsp.

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to quantum@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The objective of this FX-AIRSS PRDA effort is to use applied research to design, build and fabricate a research and development (R&D) spacecraft with integrated WFOV, full-earth staring IR payloads attractive for missile detection from a geostationary orbit.  FX-AIRSS key risk mitigation priorities are schedule, cost, and performance.  The baseline schedule for award is late FY 2007.  The effort will be approximately 5-7 years in duration and composed of design, build, test, and on-orbit analysis and operations support.  Offerors should plan for an October 2010 launch date.  While this PRDA effort is in support of risk reduction for the AIRSS program, the AIRSS system development contract will be a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15 full and open competition.  

The purpose of the release of this draft FX-AIRSS PRDA is to solicit industry feedback in the form of a White Paper to assist the Government in refining the final PRDA solicitation.  White Paper submission should occur in anticipation of a final PRDA release.  The draft solicitation will be attached to this notice.

<DESC>The National Park Service plans to solicit proposals to rehabilitate the Sacramento Landing Boat Dock used for emergency response vessels at Point Reyes National Seashore, located in Marin County, CA.  The work of this project involves the removal of the existing pier and the construction of a new pier, gangway and float.  Proposals should include all necessary expertise, labor, materials, equipment, and tools as needed to perform demolition; pile driving; repairs/improvements to remaining bents; and to construct/install pile caps and bracing, stringers and decking, guardrailings, aluminum gangway, and floating dock extension.  The project will require the contractor to coordinate material and equipment needs and availability so that site work can begin on July 16, 2007.  Due to environmental restrictions, all in-water work must be completed by October 15, 2007 with final project work to be completed by November 15, 2007.  The magnitude of the project is estimated between $250,000 and $500,000.  An award will be made to one offeror who's proposal is determined to be the Best Value to the Government after consideration of price and factors other than price such as previous experience constructing and installing marine timber piers of similar design/construction; working in environmentally sensitive areas using methods that minimize impacts to the environment; monitoring safe work practices; and working in remote locations with adverse weather conditions.  An award may be made without discussions, therefore the initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms for all items from a price and technical standpoint. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available via electronic commerce only and may be accessed on/about February 13, 2007 at either http://www.fedbizopps.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be 30 days after the date of issuance of the RFP.  The Contractor is responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFP.  This acquisition is unrestricted and issued pursuant to Public Law 100-656.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which if timely received will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Ronald Ryder, Contract Specialist, (973)724-7220
<DESC>The U.S. Army Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command Acquisition Center on behalf of the Office of PM Crew Served Weapons has a  requirement for production ready Quick Change Barrel (QCB) conversion kits for the M2 .50 Caliber, 12.7mm Machine Gun. The M2 QCB conversion kit will upgrade the M2 Machine Gun into the M2A1 Configuration. The M2 Heavy Barrel (M2HB) is an automatic, recoil operated, link belt-fed, air-cooled machine gun that has been standard issue since 1923.  Slight upgrades have been performed on the M2; however, the weapon still requires the Soldier to manually calculate headspace and timing which, if done improperly, can damage the weapon and injure the user.  In addition, current barrel changing procedures negatively impact survivability as the Soldier must be exposed to enemy fire for extended periods of time while changing the barrel and setting headspace and timing.

After Phase Two proposals are reviewed, we plan to award a contract no later than mid-May 2007, and will require completion of construction by September 15, 2007.  We expect the 90% design package to be submitted for our review within 30 calendar days after contract award.  Reclamation will provide comments on the 90% design package and the contractor will be required to submit the 100% design package and begin onsite mobilization with 60 calendar days after contract award.     12. Contact Susie Kramer, Contract Specialist, at 208-378-5156, or by e-mail to skramer@pn.usbr.gov if you have any questions regarding this project. SCOPE OF WORK The purpose of this contract is to repair the existing roof of the Third Powerplant building; to reliably provide a structure free of roof leaks to protect the facilities of the Third Powerplant, and to afford a space where Reclamation may conduct the operation and maintenance of the Third Powerplant with low initial cost and with minimal roof maintenance requirements.  In addition, for the purpose of historic preservation, the proposed roof should create the same general appearance which the building's roof had when it was built:  a broad, uniform, featureless, light gray colored plane.  The Third Powerplant is a cast-in-place concrete structure with a precast tee beam roof approximately 85 feet above the adjacent grade, as shown on the drawings and photographs in the appendix.  The Third Powerplant is entirely within an area where access is restricted for security purposes.   The existing roof of the Third Powerplant is a spray-on rigid urethane foam insulation layer covered with an impervious spray-on silicone rubber coating.  The roof is approximately 104 feet wide by 1,090 feet long and is broken into ten approximately square areas by expansion joints.  The expansion joints, flashings, details at roof drains, and details at exhaust hoods are shown on the drawings in the appendix.  The original roof is approximately 30 years old.  It has been patch repaired in many places.  Approximately 35,000 square feet at the south end of the roof was repaired and re-coated under contract in 1997, as shown in the photographs in Exhibits 1 and 2.  Previous roof repairs are described in the appendix.  Many areas of the roof exhibit damage which includes blisters in the silicone coating at the top surface of the roof and cavities formed inside the urethane foam insulation.  We believe that the blisters and cavities are caused by moisture penetration and by heat from the sun.  Once blisters form, additional holes are caused by birds that peck at the loose, blistered, silicone coating.  We believe that the urethane foam insulation material has been damaged on approximately 10% of the area of the roof, based on a visual estimate.  We anticipate that repair of this roof will require at minimum, repair or replacement of the urethane foam insulation on 10% of the area of the entire roof (approximately 11,400 square feet) and repair or replacement of 100% of the impervious silicone rubber coating on the entire roof (approximately 114,000 square feet).  A twenty year warranty of the performance of the roof from both the installer and the manufacturer of the new roofing materials is desirable, although lesser warranties may be considered.    Much of the maintenance which Reclamation has performed on the existing roof is associated with the mechanism of blistering of the roof surface and with bird attack on the roof system.  It is desirable that the proposed roofing systems mitigate or eliminate damage by these mechanisms.   Access to the roof is limited.  The contractor may use the stairs at the south end of the Third Powerplant for personnel access to the roof.  The contractor will be assigned a staging area on the north side of the Third Powerplant at grade, adjacent to the Third Powerplant building.  All materials placed on the roof and all materials removed from the roof will be moved by crane or other suitable means directly into and out of the contractor's staging area.  The location of the contractor's staging area and the location of parking spaces adjacent to the Third Powerplant south stairs are shown on a marked print dated 1/8/2007 of Drawing No. 1222-D-316. All work performed under this contract shall conform with the requirements of the Reclamation Safety and Health Standards, Revised 2002, published by the United States Department of the Interior - Bureau of Reclamation, Safety and Occupational Health Office, Denver, Colorado.  These standards are consistent with the health and safety standards prevalent in industry, The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, Public Law 91-596, and Department of the Interior regulations.   The RSHS can be viewed at www.usbr.gov/ssle/safety/RSHS/rshs.html Structural design data is shown in the drawings in the appendix.  The roofing design shall assure sufficient slope to drain to prevent ponding. The total weight of all roofing materials which remain on the roof after construction is complete shall not exceed 3 psf.  Static loads on the roof during construction shall not exceed 30 psf live load.  On isolated small areas of the roof, not to exceed 12 square feet, static loads may exceed 30 psf, not to exceed 100 psf.  Proposed equipment loads will be evaluated in Phase 2.  The allowable load limits for dynamic loads will be less than allowable static load limits to account for impact and vibration.      On February 13, 2007, before Phase One proposals are due, there will be an informational site visit to assess the site and determine the general condition of the roof.   The contractors selected to participate in Phase Two may schedule another site visit, if necessary, to more specifically evaluate the roof to determine the extent of damage to the existing roof system and determine the quantities of urethane foam insulation material to be repaired or replaced, and other repairs if necessary.  Each of the Phase One successful offerors (who are eligible to submit a Phase Two proposal) shall submit a 30% level design with their Phase Two proposal.   At the 30% design level, designs are not required to include repetitive drawing details or complete descriptions of salient characteristics and standard association designations and parameters of specified materials.  The 30% design is also not required to show measurements that can be obtained later in the design process.  However, the 30% design needs to convey the intent of the design to the Government in enough detail to enable the Government to infer what the content of the 100% design will be, and to evaluate it in accordance with the Phase Two evaluation factors. Upon award of a contract, the 100% level design shall fully describe what materials will be installed (either by standard association designations or by trade name with salient characteristics listed), how all materials will be installed at all locations on the roof, and how the contractor's quality control program for this job will be conducted.   The 100% design shall include detailed drawings and may include written specifications.    Drawings required for Phase Two designs shall be made by computer using Autocad software in any of the following versions: 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006.  Hand-drawn drawings are not permitted. Drawings will be made in the contractor's customary style and format, and shall be no smaller than 11" x 17".  Drawings shall have unique drawing numbers or other identifiers and shall be dated. One original of each drawing submitted shall be signed by the contractor signifying that it is approved for use.  The seal and signature of a Professional Engineer or Registered Architect is not required.  Drawings shall include plans of the roof showing the locations where materials will be installed, certain physical information critical to material installation (minimum slope, for example), and typical installation sections and details.  Drawings at 100% design level shall be sufficiently detailed to show how all materials will be installed at all locations on the roof.  At the end of the awarded contract, after all other work is complete, the contractor shall create a set of final as-built drawings showing how all materials were actually installed, and shall provide the as-built drawings to the Government in both hard copy and in electronic files in DWG format.  Photographs and drawings for this project can be viewed at the following website: www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for the acquisition of various products developed by AdLib Software which make up their PDF/A conversion suite.  This software is required in order to convert native format documents into the PDF/A standard for storage in the official Department of State archive.  The chose of this document format (PDF/A) has been approved by NARA.  This purchase includes a subscription service that includes software fixes, technical support, and new product updates.  The Adlib Software PDF/A application software will be used as an automated conversation tool to convert 300+ different file formats into the approved open standard PDF archive format.  This conversion will allow access to archival documents far into the future and is also approved by NARA (National Archives Records Administration). A search of the internet and technical documents was done to obtain a list of venders that produced enterprise server based products to fulfill this requirement.  This list was narrowed down to three different products.  These products were brought in-house and evaluated. It was determined during this evaluation that the AdLib Software product was the best fit to our requirements for a number of reasons. 	IT-CCB - As SMART moves to deployment all the products that make up the core will have to go through and be approved by the IT-CCB/IA and DS processes by limiting the number of new unknown applications this process will be smoother and quicker to accomplish. 	Ease of use - One of the goals of the evaluation was to find a product that met our requirements and also was easy to install, configure and use. 	Scalability  Currently licensing of the product allows us to add additional conversion servers as we need to meet processing demands without having to purchase additional licenses. 	Cost  This product came in closest to the initial estimates we set aside for the PDF/A solution within SMART.<BR><BR>

Description:  The Ram Air Control Valve is part of the aircraft Environmental Control System (ECS).  This valve modulates the ram air flowing through the pre-cooler heat exchanger in response to current signals from the temperature controller.  The variation in the current maintains bleed air temperature downstream of the pre-cooler heat exchanger to a predetermined constant value.  This results in a controlled bleed air temperature downstream of the heat exchanger that is within safe operating parameters of the downstream components.  The Ram Air Flow Control Valve consists of an actuator, inseparable air duct assembly, left and right hand doors, electrical harness assembly, and servo control valve. 
Destination:  Shipping instruction to be given by PMS. 
Required Delivery:  3 EA, every thirty days ARO until order is complete.

<DESC>This Amendment is in Response to a Request for Clarification from an Interested Party:

Q: SUBSECTION 1.02 requires the contractor to obtain all Local, State and Federal permits.  We've bid on ATON Maintenance Projects for years, why does the contractor now have to obtain those permits?  Isn't the ATON Maintenance Work under a National Corps of Engineer Permit that the USCG has in it's possession already?  Asking a contractor to obtain these permits is well beyond their area of expertise.

A:  The USCG does not have these permits in place and due to staffing shortfalls the USCG is no longer able to obtain these permits in a timely manner.  We understand that this is not within an ATON contractors area of expertise, however we have incorporated in the budget the anticipated cost of the ATON contractor subcontracting this work to an experienced environmental firm.  The cost of this anticipated subcontract should be included as part of your proposal price.

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Free & Clear, Inc., 5826 Oregon Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20015 for a telephonic smoking cessation program to decrease the rate of smoking in veterans served by VAPHS. VAPHS serves approximately 55,000 veterans, and many veterans who use the system are unable to attend face-to-face smoking counseling because of travel distance or time constraints and therefore require an intense intervention delivered via telephone counseling. Although it is known that only a minority of smokers quit tobacco permanently after attempting to quit, VAPHS seeks a vendor who can provide strong evidence of high one-year quite rates from a smoking cessation intervention so as to maximize the value of the contract. Specific requirements of the contractor are as follows: 1. Ability to provide intense smoking cessation counseling via the telephone to a large population of smokers. 2. Ability to initiate the program throughout the healthcare system within 2 months of award of the contract. 3. Capable of assessing degree of nicotine dependence and making recommendation about pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. 4. Extensive experience in smoking cessation telephonic interventions that would indicate a high chance of success with patients, many of whom who have smoked for many years 5. Evidence of prior success showing smoking cessation one year quit rates that exceed 20%. Evidence of this success should include counting all smokers who enter counseling in the denominator and those who report being totally tobacco free 1 year later as the numerator (also known as intent to treat). Evidence of success should be available in scientific publications based on randomized controlled trials by authors who conducted investigations with the vendor, such that there is high confidence that the rate of tobacco cessation claimed is accurate and conclusions about the success of the program is valid. 6. Ability and track record of ability to work with a large complex geographically disperse organization 7. Counselors who have competency in providing counseling to economically disadvantaged populations and to a population with high prevalence of racial minorities. 8. A well developed approach and evidence of success in recruiting smokers to make a quit attempt with the assistance of telephonic counseling 9. Willingness to document smoking counseling in the VA electronic medical record system. 10. Ability to track quit rates on an ongoing basis and provide frequent data to the VAPHS regarding the number of enrolled patients and employees, and quit rates during the program, at the end of counseling, and after 1 year.  Significant interactive discussion" between the vendors counslors and veterans are required. If your firm has the capabilities to meet all of the above requirements and would like to be considered, please submit supporting information to Cassandra.Craven@med.va.gov or to Cassandra Craven(04A-H), VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206, NLT February 8, 2007, C.O.B.

2.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

a. The DoD is seeking information on automated, secure physical access systems.  The DoD is seeking vendor solutions that provide real-time, online, integrated, credential verification, identity authentication, and access authorization system.  This Physical Access Control (PAC) effort is designed to increase physical security by allowing access to valid DoD credential holders, and by vetting visitors and vendors who frequent DoD facilities and installations and providing these vendors servicing DoD facilities and installations, a method to more quickly gain access to these facilities to conduct official business.  

b. Participation in this Project, on the part of vendors desiring access to DoD facilities, is voluntary.  Key components of this Project include: demonstration of software; demonstration of architecture, demonstration on the ability to credential those who are not authorized DoD credentials, demonstration of the ability to complete background checks on companies and employees, the implementation of authentication and credentialing capabilities.  

c. The Contractor shall be required to:

i.

Software communication between DMDC and external systems is handled through web services and standard interfaces.   

ii.	(NOTE:  Physical access systems, identity management systems, and other types of systems communicate with DMDC Web Services (DWS) with Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages. To request data from Defense Biometric Identification System (DBIDS), these systems must be able to connect directly or wirelessly to a regional network and send SOAP request messages and receive SOAP response messages.  Integrated systems become network nodes acting as a service requestor. These nodes send a SOAP request message to the DMDC web service (DWS) which acts as a Service Provider. The DWS retrieves the requested data and sends a SOAP response message to the Service Requester. A client program connecting to the DMDC web service can read the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) document to determine what functions are available from the Service Provider. The client can then use SOAP messages to call one of the functions listed in the WSDL document for DMDC web service. Clients format SOAP messages with specific DMDC data requests. The DMDC web service formats SOAP response messages that contain the requested information, or an error message indicating the information could not be found.)

iii.	Capture fake/lost/stolen ID cards - An automated process which identifies that the credential being presented was reported as lost/stolen.

iv.	Link identity verification and credential verification.

v.	Take multiple biometrics at enrollment which enables biometric matching later.  

vi.	Revoke base access and transmit the revocation to all access points in the infrastructure.

vii.	Capture and maintain an audit history capability of who and how many people enter a facility.

viii.	Limit access based upon Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs).

ix.	Provide an authenticated verification of identity (target - two to six seconds).

x.	 Provide simple equipment operation for security force personnel.

xi.	Provide a method for Participant companies to enroll in the program. Enrollment shall be made available at each participant installation and facility.

xii.	Conduct Background Screening on Participating Companies and Selected Personnel.

xiii.	Conduct screening for visitors.

xiv.	Meet all privacy, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), networthiness, privacy, security and regulatory requirements. 

2. GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF COVERAGE:

Worldwide to include Europe, Southwest Asia, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii, the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, other U.S. Territories and Possessions.

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).

Overview:  Television services in AETC are currently provided on a one base-one contract basis. The Government seeks to consolidate television services to all thirteen AETC facilities and five Annex locations that meet or exceed the required service level through one command-wide television service contract. The vendor shall provide a "basic package" of channels at a minimal, reasonable cost defined as what is available on the local market for off-Installation subscribers. In accordance with (IAW) Air Force Instruction (AFI) 65-106, Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreations (MWR) and Non-Appropriated Funds Instrumentalities (NAFIS) dated 1 October 2002, TV service to billeting will consist of all major local affiliate networks (ABC, NBC, etc) base specific, one sports channel, one major news channel, and one family/children channel. In addition, a technical solution will be provided to support high speed internet HSI, video on demand and express checkout. The vendor will provide a ?commanders program package? base official service that will consist of all of the major local affiliate networks (ABC, NBC, FOX etc) base specific, two major news channels (ex. CNN, FOXNEWS), and the Weather channel. A rebroadcasting agreement shall be facilitated by the vendor according to AFI 64-101.1.2 in order for AETC bases to have the ability to rebroadcast available channels (ex. FOXNEWS, CNN, Weather Channel etc.) to desktop users via the base network. The rebroadcasting agreement(s) shall comense and expire on corresponding dates of the main Cable TV contract. The vendor will also provide the option for each base the capability for users to have access from their desktop to the Pentagon Access Channel. The cable operator must have or create franchise agreement(s) authorizing the construction or operation of a cable system on a federal installation according to AFI64-101.1.3.1. The vendor shall ensure that the system is designed, installed, and operated in a manner that meets or exceeds the technical standards required or recommended by the FCC as set forth in 47 CFR Part 76. The vendor recognizes that signal leakage or other interference, including emission, radiation, or induction, from the television system that affects the Government's air navigational, communications, or surveillance facilities, or other electronic device or equipment located on the Installation may disrupt or endanger military activities and may pose a threat to the safety of both the public and military personnel. The vendor shall address all necessary actions, including testing, maintenance, and coordination with government personnel to prevent any such leakage or interference. 

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to provide television services to 13 geographically separated CONUS Air Force facilities.

2) The vendor shall deliver television services via any FCC approved method: Cable TV, Satellite TV, TV over the Network, etc.

3) A rebroadcasting agreement shall be facilitated by the vendor according to AFI 64-101.1.2 in order for AETC bases to have the ability to rebroadcast a specified package of channels (?commanders program package?) to desktop users via the base network using a network compatible technology.

4) The vendor shall provide a ?commanders program package? that will include 3 national network news channels (ex. CNN, FOX NEWS, CNBC), a national network weather channel, and local news channels (base specific).  The ?commander?s program package? shall be offered via traditional television distribution (cable/satellite) and also to desktop users via the base network.

5) The vendor shall provide the option for each base the access capability to the Pentagon Access Channel.

6) The vendor shall provide TV service to billeting consisting of all major local affiliate networks (ABC, NBC, etc) base specific, one sports channel, one major news channel, and one family/children channel. In addition, a technical solution will be provided to support high speed internet HSI, video on demand and express checkout.

7) The Government seeks to consolidate television services to reduce the recurring service charges and infrastructure maintenance costs to the Government through use of innovative cost arrangements. Such arrangements could include but are not limited to on-demand services such as movies, video games, live sports, and other forms of entertainment.

System Compatibility: Interested vendors should respond via e-mail their capability statement/information to listed point of contacts. The capabilities statement/information should include as a minimum a detailed description of your service (including requirements/system compatibility, software and hardware maintenance/modification/upgrade requirements), catalog, brochure, business size (i.e., small business, large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.), and prices (including maintenance costs). All contractors must be FCC registered. Current service delivery infrastructure is not compatible with newer delivery technologies (i.e., satellite television). All responses must address overall infrastructure requirements, if applicable, and address conversion from the NTSC standard to the ATSC standard.

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: Online Introductory Overview Training for StEPS

The following Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for Market Research purposes in planning for the Secure Messaging Center solicitation.  It does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) by the Census Bureau.  The Census Bureau is not accepting offers at this time nor will the information provided be evaluated or considered as an offer.  This RFI does not commit the Census Bureau to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Census Bureau will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred by a contractor in response to this RFI.  

I.	Background and Synopsis of Requirement

This is a Request for Information (RFI) regarding a requirement to create online training that provides an introductory overview of the Standard Economics Processing System (StEPS). StEPS is a generalized data processing system which Census Bureau survey analysts primarily use to record, track, review, impute and correct data from economic survey programs. This document defines:

?	Characteristics of the Census Bureau employees and contractor staff who the target audience for this online training;
 
?	Skills/capabilities to be gained from the course;
 
?	Additional course requirements  
                   
II.	Description of StEPS 

StEPS is a generalized data processing system. Quinquennial, annual, quarterly, and monthly Census Bureau economic survey programs collect data from U.S.-based companies. Census Bureau survey analysts primarily use StEPS to record, track, review, impute and correct this data. 

StEPS is run separately for each survey on several server platforms, such as Unix, LINUX, and Blade. Survey specifications, known as ?parameters?, define each survey?s content.  For example, certain parameters define the items on a questionnaire, while others define the characteristics or a record ? such as company name and address.

Data is either hand keyed or imported electronically into StEPS.  The data for each survey within StEPS is stored in a standard SAS data set structure and survey items and variables are then stored as records within the data sets. This allows StEPS to accommodate variations among surveys. 

StEPS is also comprised of integrated modules. These enable users to check-in questionnaires,   edit data, update company mailing address and contact information, query data, and schedule company follow-up calls, among other tasks Point-and-click menus guide users through each modules. StEPS is updated quarterly to incorporate user enhancements, programming fixes, and new modules.

Survey users access StEPS from networked Census Bureau personal computers with a unique user-id and password combination.  The type of access account a user has depends on their role and the survey(s) he or she works on. All access to StEPS is within the Census Bureau security firewall. 

Because StEPS data is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act as well as potentially covered by the confidentially provisions of Title 13, Title 15, and/or other statutes and regulations, access is subject to all applicable departmental and bureau security policies.

III. Prospective Trainees

Trainees will be Census Bureau employees and contractor support employees. Most if not all have at least a four-year college degree or equivalent. They include:
            
?	New hires who have no experience with survey procedures or StEPS.
?	New users who are familiar with survey procedures in general, but have no experience with the survey area where they are now working or with StEPS.
?	Migration users who are experienced in the subject matter area, but have no StEPS experience.  Usually, this will be the case when a survey is migrating to StEPS.
?	Existing users who have StEPS experience, but require training on new functionality.
?	Programmers who will develop the StEPS programming code 

IV.	StEPS Online Overview Training Requirements

A.	Capabilities/Skills:

After finishing the training, the analysts/programmers must:

?	Understand the background and be familiar with the definition of StEPS.
?	Understand core StEPS functions and capabilities
?	Know common StEPS terminology
?	Know how to set up an account in StEPS
?	Be able to log on to StEPS and change record IDs, survey statistical periods, and other parameters 
?	Be able to use windows to navigate within StEPS, and understand the proper way to exit screens
?	Have a fundamental understanding of the major StEPS modules, including Review and Correction, Parameters, and Edits.
?	Understand the use of the pull-down menus and function keys used throughout StEPS. Know how to identify the different StEPS servers for production and development (i.e. EPBU10, EPBU01)
?	Understand StEPS data sets (item, c1, and control)
?	Understand StEPS data structures

B.	Other Requirements

StEPS training cannot interfere with production requirements. Actual survey data is protected by privacy and confidentiality requirements. This may imply a need for a separate training exercise database with fictional data.

Individual StEPS trainees will not receive a grade or pass or fail the training. However, we would like to have a means of assessing the overall effectiveness of the training in conveying the knowledge and capabilities outlined above.

Because StEPS is frequently modified, we will prefer a training module that can be easily updated by ?in-house? programmers.

The training shall be accessible from the trainee?s desktop computer over the Census Bureau network. The Census Bureau network is Windows-based and our personal computer operating system is Windows XP.

Because interruptions may occur, we would prefer that the trainee be able to interrupt the training module as needed and return to the last screen viewed when he or she returns to the training.

V.	Government-provided Resources: 

The training creator will have access to in-house Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and programmers for consultation regarding the training content and functions.

Information Requested:

The following information should be provided in response to this RFI:

?	Name and Address of the Company;

?	Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and email;

?	Provide any suggestions about requirements that the Census Bureau should consider for this project. Include any comments on the structure of the requirements, source selection process, performance matrix, and evaluation criteria, that you would deem appropriate for awarding this project. 
Response to this RFI should be submitted via e-mail to douglas.p.sefton@census.gov no later than February 12 , 2007 12:00 noon EST.  Submissions should be limited to MS Word, font size no smaller than 12-point pitch. Submitters are asked to limit their responses to the equivalent of 10 8.5 by 11 inch pages with one inch margins.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE. THIS IS A FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
REQUIREMENT. THE NAICS code is 326199. 

The Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management intends to award a contract for Tri-interface Java cards. This award will enable HHS to procure Personal Identification Verification (PIV)-compliant smart cards in accordance with (IAW) Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12).   The award is for one year with four option years.  HHS will make an initial purchase of 75,000 smart cards in the base year and will have the option to purchase up to 225,000 additional smart cards in the option years: a total ceiling of 300,000 smart cards.  These smart cards will be designed to meet the objectives of HSPD-12 and the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-1.  FIPS 201-1 defines the overall technical requirements and the foundation of the common identification standard of the PIV smart card. The ?tri-interface? PIV-compliant smart card is the only PIV-compliant smart card on the market today that meets the FIPS 201-1 PIV standard and the Department?s specific interoperability requirement for physical access and provides the capability to meet the future, mandatory 2048-bit encryption key handling and the functionality of JAVA containers for Global PIN Single Sign On (SSO) applets for logical access.  The HHS logical access control requirement calls for a Global PIN Single Sign On (SSO) applet only available with the Oberthur smart card. The smart cards must have passed the National Institutes of Technology (NIST) PIV certification and the offeror must be on the General Services Administration (GSA) approved HSPD-12 vendor list.

Engineering designs for construction of some proposed activities are currently being developed by the same firms. BOTH CDM AND MWH WILL BE ALLOWED TO COMPETE FOR, AND SUBMIT PRE-QUALIFICATION INFORMATION FOR THIS CMC CONTRACT.  Master Plan (MP) studies or Basis of Design Reports as well as other engineering designs will be made available to pre-qualified offerors .

The CMC's responsibilities shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following major items: developing  prequalification criteria, bid documents, and evaluation criteria or validate the same if earlier developed under other USAID funded efforts or the GOE and their counterparts; Perform feasibility studies of the small-scale construction activities described above and submit small-scale activities deemed feasible to USAID for approval of construction; Provide Final Designs, as needed, for construction activities which have been approved by USAID; Provide related complementary and supplementary support needed by the GOE Counterparts in the implementation of construction of approved small-scale activities including but not limited to the development of bid documents; Administer, inspect, and monitor all construction activities; Determine the capability and acceptability of subcontractors that may be proposed by the construction contractors; Ensure the development and implementation of a Facility Start-up Program; Process variation (change) orders; Oversight, on behalf of the employer, of the construction contractors to ensure progress of work in accordance with the terms of the construction contracts; Provide all construction management services relevant to completion of approved projects; Act as Employers "Engineer" in the administration of construction; Perform all CQC tasks to ensure all construction meets contract specifications; Monitor overall program budget and contract costs; Review and certify payment requests for interim and final payment submitted by the construction contractors; and Provide inspection services during the Defects Liability Period to verify acceptable completion of all work per contract specifications for proposed construction activities.
 
The CMC's responsibilities shall include reviewing, updating, and validating existing contracts, reports, analysis and other documentation such as environmental reviews or assessments, master plans, feasibility studies, and engineering designs. NOTE: Relevant documentation that will impact the work for which services are herein described will be provided to all pre-qualified firms that participate in this procurement.

N.B. The CMC's responsibilities shall also include work to close out the ongoing USAID-funded Water Improvement Project in Alexandria, and possibly, some minor work on other ongoing construction activities.  In particular, CMCs responsibilities will include the provision of inspection services during the Defects Liability Period of the Alexandria Water Improvement construction contract, to verify acceptable completion of all work per contract specifications for proposed construction activities, and subsequently, assistance with close-out of the contract. Minor assistance on other contracts, such as supervision of final testing, certification and contract close-out, may be required, as directed by USAID. 

A cost plus fixed fee, type contract is contemplated to be awarded.  The expected duration of the contract is three years with the possibility of granting contract extension(s) believed necessary for completion and closing out of all activities or undertaking additional activities required to successfully achieve the objective and results of the construction program. Issuance of this request does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the Government nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation or submission of any information.  It is a requirement that the firms must comply with USAID geographic code 000 (USA) for nationality and source regulations.

Consulting engineering firms are expected to demonstrate the following, which will be used for evaluating firm qualifications: (A) Applicable international experience and capability to provide the required experienced personnel to implement the work, (B) Organizational capacity and financial resources, (C) Similar services and work experience.  Experience in the Middle East and/or Egypt and/or similar developing country environment is desirable.  USAID requests that interested consulting engineering firms submit six copies of completed US Government Standard Form SF 330 Architect-engineer Qualifications, Part II (general Qualifications) and SF330 Part I (contract specific qualifications).  Those forms can be found at http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF .  It is anticipated that the selected consultant will sign a direct contract with USAID to provide services subject to the availability of funds.  The firm's current financial statement and an affirmative statement that the firm can meet USAID nationality and source regulations must be submitted.  Copies of interested firm's brochures and annual report may also be of value in presenting the firms qualification.

The completed pre-qualification information and related statements must be received no later than January 17, 2006, 3:30 PM Cairo time, at the following address.  Additional information submitted after that date may be rejected by USAID.  Submit pre-qualification forms to the following address: Mr. John May, Contracting Officer, Office of Procurement, United States Agency for International Development, USAID/Egypt, 1 Ahmed Kamel Street, New Maadi 11435, Cairo Egypt.  If sent by U.S. mail: Mr. John May, Contracting Officer, Office of Procurement, USAID Unit 64902, APO AE 09839-4902.

No RFP will be issued.  Consulting engineering firms will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria found in the AID Acquisition Regulations, Part 736.602-3 (B) and their assigned relative weights as follows: ((1) Specialized experience of the firm with the type of service required (15%), (2) Capacity of the firm to perform the work within the time limitations (10%), (3) Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules (20%), (4) Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel from the organization, including a competent supervising representative having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a similar nature (15%), (5) The portions of the work the architect-engineer is able to perform with its own forces when required (5%), (6) Ability of the architect-engineer to furnish or to obtain required materials and equipment (5%), (7) Familiarity with the localities where the projects are situated (15%), (8) Financial capacity (10%), (9) Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards provided in FAR subpart 9.1. (Pass/Fail), (10) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the USAID, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of architect-engineer contracts among qualified firms (5%).

USAID will establish a short list of at least three qualified firms as per FAR part 36.602-3(C).  USAID will provide the draft statement of work, a list of questions to be addressed and evaluation criteria to the short listed firms for purposes of holding discussions and/or presentations.  After the final selection of the most qualified firm to perform the work, USAID will request a cost proposal from, and will negotiate with, this top ranked firm.  If a satisfactory contract cannot be concluded, USAID may negotiate with the next ranked firm."

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) encourages the participation to the maximum extent possible of local Engineering Firms and local talents, small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women -owned business concerns in this activity as prime contractors or subcontractors in accordance with Part 19 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  In this respect, it is anticipated that the prime contractor will make every reasonable effort to identify and, make maximum practicable use of such concerns.  All other selection evaluation criteria being found equal, the participation of such concerns may become a determining factor for selection.

USCG HU-25 DASSAULT FALCON JET EXTERNAL AIRCRAFT PAINT, PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT


1.0	   BACKGROUND:

The USCG operates twenty Falcon HU-25 aircraft.  Until recently these aircraft have been externally stripped and painted at the USCG?s Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) following the completion of a required five year Programmed Depot Maintenance Inspection (PDM).  Aircraft painted at ARSC experience paint adhesion discrepancies shortly after delivery to USCG operational units.  Poor paint adhesion contributes to increased field level maintenance and aircraft corrosion if left untreated.  These discrepancies can be attributed to the limited environmental controls of the current paint facility.  In an effort to improve performance, reduce corrosion and field maintenance cost the USCG intends to establish a long term commercial paint contract for its fleet of HU-25 aircraft whose anticipated retirement date is 2015.  This solicitation establishes the minimum external paint requirements.  


NOTES: A reduction in fleet size may occur by fiscal year 2008.  All aircraft will be stripped 
                by ARSC during PDM using corn starch blast media. 

                The USCG is also in the process of procuring one type of paint system for all aircraft.  
                The contractor must be able to adjust to the new system to be used.  


2.0	  OBJECTIVE:
            
      The USCG?s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center with an onsite paint facility. The contractor shall provide all services necessary to prepare and externally paint HU-25 aircraft in accordance with (IAW) best commercial practices, the paint manufacturer?s recommended procedures and the general scope work.  Dassault Falcon Jet, Plaisir, France is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).  The general scope of work is as follows:

2.1	 Pre-paint surface preparation IAW best commercial specifications.  Contractor to identify       specification in the quote.

Note:  Areas of the aircraft that is covered and inaccessible after assembly of the aircraft; such as flight control surface leading edges (flaps, slats, slat upper fixed boxes, ailerons, rudder, & elevators), horizontal/vertical stabilizer attachment points, box structures and cavities were painted during the interim paint phase of the PDM evolutions.  Flight controls do not require removal.  Previously painted areas shall be inspected for adhesion, scuff sanded and top coated to insure a color match.

2.2	 Inspect seam sealants and reseal as necessary.  Do not use hard permanent type fillers on  
       faying joints, all removable inspection panel seams, wing root seams or wing tip caps.  Use  
       Polysulfide sealants meeting MIL-PRF-81733, AMS-S-8802 or PR-1422

2.3	 Prime, paint and stencil the aircraft?s exterior surfaces IAW USCG ARSC Drawings 925-139 (HU-25 Paint and Detail Markings), Revision J, dated 11/16/06, 925-139-1 (HU-25 Paint Markings, Stencil and Decal package), Revision C, dated 07/10/06 and paint manufacturer?s recommended procedures.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

I. Introduction
The Program Office (PO) of the Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E) directs the strategic planning, analysis, budget planning, program performance and evaluation processes for the 24 active country programs in the E&E region.  E&E/PO also has responsibility for ensuring that the E&E Bureau addresses key Administration and Congressional priorities and responds to USAID policy and program issues.  The Program office is composed of two divisions: (a) Strategic Planning and Analysis (SPA), and (b) Project Development and Budget Planning.  In FY 2005, E&E/PO supported management of $395 million in Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltic States (AEEB) and $565 million in Freedom Support Act (FSA) funds for the former Soviet Union.  

When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union collapsed in late 1991, the Europe and Eurasia region became a new frontier for the United States Government.  The Congress responded by authoring the Support for East European Democracy (SEED) Act of 1989 and the Freedom for Russia and Emerging Eurasian Democracies and Open Markets (FREEDOM) Support Act (FSA) of 1992.  From the inception of these acts, USAID has been the main federal agency managing programs to promote democracy and human rights, to introduce and institutionalize a market economy, and to alleviate the social and humanitarian problems in the former communist states of Europe and Eurasia.  USAIDs underlying objectives in Europe and Eurasia have been and continue to be freedom, peace, prosperity, and regional stability. USAID, through its Bureau for Europe and Eurasia (E&E), provides oversight of a comprehensive program of assistance to the states of the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe.  The purpose of the assistance program is to promote the successful transition from communist rule to the establishment of market-oriented democracies with responsible social safety nets. 

The position is to be encumbered in the Strategic Planning and Analysis (SPA) division of the E&E Program office. The SPA Division is responsible for: 1) leading the development of the E&E Bureaus strategic framework, sector plans and analytical agenda; 2) collaboration with the Department of State's Office of the Coordinator of U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia (EUR/ACE) in overseeing Inter-Agency Country Assistance Reviews (ICAR), pre-strategy consultations, Mission Strategy Statement submissions and close out plan reviews,  3) preparation of written and oral Congressional testimony, and other Bureau-wide reporting, and 4) E&E Bureau representation in agency-wide initiatives on such matters as fragile states, counter-terrorism, military affairs, conflict mitigation management, donor coordination and the Millennium Challenge Account.   The SPA division also, as required, provides direct assistance to E&E missions through temporary duty (TDY) travel to the field.

The incumbent will require skills in analysis and monitoring of economic, social, and political conditions existing in the E&E region.  These skills are particularly important in organizing agency-wide reviews of Bureau and Mission policies and strategies for assistance, for designing programs that will advance that strategy, for learning from experience in program implementation, and for informing the graduation process.  Such analysis and monitoring will enhance the capacity of the Program Office to shape and articulate the Bureaus collective vision, influence its participation in agency wide initiatives, and expand support for field operations. 

II. Duties and Responsibilities
The incumbent will provide a multi-disciplinary approach to monitoring and interpreting socio-political conditions in the region and assessing issues for program analysis and approval processes, preparation of Bureau-wide reporting, and E&E Bureau representation in agency-wide initiatives.  The incumbent will analyze and evaluate strategic aspects of country programs managed by field missions in the E&E region, and will direct the review and approval process on behalf of USAID/Washington for country-level assistance strategies.  

The incumbent will coordinate his/her work with:  each of the E&E Bureau technical offices, agency pillar bureaus, and the Department of State's Office of the Coordinator responsible for oversight of USAIDs assistance activities in Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia; with the country affairs or Desk offices which track development programs in the target countries; and with the USAID missions serving those countries.

The incumbent will be expected to prepare a range of analyses, decision memoranda, and reporting to the E&E Bureau front office and to organizations with oversight responsibility for US foreign assistance, including the Congress, OMB, and the Department of State. 

III. Statement of Work
Under the supervision of the SPA Division Chief and with guidance from the Director of E&Es Program Office, the incumbent will:

Strategies and Reviews:
	In consultation with E&E technical offices, USAID pillar bureaus, and the State Department Coordinator for FSA and SEED, lead the strategy consultative processes for assigned Mission pre-strategy and strategy reviews, budget reviews, phase-out reviews, close-out plans, and other E&E Bureau-chaired reviews as necessary.  Review proposed assistance strategies and recommend approval or changes by taking into account the economic state of the country, political and social conditions, development plans, ands programs and priorities of other donors.  The incumbent also considers U.S. foreign policy objectives, legislative requirements, and USAID strategy. 
	For pre-strategy consultations, this will require soliciting issues from a wide range of stakeholders; determining which issues are most critical for shaping the overall assistance strategic direction; and facilitating a compromise on points of disagreement between the field and Washington offices both during the consultations and in the course of preparing the parameters cable that provides guidance to the mission for development of their strategy statement.  
	For approval of Mission strategy statements, the incumbent will similarly seek comments from the wide range of stakeholders; determine which comments require revisions to the strategy and suggest means of modifying the strategy statement to reconcile differences in perspective.   In determining how to reconcile difference in perspective, the incumbent will consider empirical data and qualitative assessments on country performance, consultation with other USAID and Department of State offices, and reference to applicable USAID regulations governing the review and approval of mission strategy statements.  
	Manage a process for finalizing approval of assigned sector strategies that will include one or more of the following: health, democracy, social transition, market transition, and infrastructure and energy.  Similar to the process for managing approval of mission strategies, this will require soliciting issues, facilitating resolution of disagreements, and documenting decisions made to assist technical offices within the E&E Bureau finalize sector strategies intended to help guide Mission programming.
	He or she will also represent the E&E Bureau at the Inter-Agency Country Assistance Reviews (ICAR) chaired by the Department of State and conducted in the field. Each of these tasks entails wide latitude of independent judgment in determining appropriate guidance to resolve differences in perspective between the field and the AID/W or State Department office sponsoring an issue for consideration.

Bureau Analytical Agenda:
	The E&E Bureau Analytical Agenda encompasses both empirical and qualitative research relevant to program decision-making.  The incumbent will identify possible topics for the agenda.  As needed, develop scopes of work for empirical analyses or sector assessments.  Oversee the implementation of specific studies and disseminate findings in a manner relevant to the E&E bureau and field missions.

Country-Specific Tasks:
	The incumbent will be assigned one or more countries to backstop.  This will entail gaining a detailed understanding of country performance, program accomplishments and challenges, and strategic direction and budget decision-making.  This expertise will strengthen E&E Bureau strategic planning, oversight capacity, deepen support for field missions, and facilitate the compilation of lessons learned for wider application. 
	Develop and/or review country-specific information related to various bureau and Agency documents (e.g. Budget Justification Documents to Congress, FSA or SEED reports, Bureau Program Budget Submission, etc.).
	Monitor, identify, and report on country and regional performance trends.

Other:
	Develop and maintain relationships with various stakeholders in USAID and other Federal agencies.  Actively participate in policy formulation discussions and conduct liaison activities and briefings on E&E strategy and programs.   
	Support E&E understanding of, participation in and strategic response to agency-wide cross-cutting initiatives, such as the emerging discipline of security and development and the increased role of development assistance in counter-terrorism and military affairs.
	Undertake special assignments or respond to intermittent work requirements identified by the Director of E&Es Program Office, his/her designee, or other Bureau Senior Management.
	Develop a variety of documents ranging from the Bureau Budget Justification Document, the Bureau Program Budget Submission, Congressional testimony, speeches for the AA/E&E and DAAs/E&E, etc.
	Gather data from E&E technical offices and Missions for E&Es submission to USAIDs Performance and Accountability Report (PAR), OMBs Performance and Accountability Rating Tool (PART), and other USAID performance reports. 

IV. Decision Making
The incumbent will be a Senior Program Advisor that is considered an expert that has been consulted by other experts and who can perform under general administrative discretion with wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment, work of outstanding difficulty and responsibility; and has formal decision making authority in broad area of democratic governance and conflict related strategic programming choices. 

V. Level of Complexity
Tracking country specific and regional trends and integrating that information into strategic directions for the E&E Bureau entails a highly complex assignment. The incumbent will collect information from a variety of sources, interpret it and represent the Bureau in high level meetings in order to convey the basis of Bureau strategy to those inside and outside of the Bureau. Developments in the E&E region in the fields of democracy and conflict mitigation are extremely dynamic and require excellent understanding of different methodological approaches as well as fine judgment and analysis as to their levels of importance in regard to USAID programs and the interests of the US Government as a whole.  

VI. Knowledge Level Required
The position demands mastery of democracy and conflict related programming but assignments are complicated by interconnected issues, multi-disciplinary approaches, conflicts among possible technical solutions, etc.     It is desirable that the incumbent possess the following:

	Comprehensive knowledge of USAIDs country program strategy and planning systems, as well as a thorough working knowledge of the Agencys project design and implementation systems.
	Thorough working knowledge of U.S. foreign aid legislation and trends and Executive Branch policies and directions.
	Broad knowledge of relevant economic and social issues of the transition countries
	Solid knowledge of USAID management systems and administrative procedures.
	Ability to apply experimental theories and new developments to problems not susceptible to accepted methods

VII. Supervisory Controls  
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the Chief of the Strategic Planning and Analysis Division as well as the Director of E&Es Program Office. The incumbents supervisors provide general direction and broad guidance pertaining to the analytical agenda of the E&E Bureau. The supervisor informally follows work progress and reviews it for fulfillment of Bureau priorities, objectives and overall goals, as well as for consistency and conformance to Agency policy. The incumbent independently plans, designs and carries out projects, studies and programs. There is no higher level official technically responsible for conducting these types of analyses or for providing related technical program guidance to the missions.

VIII. Guidelines
Broad guidelines include the Freedom Support and SEED Acts; Foreign Assistance Act as amended; appropriation acts; report parameters as set by the State Department Coordinators Office (in particular, the country phase-out guidelines); and USAID directives and policies.  In addition, various Agency strategies that will help guide analysis include the Fragile States Strategy, the Anticorruption Strategy, the White Paper, and the E&E Anticorruption Framework TAPEE. However, the incumbent will be required to use judgment and ingenuity to interpret the intent of the guidelines and to develop professional and expert analyses and strategic inputs. 

IX. Complexity of Work Environment
Work is performed in a typical office setting.  The incumbent will be required occasionally to undertake short to medium duration international travel to locations within the E&E Bureau geographical area that may entail some physical hardships. Because of the need for quick response and creativity in complex situations, the incumbent is expected to operate with autonomy, responsibility and authority. The sensitive nature of the work demands that the incumbent be an individual with good skills of social interaction and a skilled interpreter of politically charged situations.     Since work may require continued changes in program direction, implementation and coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.

X. Scope and Effect of Work
Assignments reflect wide program area; projects range from regional to national, impacting areas that an individual with high level managerial and operational skills can handle, and the incumbent must be available to be sent out quickly to perform specific advisory functions in the field. The incumbent will be involved in critical program activity for measuring and assessing the impact of USAID activities throughout the E&E region. Information and analysis is also used for developing briefing materials for senior Bureau officials, assisting with responses to congressional inquiries, and providing information outside the Bureau.    

Bureau analysis and input are critical to Congress and the Coordinator Offices in State Department who oversee development activities in the geographical region. The incumbent is recognized as an expert on the region to other similar experts and his/her work affects the work of other experts.     Providing effective program/project strategies for the range of countries in the E&E region establishes the basis for self-sustaining activities in the recipient region, thereby positively affecting the living conditions and well-being of a substantial number of people.

XI. Level and Purpose of Contacts
Given the central and coordinating role of the Program Office in the development of strategies in the region, the incumbent will be expected to collaborate with a wide range of senior management officials, within USAID (within E&E as well as other Bureaus, pillar and geographic bureaus; in Washington and in the field) and within the USG community more broadly (in the State Department primarily) and among other donors and organizations.  These contacts and collaboration are needed to ensure coordination and synergies among USAID programs in the region and with other key players in the foreign aid community.  The overall purpose of contact is to influence, motivate, control or direct people or groups to reach a consensus on the resolution of issues at high levels, both inside and outside the Agency; employ appropriate approaches for negotiating with and persuading others regarding difficult and strategic DG program decisions; determine the appropriateness and effectiveness of USAID assistance in the Missions; develop complimentarity among donors in assistance efforts; provide guidance on program design and implementation and provide briefings on the status of programs.


XIII. Supervision/Oversight of Others
The incumbent will not have supervisory responsibilities.

XIV. Minimum Qualification Requirements

Education
	A masters degree in the fields of international development, social sciences or equivalent.


Relevant Work Experience
	A minimum of six (6) years of professional experience and project management in international development
	Experience working on problems of democratic and market transitions in the Europe/Eurasia region

XV. Selective Evaluation Factors

	30 points -- Experience working and communicating with US foreign policy agencies, American embassies, or related NGOs, overseas to achieve critical, high profile objectives 
	30 points -- Experience designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating foreign assistance programs
	20 points -- Experience operating independently in complex political situations in pre/post-conflict countries or countries undergoing political transitions 
	20 points  Excellent writing and interpersonal communication experience and skills, demonstrating an ability to foster E&E Bureau relationships with key partners, stakeholders and beneficiaries both within and without the USG, and in multi-disciplinary teams from all walks of life and varying geographic and political environments

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Q2.  For clarification purposes, the requirement is for every 911 call to first ring a phone at the corresponding Security Office at each of the five locations.  It is then the decision of the Security Personnel to either handle the call or transfer the calling party to the local 911 Center (Public Safety Answering Point).  Is this a true assessment? Typically we deliver the 911 call to security and the local PSAP simultaneously since time is of the essence.  If not, please explain desired 911 Call Routing: 

A2. A 911 call from a remote location should be routed to its corresponding Security Office. Those Security Personnel will make the decision to handle the call or allow the call to proceed to the local PSAP. The call should also be simultaneously routed to the HQ Lobby Security Desk in order for the Security Personnel to monitor and record the calls and notify appropriate HQ personnel. 911 calls at HQ will be routed to the HQ Lobby Security Desk where Security Personnel will decide to handle the call or allow the call to proceed to the local PSAP. 

 
Q3. Does each of the five locations have National Standard ISDN PRI circuits available for 911 call routing/delivery? 

A3. All call processing is done by the HQ PBX and calls delivered/received to/from the remote locations via data T1?s. All calls in and out of HQ PBX from Public Switched Network (PSN) are via ISDN PRI circuits.

 
Q4. Who is your servicing telco that provides PS/ALI services? 

A4. Verizon
 
Q5. Other than the Security Departments, are there any other agencies at any location that require real-time notification (via computer terminal) of 911 call events? 

A5. No
 
Q6. Are the five locations networked together for internal dialing purposes?  If so, explain network connectivity between PBX?s. 

A6.It is not a data network, the remote IPE modules are connected back to the HQ PBX via 3 data T1?s from each site.
 
Q7. On a 911 call set-up, can the originating station number be passed from one PBX    to another (i.e. routing 911 calls to one main PBX for call handling)?

A7. There is only 1 PBX ? at HQ. The sites are tied in with remote modules.


Q8. Model and version is the FEMA HQ PBX?

A8. Nortel Meridian M1 running Succession 4.5.

Q9.Is Virginia site is serviced via the same 911 tandem as the Washington, DC sites?

A9. Yes, the remote module is tied to HQ PBX via 3 data T1?s.

Q10. Is there an incumbent of this procurement opportunity?  If so, I would greatly appreciate the following: contractors name, contract number, date, expiration date and value. 

A10. No

Q11. Is there a required headcount number for this project? 

A11. 3200

Q12. Is there a requirement for the work to be performed at a FEMA building location, or can it be performed at another site within the United States?

A12. Yes

Q13.  What are the manufacturers of the PBXs/Telephone systems serving each of the five locations noted in the solicitations?

A13. See answer for Q1.

Q14. If any of the telephone systems serving the five noted locations also support remote site, please identify the number and locations of the remote sites.
 
A14. N/A

Q15. Are the telephone systems serving the five noted sites networked together?  If so, please describe the network configuration and the network infrastructure.

A15. See answer to Q6.

Q16.  Are any of the telephone instruments which are to be supported by the Emergency Call Management System VoIP instruments?  If so, at which site are they located and how many at each site? 

A16. No

Q16.Please identify the Public Service Answering Points (PSAPs) serving each of the five noted locations.  Are these PSAPs networked?  If so, please provide a description of the network configuration.
 
A16. Information provided upon award of contract.

Q17. Will FEMA answer the E911 calls using their own staff or do they just want to be able to monitor and audit the incoming calls. 

A17. See answer to Q2.
