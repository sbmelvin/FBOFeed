Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE.

D.	AFTER THE DPE  1.	Closing Price Discussions. Discussions concerning price shall normally conclude at the close of the DPE. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be award ed the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation. 3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

Recent project experience documenting innovative compliance strategies should be included. 
(2) Professional qualifications and capabilities of the staff to be assigned to this project.  Complete one Section E (Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for this contract) of the SF 330 – Architect Engineer Qualifications for each key person who will participate in this contract.  Group by firm, with personnel of the prime contractor or joint venture partner firms first.  Key Persons are individuals who will have major contract responsibilities and/or provide unusual or unique expertise.

The following are minimum salient characteristics: The SyTech SR-3001 Command Post Radio InterOperability System allows for the ability to communicate between any types of dis-similar radios or telephones. Included within the base SR-3001 are one VHF, and UHF radios, cellular phone and landline connection. The radios allow comms between most VHF and UHF radios. The landline and cellular phones will allow for the real time and seamless comms between radios and telephones. The comms between the radios is controlled through the use of a PC computer and SyTech designed and developed software. The software is used to set up of comms links between the radios and phones. Once the comms "links" are configured the system does not need to be manned. The main computer functions both as the database and recorder server. Additional PC's can be connected via a 100 Mbps LAN as client stations. These client stations have the full and complete suite of software interface screens to allow for the control of the comms.  As audio from the comms is being recorded, the radio controller may also view the Radio Data (e.g. Caller I.D., start time, duration, etc.). Audio is recorded immediately to the archive media, magneto optical or DVD. Available to the radio operator is the full suite of the Advanced Digital and Analog Collection (ADACS) analysis software. After the call has ended, the operator may play back the call and use MS Word to provide a complete transcription of the recorded call. The playback audio is displayed as a frequency spectrum. This frequency spectrum allows the user to identify speakers or allows for forensic analysis. A remote computer may be connected to the system through  the use of high speed WAN's or Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines. This remote computer has the full capabilities of the Command Post computer station. The system is fully compliant with all police, fire and EMS radio comms. A report writer generator allows for the automatic creation of the any reports required by Police or Fire Departments. For example, Traffic Reports and Individual User Reports are fully automated.

 The graphical user interface (GUI) for the SR-3001, provides a display of the radio interconnects. Shown at the top of the display are the radios, phones, and computers that are available to be interconnected. At the bottom of the display are the functions that are available to the user. In order to perform any of the available functions, the user simply touches (touch screen) or places the pointer on the function and clicks the mouse. After selecting the function the user selects the items to be interconnected at the top of the display. Upon selecting the items, the system software will place the items on the screen showing the ICONs as connected. For example, if the user wants to create a Talk Group, the user touches the TG ICON at the bottom of the display and touches the items to be connected, from the top of the screen. As the items are selected they are displayed on the monitor screen. After selecting the items to be connected the user simply touches the connect ICON and the items are ready for operation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Description

The purpose of this Modification #02 is to add the requirement for the origin (country of manufacture) of the products and to post questions and answers related to this procurement. The Authorized Geographic Codes for this contract are 000 (United States) and 110 (New Independent States - independent countries of the former Soviet Union). If a 000 or 110-origin product is not available, the offeror must provide an explanation and request a waiver in accordance with 22CFR 228.51; (this Federal Regulation may be found at the following link: http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/22cfr228_01.html). There is no prescribed format or form for the waiver request. Question 1. The Thermal Cycler offered in our quotation seems to meet all of the specifications you list below.  It has gradient temperature capability, maximum gradient is 30°C over gradient range 20-70°C.  Accuracy is +-0.3°C as specified. Ramping rate is 3.0°C/second, which exceeds the specification.  Temp. range is 4° to 99°C as specified.  Are you confirming that our offer for this item meets your needs, or suggesting that we should change to a different model?  Answer: No changes are needed. Question 2. The unit we bid for the Thermal Block (FTC3102D) meet or exceed all the specifications listed below, with the exception of the programming. Our unit has space for 80 programs, you have requested space for 100 programs. Answer:  80 programs is OK. Question 3. Your specifications for the Thermal Block match closely to a discontinued model by Barnstead/Lab-Line, the PTB-214. From what I understand, Thermal Blocks technology was replaced with Thermal Cycler technology. If you have preferences toward particular units for the above two items, please let me know the model and I can bid against that. Otherwise I will let the quote stand for these two items. I have found a less expensive PCR Bench Top Hood - No Laminar Flow.  The 115V version of this unit can be seen on website, searching with catalog number. This is ordered as 220V at no additional charge. Answer:  OK. Question 4. PCR Bench Top Hood: 1st hood bid requirement states "no-ducting and laminar air flow". 2nd hood bid requirement states "no-ducting and           no-laminar air flow". Please,       clarify if these specifications should be the same - or, as stated, different? Any size limitations? Answer: They should be the same; 24in. x 24-28in. x 30-32in would be OK. Question 5. Vortex: What speed range? Should both an automatic and a manual touch control be included or just one type? Which type, if only one? Answer: 3,000 rpm with both an automatic and a manual touch control. Question 6. Clock: What size should the digital numbers be - 2.5cm, 5.0cm, etc? Answer: 5.0 cm. Question 7. Ice Cube, Maker: What type of ice -  flake, nugget, cubes, etc? Answer: Flake. How much ice should be made per hour? Answer: 3-5 liters per hour. Capacity of storage container? Answer: 30-50 liters. Should the unit be self-contained or modular style?  Answer: Unit can be self-contained or modular style. Question 8. Thermometer: What is the range and what graduation intervals? Answer: General purpose thermometer, 0-100°C, 1°C interval. Question 9. We have assumed that a Mini Gel-O-Submarine name mean the chamber for electrophoresis. But we do not know what horizontal or vertical gel unit it is necessary. Answer: Horizontal gel unit. Question 10. Can you specify what length of a wave is required for a fluorescent light for hoods? Answer: General purpose light for good workspace illumination, white light, plus UV 254 nm. [End of Modification]

<DESC>Statement of Work:
The Prepositioned Equipment Program

1.  Introduction.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  These tasks UNDER THIS sow are the logical extension of the Prepositioned Emergency Response Equipment Study and are intended to continue execution and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for First Responders on behalf of Wackenhut Services Inc.

2.  Background.  In the FY 2001 Appropriations Bill for Justice, the Joint Conference report indicated that the Appropriations Committee was aware of unfunded requirements for equipping State and local emergency first responders to deal with a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorist incident.  The Committee directed the creation of a Federal prepositioned equipment program to sustain State and local first responders.

To develop the concept for an effective prepositioned equipment program for emergency first responders, the Department of Justice Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (since renamed the Office for Domestic Preparedness and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security) formed a study team and an advisory working group comprising select senior emergency responder subject matter experts from major metropolitan areas across the country.  Five sub-groups, Command and Control, Equipment, Logistics, Medical, and Federal Partners, each led by an experienced member of the emergency response community, focused on key aspects of the concept.  Sub-panels prepared draft concepts for defining the PEP program within their functional area of responsibility.  The study team integrated the findings and recommendations of the sub-panels to provide an integrated baseline approach for the program.  This effort resulted in the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress. 

The Report to Congress constituted Phase I in the development of the PEP program for the First Responders.  Subsequent Phases focus on the implementation and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP).

3.	Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  

4.	Objectives and Scope.  This SOW has the following objectives: 1) to provide administrative support to sustain the PEP program, 2) to develop, implement and sustain the information technology support required to support the program.   In addition, office space for the Wackenhut Program Coordinator and Facility Manager will be provided by the successful bidder. 

5.	Accomplishments.  Two pivotal accomplishments guide this project:

·	the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress, and,

·	the WMD Prepositioned Program (PEP) Operations Manual has been written and is awaiting publication by the Department of Homeland Security.

6.   Methodology.  Provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP program through the integration with other complimentary activities and closely coordinate with key interagency participants in the national approach to the WMD terrorist threat.   

7.  Subtasks.  This SOW consists of four tasks.  Specific tasks are as follows:

Subtask 1 – DEVELOP PLANS AND STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEP

Develop, as directed by WSI, plans and procedures that will ensure the timely and efficient implementation of the PEP program and will continually refine these plans and procedures as experience with the program identifies improved operational methods.  These plans and procedures shall include provisions for guidance in the functional areas of: facilities management, safety, security, training, Information Technology (IT), and program management support.   

Functions shall include: 

·	conduct background research, data collection, and liaison with stakeholder Federal, State, and local government agencies and commercial partners to support the development of plans and SOPs;
·	validate plans and SOPs through Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) or other forums such as limited gaming events or exercises;
·	facilitate meetings of the PEP working group: prepare agenda, arrange accommodations, develop briefing materials, and prepare minutes of the proceedings; 
·	provide IT support such as desk top publishing; and,
·	prepare documentation.

Potential products could be manuals and SOPs, monthly reports and working group meeting support.

Subtask 2 – COORDINATING EXECUTION OF SELECT PEP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

Field a PEP capability that will provide federal support to State and local WMD emergency first responders.  This capability includes pre-positioned equipment that is prepared for delivery, where / when needed, and as directed by the cognizant federal authority.  Funchtions shall include:
·	coordinate PEP data collection to ensure the adequacy of the inventory, i.e., quantity, packaging, materiel management and planned transportation of the PEP materiel.  This information will facilitate the efficient expenditure of resources when procuring the remaining PEP Pods; and,
·	adequate IT for materiel management of the prepositioned equipment.

Potential products include the review / update of plans and SOPs.
 
Subtask 3 – PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FOR THE PEP STORAGE SITES NATIONWIDE. 

	Coordinate the required hardware, software 
and  internet connections to maximize the efficient operation of the various storage sites.  This task will also involve the development, and maintenance of a PEP web site.  Functions shall include:

survey 	each site to determine the most cost effective approach to implement a local area network and to connect the site to the internet;

coordinate the installation of telephone and high speed internet connectivity through the WSI, General Services Administration telephone point of contact;

coordinate the procurement of hardware specific to the requirements at each site through the Marine Corps Systems Command PEP Prime Vendor point of contact;

install the hardware and test the operability of the local area network and the internet connection.

This task will ensure continued and effective utilization of resources through oversight of an integrated training and exercise program.  All PEP training will utilize the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium and other national resources.  The lead for PEP training has been assigned to the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) and the National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center (NERRTC) of Texas A&M.  The training will entail the processes involved in requesting, deploying, receiving, and retrograding Pods from their storage sites.  

The successful bidder will perform activities that could include:

·	coordinate the development of exercise scenarios and processes for use in training federal, state and local government agencies, and commercial partners in the processes necessary to effectively deploy the WMD PEP program capability;

·	participate in training exercises for Federal, State, and local government agencies, commercial partners and PEP support teams to validate processes for continued use during the periodic training required over the life of the PEP program.  These exercises will likely be conducted in conjunction with ongoing activities such as the support provided for National Special Security Events.

Potential products include coordinated plans for training and exercises and summary reports of exercise observations and recommendations.

The Contractor will generate all appropriate shipping documentation and obtain a signature from 22 CES Environmental Flight personnel acknowledging the shipment.  The returned material will be packaged in the original 55-gallon steel drums it was shipped in.  All PM will be sealed in 55-gallon steel drums and secured to pallets by plastic or metal banding or shrink wrap.  The returned PM will contain PM, no more than 10% glass media, paint residue and bag house dust.  It will be free of liquids, greases, petroleum products, trash, wood, paper, garbage, or other foreign or radioactive material (collectively called “Unacceptable Contaminates”).  Unless the Contractor notifies MAFB personnel in writing within ten (10) days upon receipt of used PM by the Contractor, the returned PM will be deemed acceptable.  Used PM returned to the Contractor which contains Unacceptable Contaminates, may, at the Contractor’s election after notification to MAFB, be returned to MAFB at the Government’s expense and risk.  The Government will save, hold harmless, and indemnify the Contractor for any and all claims, liabilities, or damages arising out of shipment of used PM containing Unacceptable Contaminates.  The recycling of the PM and manufacture of products from the spent bead blast shall be done within the United States of America.

8.	The Contractor, by way of this Agreement, contracts, warrants, represents and agrees that all returned used PM (the secondary material) will be recycled as defined under 40 CFR 261 and 262, Resource Conversation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and other applicable Federal and State regulations governing the handling, disposition, or recycling of materials, and that the final product manufactured in recycling will be non-hazardous, non-toxic and commercially salable.  The  contractor will save, hold harmless, and indemnify the Government for any and all claims, liabilities, or damages arising from present or future use of the final manufactured product or future disposal of the final manufactured product. 

9.	EXCESS RETURN.  In the event that the quantity of material returned to the Contractor exceeds the quantity shipped to MAFB by the Contractor under this Agreement, then the Contractor, at its option, may elect to accept this overage, in which case it will notify MAFB in writing of the quantity and that quantity, multiplied by an amount per pound agreed upon by both parties termed “Excess Return Price”, will be invoiced to and paid by MAFB.  At the inception of this Agreement, if MAFB has used PM on hand which could qualify for recycling, whether manufactured by the Contractor or not, the Contractor may elect, at its option, to take that material at the Excess Return Price per pound.  The Excess Return Price includes freight.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR the SCOUT PROJECT.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to: 1) Post the questions and answers that were submitted for the SCOUT Project Procurement, 2) Clarify the Evaluation Criteria, and 3) Provide an updated SOW, changes are annotated by underline and bold. 1) In the synopsis/solicitation  it states "at least 8kW at a minimum of 48V". Section 2.2.1 of the Statement of Work states "at least 8kW at a maximum of 48V". Please clarify if the 48V is a minimum or maximum voltage.  ANSWER: The fuel cell shall be capable of producing at least 8 kW at a minimum of 48VDC.	 The SOW has been changed to reflect this.    2) Is the voltage and power specification (48V at 8kW) for operation on hydrogen and oxygen or on methane reformate and oxygen.  ANSWER: The preference for this fuel cell procurement is for reliable operation with hydrogen and oxygen.   3) What type of contract is envisioned to be awarded under this solicitation, cost plus fixed fee or firm fixed price?   ANSWER: The contract type for this procurement will be firm fixed price.  4) What is the composition of the reformate that will eventually be used in the fuel cell stack?	ANSWER: The reformate anticipated will contain no more than 10 ppm of CO and no more than 100 ppm of CH4 and CO2 (combined).  If the fuel cell cannot tolerate these levels of CO2 and CH4, the vendor should state this in the quotation, as additional components can be added to the powerplant to remove additional CO2 + CH4.  The 10 ppm of CO is a maximum level of CO that cannot be changed.  The fuel cell must be capable of tolerating 10 ppm of CO.  5) In the 2nd sentence of section 2.1.1.6 it states that the stack shall include the instrumentation to adequately monitor...   Does the term "instrumentation" in this case mean just the thrermocouples and voltage pickups for the cells or is something else required? ANSWER: The term instrumentation refers to the required thermocouples and individual cell voltage connectors and any other instrumentation that would be necessary (based on the fuel cell vendor requirements) to monitor the fuel cell health and performance.   6) What is the intended purpose and location for the requested internal thermocouples? ANSWER:  The intended purpose of the goal for at least five internal thermocouples is to monitor the temperature distribution throughout the fuel cell stack.  An appropriate location for the thermocouples would be somewhat equally spaced across the stack to monitor differences in temperatures of cells near the endplates verses the temperature of cells in the center or near the center of the fuel cell stack.	The number of internal temperature sensors are a goal (not a requirement) and if the vendor prefers a more appropriate method of monitoring temperature and temperature distribution of the fuel cell, this should be stated in the quotation.  7) When will the decision be made about the vendor? ANSWER: The selection for this procurement will be done after the proposals are received and thoroughly reviewed. 8) Is it possible to get partial/installment payment on this project? ANSWER: No, this does not meet the criteria for partial/installment payment on this procurement.	 9) Are there any page limitation, and/or any particular way that you need the price of the project presented. ANSWER No, there is no page limitation.  Offers must be submitted as described in 52.212-1, INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS.   The due date for receipt of offers is extended until January 16, 2004.  Selection and award will be made to that offeror whose offer will be most advantageous to the Government, with consideration given to the factors of proposed technical merit, price, and past performance.	Other critical requirements: Offeror's proven performance reliability with pure oxygen (not air); Ability to deliver in advance of the required delivery date;  a fuel cell mass below the maximum allowed in the SOW .	Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on December 24, 2003. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and Sources Sought synopsis to identify possible potential sources and submission of capability statements to address the increasing need of a 24-hour access to way-finding materials and hospital information for the National Institutes of Health within the Clinical Center. This is not a request for proposals or quotes and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NACIS) Code is 519190. A user-friendly, touch-screen kiosk would provide communication with patients, visitors, employees, and comfortable transition to the near completion of the CRC expansion area of the facility.  In addition to printable maps with paths and directions for the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health Campus, the kiosks would provide access to the Clinical Center website, general hospital information, and cafeteria services.  Users would find listings of activities, events, meetings, conferences, and training classes taking place at the Clinical Center and the National Institutes of Health as well as links to Institute, protocol, or physician specific information.  Transportation services (shuttles, taxis, Metro, etc.) and local area information (hotels restaurants, entertainment) would also be available via the kiosk.  Additionally, users would be able to complete the Clinical Center customer survey and access virtual programs as they become available.  Seven kiosks would be placed in heavily trafficked lobby areas in the Clinical Center and the CRC.  Three kiosks would be constructed and operational in the Clinical Center by early 2004.  The remaining four would be installed in the new CRC in coordination with facility completion and activation dates.
The proposed project consists of four phases with distinct product deliverables.  The project vendor would complete a facility survey, in coordination with pertinent completion and activation dates for the CRC.  The planning, design, production, and deployment of the kiosks are done by the vendor.  In addition, the vendor is responsible for deployment and training as well as operational and maintenance support. Submission of capability statements by those offerors based on the functional requirements as follows: 1) Each kiosk is expected to be user-intuitive, multilingual, and ADA compliant.  2) The kiosks must have a print function for way-finding materials and hospital information.  3) The system would be built with web-based software that can integrate with other software, websites and internet services. 4) The software shall be easy to update, and it shall have the capacity for adding additional components over time.  5) Furthermore, the software will be accessible through a variety of end user devices, including web browser stations, wireless tablets and PDAs kiosks, and personal computers.  The purpose of the survey is to improve the understanding of the Government requirement and industry capabilities and allow the Government to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices.  Information provided by any vendor in response to this sources sought shall not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the vendors confidential information and will be protected under FAR Part 3.104. Those vendors desiring to submit capability statements should be received no later than January 20, 2004. Any and all proprietary and restricted information provided should be clearly marked.  All capability statements should submit written materials outlining the capability and functionality of the vendors systems and locations where they have them in use.  The information shall be forwarded to Deborah Britton via email at dbritton@cc.nih.gov, fax at (301)594-5920, or phone (301) 594-5914.  Please ensure you have included your return email, address, mailing address, telephone number and facsimile number in the body of your response.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO EXTEND THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF CAPABILITY PACKAGES UNTIL 2 FEBRUARY 2004, TO ALLOW MORE RESPONSE TIME, DUE TO THE HOLIDAYS.  Title :  Uncooled Infrared Detectors; Technical point of contact:  Sam Wood, (256) 876-0617, email:  Sam.Wood@rdec.redstone.army.mil.  The contracts point of contact for this Sources Sought Announcement is Patsy Garrison, (256) 876-8762, email: patsy.garris on@r edstone.army.mil/.  The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Command, Applied Sensors, Guidance and Electronics Directorate, Infrared and Optical Technology Branch, Redstone Arsenal, AL is seeking sources that currently prod uce Uncooled Infrared Detector Assemblies, which can be used in missile applications for guidance or target detection/acquisition. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Command is interested in establishing Bailment A gre ements with qualified detector sources in order to quantify the current state-of-the-art of Uncooled Infrared Technology for Missile Applications.  The U.S. Army is interested in the following array configurations: 1) 160 x 120 arrays with 25 um to 28 u m pixel sizes and thermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds. 2) 160 x 120 arrays with 48 um to 51 um pixel sizes and thermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds. 3) 320 x 240 arrays with 25 um to 28 um pixel si z es and thermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds. 4) 320 x 240 arrays with 48 um to 51 um pixel sizes and thermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds.  5) 640 x 480 arrays with 25 um to 28 um pixel sizes and t hermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds.  6) 640 x 480 arrays with 48 um to 51 um pixel sizes and thermal time constants between 5 milliseconds and 15 milliseconds.  These detectors will be integrated into an Army designed optical test bed.  The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Command requires these detector configurations, described above, to be packaged with necessary supporting electronics to produce digital and analog video from the infrared assemblies.  It is the Army's desire to evaluate detectors that are packaged with and without radiation shields.

<SOLNBR>W912CM-04-MR01
<RESPDATE>013004
<ARCHDATE>03302004
<CONTACT>Carmen Kaufmann, 001-49611816211
<DESC>The Wiesbaden Contracting Center is conducting market research to identify qualified sources for repair and reconstitution of tactical military vehicles and equipment (i.e. wheeled and tracked tactical vehicles and trailers) in Europe.  The requireme nt may include picking up or receiving equipment; technical inspections; estimated costs of repair; determination of repair efforts; repair and/or refurbishment of equipment; final inspection; and transportation to final destinations (within Europe).  Interested parties should demonstrate, in writing, both capability and experience (including past performance information) in the repair of listed military vehicles. Interested parties should also demonstrate, in writing, that they can furnish the faciliti es,  capacity, equipment, materials, and skilled personnel, as well as a verifiable quality control program.  The repair source should have the flexibility and knowledge to develop and provide alternate repair schemes and schedules as well as cost-effectiv e solutions for ordering parts and tracking parts ordered, received, and installed. The Government is anticipates a large influx of equipment that requires rapid repair/refurbishment.  Known sources may not be able to handle this capacity, which could result in work being delayed and additional cost to the Government. The top three proble m areas anticipated are 1) lack of capacity, 2) shortage or delay in receipt of spare parts and 3) a limited number of qualified laborers. The ideal equipment reconstitution process would provide for contractor receipt of equipment at European Sea Ports of Debarkation and move it by efficient means to the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s point of repair/refurbishment.  Equipment receives technical inspectio ns, repair estimates are prepared while considering factors including available commercially available parts, Government furnished parts including Depot-Level Repairable parts, maximum expenditure limits, controlled substitution of parts, priorities of rep air, and production timelines.  Some equipment  may have reached the end of its useable life or may be damaged beyond repair, but still have usable parts the firm can use for in-house repairs.  Equipment is repaired/refurbished by the most efficient means possible.  During this process, military leaders at all levels receive accurate updates on equipment repair status and projected completion dates that is meaningful to them.  Equipment is accounted for; no vehicle location is in doubt from the time the con tractor receives it to the time it is returned.  Progress is reported as a fleet as well as by Corps, Division, Brigade Battalion, or Separate Company.  The firm has effective methods to capture costs of labor and repair, track receipt and installation of Government furnished parts, and deduct Government furnished parts from invoices.  Equipment is returned to the Government fully mission capable.  All faults have been corrected.  Quality control inspections performed by the firm have discovered and resolve d problems prior to final inspection by the Government.  The firm accomplishes the repair/refurbishment process without the involvement of redeploying units/soldiers and with minimal supervision from the Government.  Government/industry teaming concepts wh ich make efficient use of existing government resources can be considered, if significantly less expensive. THE GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE A SOURCEÃ¢Â€Â™S CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY TO RECEIVE, REPAIR, PAINT, TRACK AND REPORT, AND RETURN EQUIPMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT  RECEIVE.  The firm should demonstrate its capability to receive equipment from within Europe to include ports of entry and transport equipment, operational and/or non-operational, to its facilities for repair.   REPAIR.  The firm should demonstrate its capability to return the equipment to a fully mission capable status, in accordance with the equipmentÃ¢Â€Â™s Technical Manuals (See website https//www.logsa.army.mil/etms /welcom1.htm).  Firms should demonstrate capability to perform multiple levels of maintenance (at a minimum, TM -10 through -30, or additionally -40 or -50), and identify the firmÃ¢Â€Â™s capacity and production rates at each level (identify how many weeks are necessary to prepare for and reach full production).  The ability to perform all levels of maintenance for a given type of equipment is not required.  The ability to reconstitute all or most equipment listed is not required.  Firms are expected to be c apable of reconstituting all types of equipment within a listed series. Firms should demonstrate capability to repair some or all of the following families of vehicles/equipment  M101, M105, M149, M870-series, M127-series, and M1000 trailers M939-series (M923, M924, M925, M931, M932, M934, M935, M936) 5-ton trucks M977-series HEMTTs (M978, M983, M984, M985) M998-series HMMWVs (M1038, MM1025, M1026, M996, M997, M1109, M1114) M1070 HET M1074 and M1075 PLS M1-series Abrams tank with embedded diagnostics M2-series Bradley Fighting Vehicle M3-series Cavalry Fighting Vehicle M113-series APC M577-series Command Post APC PAINT.  The firm should demonstrate its capability to spot paint and/or repaint the equipment with Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) in accordance with applicable CARC painting Technical Manuals.  Inability to CARC paint is not a disqualifier.   TRACK AND REPORT.  The firm should demonstrate its capability to track and report equipment reconstitution progress and provide timely, accurate information on equipment location, repair status, and estimated date of completion. Reporting should provide vi sibility on equipment by type, by unit, down to battalion or separate company level, and by bumper number/serial number.  The requirement may include a provision for electronic vehicle tracking systems or other means to ensure accountability of equipment. RETURN.  The firm should demonstrate its capability to deliver reconstituted equipment to holding areas within Europe for final inspection and return to the Government. Interested parties must provide rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the cost to perform the reconstitution effort by vehicle type , as well as estimated production rates and capability at each level of maintenance (at a minimum, TM -10 through -30, or ad ditionally -40 or -50).  Estimates will be non-binding.  The Government may request the opportunity to conduct detailed pre-award surveys.   This announcement is a request for sourcing information and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. All information and data received in response to this request for information marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected and held in strict confidence.

<DESC>Statement of Work:
The Prepositioned Equipment Program

1.  Introduction.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  These tasks UNDER THIS sow are the logical extension of the Prepositioned Emergency Response Equipment Study and are intended to continue execution and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for First Responders on behalf of Wackenhut Services Inc.

2.  Background.  In the FY 2001 Appropriations Bill for Justice, the Joint Conference report indicated that the Appropriations Committee was aware of unfunded requirements for equipping State and local emergency first responders to deal with a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorist incident.  The Committee directed the creation of a Federal prepositioned equipment program to sustain State and local first responders.

To develop the concept for an effective prepositioned equipment program for emergency first responders, the Department of Justice Office for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support (since renamed the Office for Domestic Preparedness and transferred to the Department of Homeland Security) formed a study team and an advisory working group comprising select senior emergency responder subject matter experts from major metropolitan areas across the country.  Five sub-groups, Command and Control, Equipment, Logistics, Medical, and Federal Partners, each led by an experienced member of the emergency response community, focused on key aspects of the concept.  Sub-panels prepared draft concepts for defining the PEP program within their functional area of responsibility.  The study team integrated the findings and recommendations of the sub-panels to provide an integrated baseline approach for the program.  This effort resulted in the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress. 

The Report to Congress constituted Phase I in the development of the PEP program for the First Responders.  Subsequent Phases focus on the implementation and sustainment of the Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP).

3.	Purpose.  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP Program.  

4.	Objectives and Scope.  This SOW has the following objectives: 1) to provide administrative support to sustain the PEP program, 2) to develop, implement and sustain the information technology support required to support the program.   In addition, office space for the Wackenhut Program Coordinator and Facility Manager will be provided by the successful bidder. 

5.	Accomplishments.  Two pivotal accomplishments guide this project:

·	the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Prepositioned Equipment Program (PEP) for Emergency First Responders Report to Congress, and,

·	the WMD Prepositioned Program (PEP) Operations Manual has been written and is awaiting publication by the Department of Homeland Security.

6.   Methodology.  Provide technical and program management support services for the implementation of the PEP program through the integration with other complimentary activities and closely coordinate with key interagency participants in the national approach to the WMD terrorist threat.   

7.  Subtasks.  This SOW consists of four tasks.  Specific tasks are as follows:

Subtask 1 – DEVELOP PLANS AND STANDING OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOPs) FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEP

Develop, as directed by WSI, plans and procedures that will ensure the timely and efficient implementation of the PEP program and will continually refine these plans and procedures as experience with the program identifies improved operational methods.  These plans and procedures shall include provisions for guidance in the functional areas of: facilities management, safety, security, training, Information Technology (IT), and program management support.   

Functions shall include: 

·	conduct background research, data collection, and liaison with stakeholder Federal, State, and local government agencies and commercial partners to support the development of plans and SOPs;
·	validate plans and SOPs through Integrated Process Teams (IPTs) or other forums such as limited gaming events or exercises;
·	facilitate meetings of the PEP working group: prepare agenda, arrange accommodations, develop briefing materials, and prepare minutes of the proceedings; 
·	provide IT support such as desk top publishing; and,
·	prepare documentation.

Potential products could be manuals and SOPs, monthly reports and working group meeting support.

Subtask 2 – COORDINATING EXECUTION OF SELECT PEP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS

Field a PEP capability that will provide federal support to State and local WMD emergency first responders.  This capability includes pre-positioned equipment that is prepared for delivery, where / when needed, and as directed by the cognizant federal authority.  Funchtions shall include:
·	coordinate PEP data collection to ensure the adequacy of the inventory, i.e., quantity, packaging, materiel management and planned transportation of the PEP materiel.  This information will facilitate the efficient expenditure of resources when procuring the remaining PEP Pods; and,
·	adequate IT for materiel management of the prepositioned equipment.

Potential products include the review / update of plans and SOPs.
 
Subtask 3 – PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT FOR THE PEP STORAGE SITES NATIONWIDE. 

	Coordinate the required hardware, software 
and  internet connections to maximize the efficient operation of the various storage sites.  This task will also involve the development, and maintenance of a PEP web site.  Functions shall include:

survey 	each site to determine the most cost effective approach to implement a local area network and to connect the site to the internet;

coordinate the installation of telephone and high speed internet connectivity through the WSI, General Services Administration telephone point of contact;

coordinate the procurement of hardware specific to the requirements at each site through the Marine Corps Systems Command PEP Prime Vendor point of contact;

install the hardware and test the operability of the local area network and the internet connection.

staff a computer support help desk to provide assistance to the storage sites whenever they experience problems with their connectivity;

complete the development of the PEP web site, insure compatibility with the Department of Homeland Security web site protocols, serve as the web site administrator, and, continually update the data posted on the web site.
Subtask 4 – COORDINATE THE TRAINING REQUIRED TO DEPLOY THE PRE-POSITIONED EQUIPMENT TO SUPPORT STATE AND LOCAL WMD FIRST RESPONDERS.

This task will include the provision of technical and management support to ensure that Federal, state, and local government agencies, and commercial partners, are thoroughly trained in all activities required to execute a timely deployment of the PEP program capability.

<DESC>The Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency (HSARPA) invests in programs offering the potential for revolutionary changes in technologies that promote homeland security and accelerates the prototyping and deployment of technologies that reduce homeland vulnerabilities.  HSARPA is the external funding arm for the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate.  HSARPA performs these functions in part by awarding procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions for research or prototypes to public or private entities, businesses, federally funded research and development centers and universities.
A critical area of focus for DHS is the development of radiological and nuclear countermeasure systems that improve our capability to address the threat of a radiological dispersal device (RDD), an improvised nuclear device (IND), or a nuclear weapon being used by terrorists within the US.  DHS S&T is implementing a comprehensive systems approach that emphasizes early detection and effective intervention capabilities at the Federal, state, and local levels, as well as post-event capabilities for remediation.  Under the Detector Systems for Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasures (DSRNC) program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), which will follow from this Draft Statement of Work for Comment (DSWC), HSARPA plans to solicit detector systems that will contribute to an overall system of countermeasures.  
These detector systems must provide a high confidence in detection of nuclear material - even when shielded - while maintaining a low rate of false alarms. The attributes desired for these detection systems include the following.
•	Ability to detect shielded Special Nuclear Material (SNM)
•	High probability of detection of threat materials with a minimum of nuisance alarms and a systematic approach to handle nuisance alarms properly
•	Total cost of ownership low enough to allow systems to be proliferated around points of entry and at critical nodes
The goals of the DSRNC program are to perform the underlying research and development (R&D) to improve existing deployed technologies, and to develop new and enhanced technologies for the detection of nuclear and radiological materials.  
To achieve these goals, the BAA will be organized into six separate Technical Topic Areas (TTAs).  Each TTA will solicit a specific type of detector system.  Each TTA will be structured into three parts.  Part A will address the goal of enhancing capabilities in the near-term by either improving existing deployed systems or rapidly prototyping mature technologies.  Parts B and C will address the goal of developing next generation capabilities.  Part B solicits complete system solutions and Part C solicits enabling component technologies.  For additional information, please see the attached Draft Statement of Work for Comment

                    STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE (SOO)

    TRANSCRIPTION SERVICES FOR ACC INSPECTORS GENERAL OFFICES

                         09 January 2004


1.0 Program Objective:  The objective of ACC IG is for the offeror to supply all necessary labor required for transcription services across United States Air Force Air Combat Command installations, including all levels of command and locations within the command. 

1.1 Description of Need:  Require transcription service for verbatim testimony(s) or interview(s) obtained as a result of an Inspector General (IG) investigation or analysis.  Testimony is either taped, via cassette or mini-cassette, or digitally recorded (WAV files).  The number of testimonies requiring transcription or number of pages of transcription cannot be determined prior to an investigation nor can the number of investigations per fiscal year be predicted.  The total amount of transcribed pages throughout Air Combat Command in FY03 was approximately 4045, with an average of 8 days turnaround rate.  In addition, the timeframe of the taped interviews can not be determined and may result in the investigating officer sending separate testimony to the transcriber as it becomes available.  

2.0 Technical Objectives: 

2.1 Contractor Knowledge:  Familiarity with military jargon, acronyms, etc., is required.

2.2 Product Format:  

2.2.1 Paper:  8 ½ by 11, White Bond.  Legal size paper can be used, if first approved by customer.

2.2.2 Software:  Document returned to customer will be a Microsoft Word document.  Air Combat Command is utilizing Microsoft Office XP.  All documents should remain compatible to this version of Microsoft Office.  

2.2.3 Margins:  Margins for documents can be no less than ½ inch on all sides of the paper and no more than 1 inch margin on all sides of the paper.  

2.2.4 Font:  12 Pitch, Times New Romans or Arial is the font approved for Air Combat Command.

3.0 Performance Objectives:

3.1 Product Delivery Turnaround Time:  An expedient turnaround time would be expected.  The commercial average rate of turnaround would be sufficient, with options for quicker service on special occasions, as long as the agreed upon advance notice is given.  ACC installations/units will send tapes via mail or electronic mail.  Completed work will be sent back via an express mail service.  Alternative means of document submission will also be considered.  

3.2 Product Quality:  The government seeks a commercial quality transcription service that can produce error-free transcribed documents within a reasonable amount of time.

<SUBJECT>B--KENNEDY SPACE CENTER SABBATICAL PROGRAM (KSP) FOR UNIVERSITY FACULTY
<DESC>Kennedy Space Center Sabbatical Program  (KSP) for University Faculty  DUE 02/20/04	POC Mrs. Leslie M. Solum , 321-867-0299, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Kennedy Space Center, Mail Code OP-ES, KSC, FL 32899.	 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is offering an opportunity for university faculty to collaborate with KSC while on sabbatical.  Faculty with a research interest in an area matching the KSC technical activities listed below are invited to send a proposal to KSC by February 20, 2004.  It is intended the sabbatical activity would occur in one of the following timeframes:  1)  the sabbatical would commence in August, 2004 and end in May, 2005 or 2)  the sabbatical would commence in either August 2004, or January 2005 and run one semester.   It is highly encouraged faculty leverage this sabbatical opportunity with the NASA Faculty Fellowship Program, or other matching funding, to lengthen the stay at KSC to include summer, 2004 and/or summer 2005.  Information on the NASA Faculty Fellowship Program can be found at:   http://www.asee.org/nffp/ Note that a separate application must be submitted by February 2, 2004 to the NFFP program.  Faculty should note on that application that they are also applying to the KSC Sabbatical Program. 1)  The three technical areas of interest are: 1)     A sabbatical position is available for a university faculty member with experience in the preparation of microencapsulated materials to help support the development of a new class of electrical wire insulation.  This effort would be part of an ongoing project to develop insulating materials that have the ability to self-repair.  This is a complex project that encompasses several related areas that include polymer synthesis, polymer degradation, reactive materials, and photochemistry.  It is envisioned that the successful applicant would spend the majority of their time in the laboratory working with our chemical technicians.  The hope is that a long-term relationship can be established to continue the development of these insulating materials.  KSC Contact:  Dr. Clyde Parrish, clyde.f.parrish@nasa.gov 2)  The Corrosion Research and Engineering Group at NASA’s John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is interested in carrying research focused on the areas of understanding, detection, prevention, mitigation, and control of corrosion that affects systems such as space flight hardware, ground support equipment, and facility infrastructures to increase safety and reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Current research areas of interest include the investigation of the corrosive properties of tubing alloys using electrochemical techniques in combination with atmospheric exposure, development of environmentally compliant coating systems, non-destructive detection of corrosion, reinforced concrete protection research, and identification and characterization of an alternative refractory materials for the Main and Side Flame Deflectors at LC39.  More information on the KSC Corrosion Research and Engineering Group can be found at: http://corrosion.ksc.nasa.gov/	     KSC Contact: Dr. Luz Marina Calle, luz.m.calle@nasa.gov 3) A growing concern within both the military and aerospace communities is the absorption of water in composite materials.  It is well known that these materials can absorb as much as 3% of their weight in water and normally this is not an issue.  But in applications where excessive heating can occur, it appears that the water can boil and damage the composite. A significant effort is under way to research and develop Thermal Protection Systems Detection Technologies to measure water content in current and future thermal protection systems, including tiles, blankets, graphite epoxy, and composite materials. KSC contact:  Dr. Robert Youngquist at robert.c.youngquist@nasa.gov  Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact the KSC representative before applying.  For technical information, contact the names above.  For administrative information contact Dr. Gregg Buckingham, gregg.a.buckingham@nasa.gov (2) Pursuant to 32 CFR Sec. 22.315 and Sec. 22.320, this announcement is open only to eligible U.S. colleges and universities.  Proposals from minority universities are encouraged.  In addition, applicants must be U.S. citizens.    (3) The proposal shall not exceed 10 pages (81/2 x 11 single-spaced), in English text.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Request for Expressions of Interest - Participation in the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center's Education and Training Partnership with the State of Oklahoma's Colleges, Universities and Trade Schools
<DESC>1)  This is a request for companies interested in working with the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) and State of Oklahoma educational institutions to graduate/produce workers prepared to fill a variety of blue collar and white collar positions at OC-ALC in the future.  OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions established an Education and Training Partnership a few years ago to do just that.  This joint endeavor has been very successful to date.  This partnership is very important in light of an aging existing OC-ALC workforce and a smaller pool of workers in younger generations.  At the same time, OC-ALC is embarking upon several transformation initiatives to improve efficiency and effectiveness and ultimately improve support to our operational forces.     2)  OC-ALC's success in the future will depend upon its ability to recruit and hire a highly capable organic workforce while at the same time expanding its partnerships with industry.  As we expand these partnerships with industry, our industry partners will also have a need for new workers.  To avoid competing for the limited number of current graduates, OC-ALC is interested in working with industry and state educational institutions to increase its current capacity for producing skilled workers.  OC-ALC envisions interested companies collaborating with their industry colleagues to jointly determine their future workforce needs in support of Tinker Air Force Base by entering into an agreement for that increased capacity with state educational institutions.  OC-ALC also envisions establishing an Associate Contractor-like Agreement with its industry partners to outline the rules of engagement.  OC-ALC will not be a party to or responsible for any industry commitment or agreement for hiring workers produced by state educational institutions.     3)  However, OC-ALC does expect to cooperate with its industry partners in this endeavor.  Those companies interested in discussing the potential for working with OC-ALC and Oklahoma educational institutions for future education and training needs are requested to submit written or electronic expressions of interest to the Contracting Officer listed below not later than 31 January 2004.

<SUBJECT>R--Maintenance of the GeneTests Database
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Washington, Seattle, WA for a cost reimbursement type contract for the creation and maintenance of records in the GeneTests database.  GeneTests is a database that contains the following principal components:  (1) peer-reviewed descriptions of genetic diseases written by subject matter experts including curated information on genetic tests for diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling; (2) a directory of laboratories which perform research and clinical testing for genetic disorders; (3) a directory of U.S. and international genetics clinics which provide genetic evaluation and genetic counseling services.  GeneTests contains over 210 disease descriptions written by clinical and laboratory experts and peer-reviewed by both an internal and external group of reviewers.  The disease descriptions follow a consistent format including topics on clinical descriptions, diagnosis, management, counseling, molecular genetics, and resources.  Each entry is regularly updated in a formal review process.  The laboratory directory includes over 570 laboratories performing clinical testing for 639 diseases and research on 350 diseases.  Testing includes DNA-based, cytogenetic, and biochemical tests.  Each entry contains the name, symbol, and synonyms for the tested gene, the chromosomal locus, laboratory personnel and genetics board certifications.  The clinics directory has over 1080 clinics listed with information on the staff certification, services provided, specialty clinics and contact information.  Educational materials are also available which provide a medical genetics glossary and explanations of genetic testing and consultation.  The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of GeneTests as a comprehensive and up to date source of genetic testing information for a diverse audience that includes both healthcare professionals as well as the lay public.    Specifically, this contract will add to and continuously update the content within each of the GeneTests resources as new information becomes available from the various scientific and clinical disciplines related to inherited disease susceptibility.  For GeneReviews the selection of disease profiles is based upon the availability of clinical testing procedures, the importance of testing in diagnosis, risk counseling, and early treatment.   Entries are created and peer-reviewed by scientists and clinicians recognized as experts for that specific disorder.  An in-house review process assures editorial consistency and integration of GeneReviews with the other GeneTests resources.  The content of the GeneTests database is copyrighted by the University of Washington and Children’s Health System.  The staff at the University of Washington have regularly been maintaining and updating the database since 1992 when the Laboratory Directory was established, followed by the GeneReviews disease descriptions in 1997.  Because the compilation of laboratories and of structured, expert-authored and peer-reviewed disease descriptions is unique, because the University of Washington owns the rights to the data, and because the University of Washington maintains the GeneTests database, it has been determined that the University of Washington is the only source capable of fulfilling NLM’s requirements.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor is an RFP available.
