<DESC>The 708th Armament Systems Group (708 ARSG), 308th Armament Systems Wing (ARSW), Eglin AFB, FL plans an acquisition for a Joint Capabilities Technology Demonstration (JCTD) of a Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze System (HTVSF), a cockpit programmable system that will provide multi-delay arming and detonation as well as void sensing functions for a BLU-113 or BLU-109 weapon to penetrate and destroy hardened targets protected by multiple layers of reinforced material.  Additional technical details are available on FedBizOps (www.fbo.gov) under Industry Day notifications posted on 11 July 2007 and 28 August 2007.  Two contractors will be selected for award of separate JCTD contracts to design, test, and demonstrate the capabilities of each of their proposed HTVSF systems to meet the requirements specified in the System Requirements Document.  The SRD is available on FedBizOps under Industry Day Notification - Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze System, HTVSF Draft Documents, posted 19 July 2007.  During a planned 27 month period of performance, the two JCTD contractors will be evaluated against predetermined evaluation criteria, and one will be selected to deliver 20 residual HTVSF JCTD assets and to be awarded a follow-on System Demonstration and Development (SDD) contract.  The single SDD contractor is expected to receive a sole-source follow-on production contract award for production of the HTVSF.  Pending a final determination regarding foreign source participation, the Government anticipates awarding one JCTD contract under full and open competition and the other under a competition restricted to U.S. sources only; although, the Government reserves the right to pursue a Small Business Set-Aside.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INVITATION FOR BID AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Responses to this synopsis will be considered with respect to the contractor?s capabilities to meet the HTVSF requirements for JCTD and potential follow-on SDD and production contracts; however, responders will not be provided the results of the Government assessment of their qualifying packages.  Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 15 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS Code/Size Standard are 332995/500 employees.  Interested firms must have secret level security clearance.  For technical information on this synopsis, contact Major Corey Harris, (850) 882-8787, ext. 2204 or Michael Bowen, (850) 882-8787, ext. 3266.  Collect call will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Bill Kingsley, C130 Contract Specialist, Phone (252)384-7283, Fax (252)335-6452, Email William.T.Kingsley@uscg.mil
<DESC>The proposed acquisition is to acquire the services and supplies necessary to accomplish depot maintenance of an estimated three (3) aircraft per contract year for a total estimated fifteen (15) HC-130H aircraft in accordance with a PSI-Baseline Work Specification for a period of five (5) years.  The RFP will use the procedures of FAR Part 12 and 15. This requirement shall be delineated into distinct efforts to include PSI-B Inspection, Repair Phase, and Unscheduled Depot Level Maintenance (UDLM).  Performance of PSI-B Inspection and subsequent Repair Phase work shall constitute a baseline overhaul of the Coast Guards HC-130(H) aircraft and delineates the minimum work requirements for flight test and preparation for delivery by the depot facility and return of the aircraft to a serviceable condition.   All maintenance shall be performed using established procedures as outlined in USAF/USCG technical orders and publications. The Coast Guard does not maintain nor can it provide technical documents of another government agency.  Contractors must provide all facilities, labor, tooling, materials, test equipment, and managerial staff to perform the required work. The contractor must possess access to all required USAF Technical Order specifications, drawings and data to include specific load/stress analysis data, historical load analysis data or equivalent strength analysis data peculiar to the C-130H aircraft. Contractors must possess and maintain, for the life of the contract, a current FAA or international equivalent certification to perform Programmed Depot Maintenance type work for large body aircraft.  The Coast Guard will not delay award nor contract performance in anticipation of any of the certifications/assessments described herein.  Proposals will be requested for firm-fixed-price IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity) type contract for one base year and four options years. Delivery will be 160 days from induction date.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 336411 and the procurement is unrestricted.
Contract award will be based on Best Value to include Technical, Past Performance, and Price.

Request for Proposal HSCG38-08-R-H00006 has an approximate release date of  7 January 2008.
The solicitation will be made available by posting to FedBizOpps.
Questions should be directed in writing to Bill Kingsley (Contract Specialist), william.t.kingsley@uscg.mil.

Contractors must use the ORCA (Online Annual Representations and Certifications) through http://www.bpn.gov; must have an active record in Central Contractor Registration in accordance with FAR 52.204-7; and must show evidence in proposal of their registration with the National Institute of Health?s Contractor Performance System via https://cpscontractor.nih.gov. 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692, Fax:  (202) 475-3904. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award Phase 1b Virtual Mission Training System (VMTS) as a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement, N00019-05-G-0026.  This is a continuation of an existing contractual effort to integrate a synthetic radar VMTS into the US Navy T-45C trainer aircraft.  The period of performance will be approximately twenty four months and the requirement will involve the non-recurring engineering and integration services in support of an aircraft Engineering Change Proposal.

The integration efforts include the non-recurring engineering design, integration, test, validation and verification of two flight-worthy VMTS retrofit kits that will be incorporated into a production representative T-45C aircraft.  The kits shall include VMTS hardware and aircraft modification hardware in accordance with PRF-T45 VMTS-001 specifications.  This Order will deliver the retrofit modification drawing package to install the VMTS kits into the flight test aircraft, produce sufficient hardware equipment to satisfy supplier and laboratory integration testing and provide enough spares to support the VMTS flight test effort.

The synthetic radar will emulate an existing F/A-18 radar system and include capabilities such as a radar warning receiver, air-to-air weapons simulation, and fleet representative radar controls.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort as a sole source procurement to The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source).  The Boeing Company is the sole designer, developer, systems integrator and producer of the T-45 aircraft, thus the only firm that possesses the requisite knowledge and integration capability to satisfy the pending requirement in the required timeframe.

This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. This synopsis is provided for information purposes only. A determination not to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the United States Government.

While it is understood that FedBizOpps is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FedBizOpps is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Crane Division.  You may also access information on the NSWC Crane Division web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm. The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane intends to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with L-3 Communications Corporation, Communications System West, 640 North 2200 West, Salt Lake City UT 84116-2925 with a ceiling amount of $11,400,000.00.  The BOA will cover a five year period and include line items for engineering/logistics support, spares procurement, depot repair to include re-assembly, upgrade/modification of assemblies and/or subassemblies in support of the Tactical Common Data Link-Navy System (TCDL-N). Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2303(c) (1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed drawings/specifications, test procedures and test stations in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  This synopsis will fulfill the BOA requirement to issue a synopsis for job ord!  ers on an annual basis.  This will be a ?follow on? contract of a previous BOA contract that was awarded to L-3 Communications in 2004.  Numbered Notes 22 and 26 apply.   All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date, 29 January 2008, will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps, and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offeror?s that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for three tasks at its Multi-Function Electronic Warfare Facility located at the Chesapeake Bay Detachment at Chesapeake Beach, Md.  A site visit to inspect the facility is anticipated, and details will be included in the solicitation.  The first task of  maintenance and modifications will involve inspecting the existing mechanical and electrical connections and ordering and replacement of component mechanical and electrical connections for the existing trailers which comprise the facility.  Because this task could involve emergency work, the successful 
offeror must be available, have proper security clearances, be located a reasonable distance from the facility, and have available equipment and ample mechanics certified in multiple trades available on an on call basis 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

The second task involves performing major modifications, including disassembly of a transmit or receive array pallet from its present location on either the transmit or receive shelter, and preparing it for shipping for array repair or modifications.  This may include removal and disassembly of radar absorbing material. Upon receipt of the modified array pallet, the contractor shall reinstall the array pallet on the transmit or receive shelter flange. It is anticipated that four removals and re-assemblies will occur during each calendar year

The third task involves performing special supplemental adaptive work, including but not limited to: adding or moving an antenna, adding new cable or connections, mounting new equipment, performing seasonal preventative conditioning, adding modified weldments both in steel and aluminum, modifying components by cutting, drilling, or tapping, and preparing and painting all or any part of the facility.  Effort under this task may occur up to twelve times per year.

It is contemplated that one award will be made resulting from this solicitation, and that the successful offeror will perform all three tasks.  The successful offeror will be required to provide materials, a staff of skilled mechanics with skills in all trades of mechanical and electrical manufacturing and assembly, including electrical and electronic assemblers, steel and aluminum welders, and have a Maryland Profession Engineer on staff.  The successful offeror will also be expected to provide some equipment, such as a 100' boom, a 85 ton crane and aerial work platforms as required.

NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  This requirement is full and open competition.  This solicitation and 
other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website:

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center (LaRC) plans to release a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for the Explopration Technology Technology Development Program Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology Project. The purpose of this NRA is to solicit partners to research, develop, and demonstrate component- and subsystem-level technologies specifically related to ALHAT that will increase performance, reduce risk, cost, size, and mass of a state of the art sensor capable of enabling a descent vehicle to autonomously perform a safe and accurate landing. The basic technology chosen for this sensor is flash LIDAR. Flash LIDAR provides a 3-D imaging capability which can be exploited to generate the necessary information for accurate navigation by implementation of appropriate real time signal and/or image processing techniques. The goal is to advance the core sensor component technologies to a technology readiness level that enables their eventual infusion into future space flight missions. Upon its release date, this NRA will be available electronically through FedBizOpps.gov and Grants.gov Participation is open to all categories of organizations, foreign and domestic, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, and other Government agencies. Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, Grants.gov, or at both sites, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Research Triangle Park, NC is responsible for procuring, testing, and distributing filters of high purity to the State and Local air pollution control agencies.  The agency has a requirement for glass fiber and quartz filters.  The quartz filters are used with a Size Selective Sampler (SSI) to collect PM-10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers) samples.  The glass fiber filters are used with a Total Suspended Particulate (TSP) sampler.  This process assures filters with uniform characteristics and known quality assurance testing for the national particulate networks. The filters for a specific year must be made from the same lot of raw materials for distribution.

<SUBJECT>16 -- SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE END-TO-END PROTECTION OF ACARS C2 MESSAGES
<SOLNBR>R1721
<CONTACT>Jeremy Kruger jeremy.kruger@us.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THE END-TO-END PROTECTION OF ACARS COMMAND AND CONTROL MESSAGES FOR THE USAF AIR MOBILITY COMMAND (AMC) FLEET THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. 	The 853d Electronic Systems Group, Global Air Traffic Management Division (853 ELSG/NT) has the mission of supporting the acquisition of CNS/ATM avionics for the Air Force, other Department of Defense (DoD) entities, and/or other federal agencies to allow unrestricted access of military aircraft to worldwide airspace.  The 853 ELSG/NT is seeking information on solutions available for the end-to-end protection of ACARS command and control messages for the USAF AMC fleet. 	The USAF has been working to upgrade the majority of its Air Mobility Command (AMC) fleet to comply with commercial Communication, Navigation, & Surveillance, / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements.  The overarching objective of this program is to ensure continued, unrestricted access to airspace around the world in support of the USAF mission.  The communication component of this upgrade includes a commercial air/ground data link capability commonly referred to as ACARS (Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System). The ACARS data link capability, together with the FANS 1/A applications and ARINC 622 protocol, will allow AMC equipped aircraft to communicate directly with Air Traffic Control (ATC) in some regions of the world. 	A benefit of ACARS equipage, is the ability of the flight crew to leverage this "found" bandwidth on the flight deck to communicate directly with an operational command and control center. Commercial airlines have been taking advantage of this benefit since the 1970s, with the family of software messages called Aeronautical Operational Control (AOC).  During a demonstration of this capability, during an exercise in 1999, USAF AMC became interested in acquiring this AOC communications capability.  AMC wishes to provide the flight managers at the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) with this tool, to aid in dispatch and mission management.   Unfortunately, embracing and successfully leveraging this new capability has resulted in some concerns.  Specifically, the ACARS infrastructure does not inherently offer the user any protection of message content. The air-to-ground and ground-to-air messages are sent "in the clear", over published frequencies, in a human readable format, in the same manner that VHF voice is sent.  Airlines concerned with protecting the content of potentially sensitive messages have acquired their own security solutions compatible with the existing civil network infrastructure.  So, USAF AMC, seeing the security issue as a potentially critical vulnerability, elected to limit use of AOC data link to only a few messages until the security issue could be addressed. Recently, the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) formed a Data Link Security Subcommittee (DSEC) to address the ACARS security issue.  The AEEC develops engineering standards and technical solutions for avionics, networks, and cabin systems, which foster increased efficiency and reduced life cycle costs throughout the aviation community.  USAF AMC was an active participant in the DSEC subcommittee that has now recently developed an industry standard, commonly referred to as Project Paper 823.  It provides standard guidance on both shared secret and PKI-based data link security solutions.  The document also includes guidance on life-cycle management of cryptographic keys.  The USAF AMC has determined that the PKI-based solution outlined in AEEC Project Paper 823, if properly implemented on ACARS equipped AMC platforms, would provide an adequate level of security to support a more comprehensive use of ACARS data link for mission management. 	The USAF is seeking information on all possible solutions of implementation of the AEEC 823 standard on its AMC CNS/ATM equipped aircraft.  More specifically, information is sought on the implementation of a solution that is end-to-end, PKI-based, and 823 compliant, for transport of command and control or AOC messages.  It is envisioned that the initial data link communications for mission management will be between AMC aircraft and the TACC at Scott AFB.  It is possible that there will be additional ground data link hosts communicating with the AMC aircraft in the future. Respondents should: 	- Address CNS/ATM configurations of the KC-135, C-5 and C-17 at a minimum, but 	consideration of all current and planned CNS/ATM equipages is desired. 	- Reply with an end-to-end solution that addresses all of the associated subnetworks: airborne,air/ground, and ground.  	 	- Not exceed 15 pages with their capability to deliver the proposed data-link security solution on the USAF CNS/ATM equipped aircraft. 	- Provide product specifications that verify the ability of their products to meet applicable CNS/ATM standards in addition to the AEEC 823 standard. 	- Provide a Point of Contact (POC) within your corporation. 	- Clearly indicate on any correspondence of a sensitive nature, "proprietary" or "restricted." The government's intention is not to disqualify any source from a potential solicitation. 	- Include one original paper copy and one electronic copy on CD. Use either Adobe Portable Document (.pdf) format or Microsoft Office products.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.

Description

Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure.  Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following:  development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radiocuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLO-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP-pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.

The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.

Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about December 5, 2007, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.

This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Thermo Fisher Scientific (Ashville, NC), LLC, for the purchase of an Automatic Thermoluminescent Dosimetry (TLD) System.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Safety, Health, and Environment Division at NIST requires an Automatic Thermoluminescent Dosimetry (TLD) System, Harshaw TLD Model 6600 Plus Automated TLD Reader.  The Harshaw 6600 Plus Reader is the only system that is compatible with NIST?s Sr90 irradiator source, which is installed in an older Harshaw Reader.  The Harshaw 6600 Plus Reader is the only system compatible with and capable of irradiating and reading NIST?s existing stock of TLD?s and chipstrates.  This Reader?s compatibility with NIST?s established data provides the ability to maintain continuity with said data.  Therefore, the required equipment must be 100 percent compatible with the existing equipment.  Thermo Fisher Scientific (Ashville, NC), LLC, is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the system that is required to satisfy the Government?s minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 5, 2007, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command propose a 5 year firm fixed price follow-on contract to the existing Sikorsky/CCAD partnership contract DAAH23-03-D-0043.  The follow-on will include both supplies and technical/engineering/logistical suppor t services (TELSS) to support Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) in the repair and recapitalization of the H-60 Aircraft.  This is a fully integrated effort that involves the procurement of combined integrated services and supplies to support CCAD in meeting  the required agreed to reductions in repair turn around time (RTAT).  The contractor must be able to provide the full range of services and 100% of material in order to meet the Governments requirement.  The contractor will provide technology insertion, obsolescence management and test and support of equipment upgrades in support of reliability improvements for the H-60 Weapon System.  The contractor will advise CCAD in establishing commercial best practices in the areas of production planning, production  control, material management and process engineering.  This effort also requires that the contractor develop repair, recap, and structural workstation kits and provide logistical support function in the inventory management of the parts and the material r equired by CCAD in the repair of the H-60 Weapon System in order to streamline CCAD component production.  Complete and adequate data is not available to support full and open competition.  This effort is a continuation of the existing sole source contract  to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06615, who alone has the background design knowledge experience, data, and/or equipment to support technical, engineering, material, and modernization capability required for this effort. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors are encouraged to contact Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Ms. Shelia Harris 203-386-3387) for subcontracting opportunities on this effort.  Government POC for  this effort is Ms. Tracey McGraw (256)842-7630.  See numbered note(s) 22.

<DESC>The correct solicitation number for this action is W58RGZ-08-R-0005. Because this action is an integrated services and supplies requirement, separate synopses are required in both the services and material arenas. The initial synopsis was published f or the services arena under service class action code R. This action is to re-submit the synopsis for publishing in the supply arena. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command propose a 5 year firm fixed price follow-on contract to the existing Sikorsky/CCAD partnership contract DAAH23-03-D-0043.  The follow-on will include both supplies and technical/engineering/logistical support serv ices (TELSS) to support Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD) in the repair and recapitalization of the H-60 Weapon System.  This is a fully integrated effort that involves the procurement of combined integrated services and supplies to support CCAD in meeting the required agreed to reductions in repair turn around time (RTAT).  The contractor must be able to provide the full range of services and 100% of material in order to meet the Governments requirement.  The contractor will provide technology insertion, o bsolescence management and test and support of equipment upgrades in support of reliability improvements for H-60 Aircraft.  The contractor will advise CCAD in establishing commercial best practices in the areas of production planning, production control, material management and process engineering.  This effort also requires that the contractor develop repair, recap, and structural workstation kits and provide logistical support function in the inventory management of the parts and the material required by  CCAD in the repair of the H-60 Weapon System in order to streamline CCAD component production.  Complete and adequate data is not available to support full and open competition.  This effort is a continuation of the existing sole source contract to Sikors ky Aircraft Corporation, 6900 Main Street, Stratford, CT 06615, who alone has the background design knowledge experience, data, and/or equipment to support technical, engineering, material, and modernization capability required for this effort.  All respon sible offerors may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors are encouraged to contact Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Ms. Shelia Harris 203-386-3387) for subcontracting opportunities on this effort.  Government POC for this effo rt is Ms. Tracey McGraw (256)842-7630.  See numbered note(s) 22.

<DESC>This document is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) sponsored by the U. S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision Electronics Sensors Directorate (NVESD).  This BAA is issued under provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acqui sition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and f ully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  This BAA will be posted on the Interagency Business Opportunities Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  Any amendments to this BAA will only be posted at the IBOP.  It is recomm ended that all interested parties register for the solicitation specific mailing list that will provide email notification of any updates to the BAA. It is expected that Award(s) against this BAA can be made for two years after notification of selectability.  Specific costs, terms and conditions will be negotiated prior to award. The Government contemplates the award of Cost Reimbursement (i.e., Cost Pl us Fixed Fee) type contract(s).  However, proposals based on other contract types will be considered. Offerors must have an adequate accounting system to be awarded a Cost Reimbursement type contract.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. The maximum length of an award will be three years. There is no a priori judgment regarding the number or size of individual awards or the allocation of total research and development funds across the technolog y solutions.  Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for respons e to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  No contract award will be made unles s appropriated funds are available for payment for the effort being acquired.  Potential offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted contracting officer may obligate the government to an agreement involving the expenditure of Government funds.  Any re sultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements. This BAA is intended for the development of research efforts in support of the NVESD - Countermine Division.  Specific information on program goals is provided in the Program Description Section.  After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Offerors must have a Secret Facility Level Clearance in order to participate in the BAA.   In order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include both technical and cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals shall be submitted in electronic format via the CECOM LCMC Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  The URL for the IBOP is https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. The IBOP submittal shall include an electronic signature by an individual having a uthority to enter into a contract.  In order to be able to access the BAA and submit a proposal a contractor must first be registered on the IBOP.  A CAGE Code and DUNS number are required to complete registration for proposal submission s.  A contractor employee who is authorized to bind the contractor must complete the registration.  The process could take several days to finalize the registration and contractors are encouraged to register as soon as possible.  The NVESD Countermine Division is searching for varying technological approaches that can remotely and autonomously detect, mark, and neutralize explosive threats and which are suitable to be deployed on a Talon-class robotic platform.  The objective is to  identify and evaluate technical approaches that would allow these capabilities to be deployed on a small robot to support dismounted forces.  Technical approaches should be viable in a wide class of military environments such as dust, extreme heat and col d, precipitation, and humidity.  The specific technology gap being addressed is the need for integration of autonomous detection, marking, and neutralization capabilities on a single, autonomous, robotic platform where Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) are hi ghly constrained. Rapid fielding initiatives and other efforts have addressed the autonomy, detection, marking, and neutralization problem, but without combining: 1. Autonomous detection, 2. Autonomous robotic navigation, and 3. Talon or smaller SWaP. This BAA will consider technologies that fall into two categories: (1) detection of explosive threats and the marking of threats and safe lanes, and (2) the neutralization of explosive threats.  For each of these two categories, a high degree of autonomy a nd the ability to be employed on a Talon-class, autonomous, robotic platform are desired.  Awards made under this BAA may address either of these two categories.  Proposals that simultaneously address both categories are highly encouraged.  Proposals that include a demonstration of autonomous detection, marking, and neutralization with autonomous platform navigation in a robotic vehicle are also highly encouraged.  There will be no formal request for proposal or any further solicitation document issued in regard to this BAA.  Therefore, interested parties should be alert for any amendments that may be published.  Amendments to this BAA will be issued through the IBOP .  Offerors may register for auto notification by registering for this specific BAA. Offerors may submit questions related to this BAA electronically using the Question format available in the Army IBOP BAA  Autonomous Countermine Technologies solicitation folder. Questions of a technical nature may be addressed to the project lead, Ms. E loisa Lara, NVESD, at eloisa.lara@us.army.mil, with a carbon copy to the Contracting Office Point of Contacts identified on the IBOP, until such time as a proposal has been submitted.  All questions of a contractual nature and all questions after proposal submission must be directed to the Contracting Office Point of Contacts specified at the IBOP (Michelle Hodges, michelle.hodges@us.army.mil or Marilyn Shortle, marilyn.shortle@us.army.mil).    ALL POTENTIAL OFFERORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT DUE TO UNANTICIPATE D BUDGET FLUCTUATIONS, FUNDING IN ANY OR ALL AREAS CAN CHANGE WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE.

The mitigation site is managed under agreement with County Parks as wildlife habitat by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and is part of the Stone Lakes National Wildlife Reserve. The proposed BUOW mitigation str ategy is compatible with this management regime.

Information furnished as a minimum should include appropriate information and professional qualifications that demonstrates th e firms ability to meet the requirements listed above.

The size standard for this  procurement is $6,500,000 average annual receipts over the last 3 fiscal years. Award of the contract to the selected firm is anticipated in July 2008.  2.  PROJECT INFORMATION: The following information is specific to the primary intended use of this con tract - the NMUSA project.  This IDIQ contract may be used to provide similar A-E services on other projects.  The National Museum of the United States Army will be a 21st Century museum of excellence, recognized as a national and international visitor des tination, which will be built at Fort Belvoir.  The museum will honor the service and sacrifice of the Soldier, veteran, and the entire Army Family.  The museum  will engage, entertain, and educate visitors to the historic role of the Army in the development of the Nation and the current relationship of the Army to the people of this Nation, which will help ensure the continued growth of the Army into the future.  In addition, the museum will inspire visitors and promote esprit de corps among Soldiers, preserve the legacy of the U.S. Army, ensure accurate and comprehensive portrayal of the Armys story, and serve as the capstone of the U.S. Army Museum System.  The  following project information is provided to give prospective offerors an indication of the scale of the project.  This information is currently being validated and may be subject to change before initiating Phase 2 of the selection process. This project calls for the design of a new museum complex to support approximately 150,000 gross square feet (GSF) of internal spaces initially, with room to add up to 85,000 GSF in future phase(s).  The project is expected to be located on a site of approximately 85 a cres on land presently occupied by the Fort Belvoir North Post Golf Course.  Under this contract, the A-E will be tasked with developing the master campus plan but only the initial phase will be designed to 100%.  The museum building may conceptually be di vided into four sections: gallery areas, public areas, exterior program, and administrative areas.  Gallery areas are the main internal visitor attractions of the museum.  Public areas consist of access, circulation, service, education, catering, and retai l space.  Exterior program  the initial phase includes a parade ground with permanent and temporary seating for several thousand people, a memorial garden, an amphitheater, a comfort station, and parking; future phases may include a gallery for macro obje cts, outdoor education and encampment area, temporary use stable, and expansion of the memorial garden.  Lastly are the administrative areas, which provide working areas for the staff, and space for minor maintenance of exhibits and collections. The goals of the NMUSA identified above will be achieved through the display of the NMUSAs extensive collections and other sensory experiences that will accompany them.  The design will specifically address involvement of the NMUSAs visitors by appealing to their emotions through the relation of stories of the service and sacrifice of the soldiers of the U.S. Army in a manner that truly engages the visitor.  State-of-the-art communication links and audio-visual technology will be included in the project.  The selec ted designer will work closely with the NMUSA staff, CENAE, and the exhibit designer (procured under a separate contract) throughout the planning and design of all facilities.  The project may also include the re-design of portions of the North Post Golf C ourse to accommodate the NMUSA.  The project includes architectural, landscape, and interior design; civil, structural, transportation/traffic, geotechnical, mechanical, and electrical engineering and design services; and the design for communication, fire  protection, redundant power and information systems, and also access control and intrusion detection systems (IDS).  Design of the NMUSA will need to meet the sustainable design standard of LEED  Silver and be in compliance with Department of Defense Ant i-terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP) standards.  Access for the handicapped must be provided in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Comprehensive interior design services are required. Construction cost estimates will be prepared using th e U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Micro-Computer Aided Cost Engineering System (M-CACES) (software provided by Government).  Specifications will be produced using Uniform Facilities Guide Specifications.  Use of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Building Infor mation Modeling (BIM) technologies are mandatory.  All CAD files shall be fully compatible with either AutoCAD 2007 or MicroStation V8.  All BIM models shall be  developed using Autodesk Revit 9.0, AutoCAD Architectural Desktop 2007, or Bentley Architecture V8.  Estimated Construction Cost of the initial phase of the project (not including exhibits) is between 100 and 150 million dollars.  While the ordering perio d for the IDIQ contract is 5 years, the estimated duration for specific design requirements for the NMUSA project is 18 months.  3.

<DESC>This is a link to the all the documents applicable to the F-16 Mission  Training Center (MTC) Follow-On effort.  The RFP number associated with  this effort is FA8621-07-R-6291, and should not be confused with the  Interim Service contract for the F-16 MTC (RFP: FA8621-05-6253). This solicitation notice is updated as of 20 November 2007.  18 June 2007:  The DRAFT SOO and DRAFT SCRD are now attached to this synopsis.  We will  be conducting industry day meetings from 10 Jul 07 through 13 Jul 07.  Please send an email to kraig.neer@wpafb.af.mil to schedule an industry  day question and answer period.  The sessions will be scheduled on a  first-come-first-served basis.  Also, the F-16 MTC team would like to  remind all perspective offerors that they must be a United States owned  company and have the proper Defense Security Service Facility Security  Clearance.  16 July 2007: The Industry Day charts are now attached below.  23 July 07: We have attached AFRL Technical Report,TR98-0058, Display  Collimation and the Perceived Size of Flight Simulator Imagery.  This  report is provided for your information and should be considered part of  the Bidders Library.  15 Oct 07:  The draft SOO and SCRD have been deleted  in preparation for the updated drafts to be posted within the next two  weeks.  23 Oct 07:  The updated draft versions of the SOW and SRD have  been posted.  06 Nov 07: The anticipated release date of the FINAL RFP for  this program is January 2008.  The Government will periodically release  (on PIXS) DRAFT documents that may be included in the solicitation between  now and the FINAL RFP release date.  It is the Government's intention to  release as many pieces of the DRAFT RFP as soon as possible.  The  Government will be conducting a second set of "one-on-one" industry day  meetings from 3 Dec 07 through 7 Dec 07.  Please send an email to  kraig.neer@wpafb.af.mil to schedule an industry day question and answer  period.  The sessions will be scheduled on a first-come-first-served  basis.  14 Nov 07: DRAFT versions of Section M and Section L of the RFP  have been posted below.  Industry Week meetings are intended to ensure  interested bidders have a clear and complete understanding of the  Government's requirements.  "Requirements" in this context reflect the  total RFP requirements for proposal submittal and program execution, not  just the SRD.  The Government is also interested in understanding  Industry's perceptions of the program cost, schedule, and performance  risks associated with the RFP requirements.  Consistent with these two  goals, the Government will entertain suggestions to revise, clarify, or  simplify/streamline the requirements in the RFP documents.  We encourage  the provision of these suggestions in an electronic form in advance of the  Industry Week meetings, with the intent of facilitating productive  discussions during the meetings.  Offerors are encouraged NOT to use the  limited meeting time to "test" the Government's reactions to possible  requirements solutions or approaches.  The Government's responses to such  inquiries will be limited to non-evaluative discussion.  Capability  briefings related to an offeror's specific training simulation technology  capabilities across similar applications should be scheduled with the 677  AESG engineering leadership outside of the context of this  olicitation.  -------- 20 Nov 07: Posted the Non-Disclosure Agreement for  the AFRL Mission Essential Competencies (MECs).  All Contractors  participating in the Industry Week from 3 to 7 December should fill out  this NDA and submit it to the Government at their Industry Day Meeting  time.  The MECs will be available for viewing after the NDA is signed. For more information on "F-16 MTC Follow-On", please refer to:  https://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=5181

PMS NSW intends to use the information, with other information considered as well, to conduct further market research and product analysis.  It is anticipated that solicitation for products and/!  or services will be issued as a result of this market research for Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) equipment and designs for integration into the SWCS program.  PMS NSW reserves the right to hold additional market research meetings, including system demonstrations (if necessary), with some, but not necessarily all firms responding to this notice.  The preferred approach at this time is to leverage COTS equipment and systems to the maximum extent possible.  PMS NSW is also open to alternative solutions and minimal development items with value added potential. The SWCS will launch and recover from surface vessels and from submerged host platforms. The planned submerged launch and recovery platform is the Dry Deck Shelter (DDS) mounted external to a nuclear submarine host platform aft of the sail.  The DDS space available is 8 feet diameter by 22 feet long from the sphere operator station to the apex of the elliptical outer door.  A proposed extension in length of the DDS from 22 usable feet of storage space up to 32 feet is possible.  No extension to the DDS is the most preferred option, minimizing the extension is the next preference, and an extension to the full 32 feet is least preferred.  The SWCS will have to be loaded, manned, and maintained while enclosed in the DDS.  The SWCS is intended to operate manned with a crew of two and a dedicated cargo area exceeding 180 cubic feet (approx. twice the available cargo volume of the MK8 MOD1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle) for transport of SOF personnel and equipment to mission areas.  The c!  rew will navigate the vehicle submerged while wearing Underwater Breathing Apparatus? (UBA) for primary life support, additionally, the SWCS will have a vehicle mounted closed/semi-closed breathing system to provide extended duration.  The vehicle will be equipped with; precision navigation, internal and external communications, obstacle avoidance and docking sonar systems, multi-axis integrated auto-pilot, life support, and modular sensor systems.  The SWCS will provide increased personnel and cargo capacities, range, speed, and endurance over existing MK8 MOD1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle while maintaining the ability to operate clandestinely in shallow restrictive waters. Improvement areas pertaining to near-term SWCS design efforts include but are not limited to the following areas: hull form and design, active and passive vehicle enhancements for diver thermal protection (hot and cold), secure VHF/UHF/SATCOM and hydro-acoustic communication, human systems integration and training, control and display systems, sonar systems, three dimensional obstacle avoidance and navigation display for improved situational awareness, open architecture designs, common non-proprietary systems, reliability, alternative material construction, submerged navigation improvement systems, design integration, system integration analysis, high capacity alternative power sources and/or storage, alternative underwater propulsion methods, payload and mission package development, automated system failure identification and diagnostic, automatic piloting and ballasting, and alternative methods and platforms for vehicle launch and recovery.  Logistic areas of interest incl!  ude: process improvement strategies, obsolescence management, document management systems that allow for improved information sharing with applicable safeguards, user-friendly features, efficient methods of configuration control, efficient parts tracking methods and identification, commonality of parts and repair tools, simplified technical and repair manuals, simplified customer feedback process, training methodology changes, training requirements identification. Responses to this RFI should discuss: a.	Capabilities, benefits, concepts for new systems, upgrades to known fielded systems, integration concerns, developmental issues and most recent demonstrations, potential mission or capability relevance, system reliability (Mean Time Between Failure), supply and support requirements, anticipated future support, implementation timeline, potential annual production capability,  and line item breakdown of ownership cost estimates.   b.	List any customers that procured your product(s).  List results and parameters of any field tests and compatibility with other systems and software.  Briefly discuss your vision and plans for insertion of technology enhancements for the product offered.  Include why PMS NSW should be interested in your product  and discuss your firm?s direct and relevant experience in design, development and/or manufacturing.   c.	Identify your firm?s strategy for integration of COTS equipment and systems.  For your products currently operational (both public and private) provide references and customer points of contact.  In addition, provide whether your product is offered on the General Services Administration?s Federal Supply Schedule.  Identify which contract line items make up your system with corresponding price data.  If applicable, state whether your product will operate with known commercial software systems (1) without modification, (2) with minor modification or (3) not as currently offered.  If available provide copies of any evaluations of your product conducted by outside, independent organizations.  The point of contact for this Request for Information (RFI) is Mr. Dennis Lynch at 202-406-1317.

Antennas shall be unobtrusive (such as coaxial cable in wire molding) that will be affixed to walls and around doorways where required.  Installation shall be in accordance with industry-accepted practice and shall make the cabling as unobtrusive as possible.   This solicitation will be issued using FAR Part 12 and 13.5, Test program for Certain Commercial Items.  Evaluation and award will be based on best value and will include technical capability and suitability for the intended use, past performance and price.

NASA Cooperate Agreement Notice NNH07ZDA002C entitled "Education and Public Outreach Division Support Groups" is postponed until further notice. No proposals are solicited at this time. This CAN requested proposals for Division Support Groups in Education and Public Outreach (EPO) which would: (1) be responsible for the coordination of NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) content produced by missions and other projects to increase coherence and leverage efforts, (2) support integration and coordination of EPO activities within and across SMD Science Divisions, and (3) support education and science community access to SMD content. A total of $3.5M per year was set aside for this with a clear expectation of dividing this funding among four selected groups, one group for each SMD Science Division. SMD is re-evaluating its entire EPO program. The rescission of this solicitation does not mean the importance of this work has been devalued, only that SMD is carefully assessing its efforts so that the use of NASA funds in the EPO effort can be made more effective. After the reassessment is complete, a new solicitation for EPO support may be issued. SMD will convene an EPO working group to assess the need for EPO support activities with respect to the other EPO efforts and directions the community and NASA believe are most needed at this time. SMD cannot make this decision until it decides how much effort to put into the various EPO areas: informal vs. formal, elementary and secondary education vs. college and beyond, etc. This decision-making will include community input. Questions may be addressed to Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, Senior Advisor for Research and Analysis, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC 20546-0001; Telephone: (202) 358-1182; E-mail: sara@nasa.gov.

<DESC>AMENDMENT TO RESPONSE DATE: Changed from 7 Dec 2008 to 7 Dec 2007


This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to determine potential sources capable of performing studies to address programmatic and technical aspects related to the US Global Hawk Block 40 and the Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS). 

AGS will be a NATO-owned and operated system that will provide continuous, unrestricted, unfiltered Wide Area surveillance information from a stand-off position in all weather conditions for use at the political, strategic, operational and tactical level of decision-making in NATO and in the NATO nations. 
The acquisition of the NATO AGS system will be comprised of two phases, the Design, Development and Demonstration (D3) and the Production/O&S phase.

In 2004 NATO made a down-select to a mixed fleet solution proposed by a joint venture including Northrop Grumman and based on a manned Airbus aircraft and the Northrop Grumman Global Hawk (GH) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).  The manned aircraft was deleted from the program in mid-2007 because of affordability issues and NATO is now pursuing an AGS solution based on the Northrop Grumman-produced Global Hawk with the Multi-Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program (MP-RTIP) sensor.  

The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify potential highly competitive firms for a set of risk reduction activities.  The selected contractor will provide necessary products and information that will: define the NATO AGS Core Capability resulting from a UAV only based approach, present interdependency between ongoing related USAF program and NATO potential reuse technology candidates, draft the interoperability approach, and assist in drafting  the system Concept of Operations.  Additionally, the selected contractor shall provide acquisition strategies to identify and mitigate any impacts to the USAF RQ-4 Block 40 program and lower the risk of the NATO AGS program execution. 

Any information submitted by respondents to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought request.  The Government requests interested offerors submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the key features discussed above and the screening criteria below. Responses should include examples of systems successfully developed.  The Government expects that interested sources should meet the following criteria:

 (1) Possess or have the ability to obtain a U.S. Secret clearance as well as NATO Secret access.

(2)  Have demonstrated experience in studies and analysis of complex airborne ground surveillance systems.   

(3) Have previous experience in executing studies and risk reduction efforts on behalf of NATO and the US Government.  

(4) Have demonstrated experience with NATO ISR concepts and initiatives. 

(5) Have familiarity with NATO military requirements for airborne ground surveillance.

(6) Indicate your business size (Large or Small) as it applies to the NAICS Code 541990)

Interested parties who respond with their intention to be a potential offeror will be screened against the above criteria to identify highly competitive firms.  Responses must be submitted via CD ROM with two hard copies to the following address:  

Electronics Systems Center
(ATTN:  Ms Kimberlene Butler)
75 Vandenberg Drive, Bldg 1630
Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2119

Responses must be submitted in a Microsoft Word 2007 or higher format no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, 7 Dec 2007, and should not exceed 3, one-sided, 8.5 X 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes. The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.     THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.     REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.     The 423rd Contracting Flight is conducting market research to determine the existence of potential business sources to develop and deliver a critical thinking course of instruction using argument mapping as a teaching method.  

Foundation Thoughts:  
-	Innovation in all-source analysis can work along many vectors.  Information technology, organizational structure, socio-cultural dynamics, ergonomics, and various forms of cognitive enhancement can all compel profound and observable improvements in the process and quality of analytical content.
-	Often times, a return to fundamentals can provide insight and value.  Critical Thinking is a necessary, critical, core skill which should be understood and, ideally, mastered before any intelligence-specific analytical toolset is approached.
-	The definition of ?Critical Thinking? is lacking in consensus,  but at the minimum a definition would reflect the following actions: 

o	Creating. Generating new ideas, products, or ways of viewing things
Designing, constructing, planning, producing, inventing.
o	Evaluating. Justifying a decision or course of action
Checking, hypothesising, critiquing, experimenting, judging.
o	Analyzing.  Breaking information into parts to explore understandings and relationships. Comparing, organising, deconstructing, interrogating, finding.
o	Applying. Using information in another familiar situation. Implementing, carrying out, using, executing.
 
-	Recent scholarship has demonstrated that Argument Mapping, as a pedagogical technique, has driven improvement in critical thinking skills (as measured with the California Critical Thinking Skills Test.). 
-	All intelligence assessments have a bottom line.  Every bottom line is a judgment. Every judgment is the conclusion.  These conclusions drive belief or action.  Facility in argument will improve facility in analysis.
-	This COI is intended to focus intensively on Argument Mapping as a technique to teach Critical Thinking, and then to use student comments, lessons learned, and best practices from the course to decide whether there is sufficient value added to sustain.

Actions/Course Objectives:
-	Introduce Argument Mapping as a practical and useable method to improve 
            critical thinking skills and produce better intelligence analysis.
-	Develop mastery in the basic Argument Mapping lexicon, tools, and techniques
-	Introduce advanced Argument Mapping techniques and provide resources and trajectory for follow-on study
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument construction (aggregation) and graphic display [core competency]
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument deconstruction (disaggregation) and graphic display
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of specified formal and informal logical fallacy identification. Critical fallacies to focus upon will be determined at a later date.
-	Inspire students to continue practice and application of Argument Mapping in their work. 
-	35 contact hours delivered to 12-15 students

Compulsory Vendor Attributes:
-	Staffed by PhD-level philosophers with specific background in formal and symbolic logic, Philosophy/History of Science, Epistemology, and Argument Mapping theory and practice (to include IT-enablement)
-	Able to provide examples of past performance through testimonial, quantitative metrics, or references.
-	Has high fidelity understanding of all-source intelligence analysis and exposure to multiple interpretations of the Intelligence Cycle.
-	Has experience in teaching, consulting, writing, and research on the application of Enterprise 2.0 culture and enabling technologies on all-source intelligence knowledge generation.
-	Familiarity with the overall state of Critical Thinking scholarship

Request for Comment               
Sources Sought/Request for Capabilities Statements
With over 600,000 pilots operating more than 200,000 aircraft from approximately 19,000 airports and landing strips throughout the country, the General Aviation (GA) segment of aviation alone represents a large population of aviation operations. Due to the breadth and diversity that exists within the aviation mode of transportation, it has become necessary to better understand and gain situational awareness of the aircraft operation within National Airspace System (NAS). This increased awareness will allow TSA and other Federal, State. And local entities to better manage potential threats and prioritize tracks of interest.  

TSA seeks to find a technical solution for providing real-time flight data of all aircraft, regardless of the type of operation, including aircraft operator information, routing, historical data recording (and playback mechanism) in order to spot anomalies and enhance the government?s situational awareness of the operations occurring in the (NAS). 

??	The contractor shall provide TSA with the software, hardware (if 				applicable), and data feeds from its systems directly to TSA HQ, 				Operation Center, and have a mobility/flexibility feature that 				allows authorized TSA personnel to access the information, in a 				secure manner, from an outside locations (i.e. home, personal 				computer).  The system shall have the capability to 						integrate/interoperate with the TSA/FAA ADAPT system to 				provide the most current and effective situational awareness 				overview of the NAS from a common operating picture.  At a 				minimum the system should feed data, regarding the following 				items listed below, to the TSA locations (above):
?	Monitor various types of air traffic operating with in 				the NAS and abroad
?	Positively identify the aircraft using various 						techniques (i.e. tail number)
?	Attempt to positively link the pilot with the aircraft
?	Provide current and pertinent contact information 					for the target aircraft in question
?	Capability of recording past flight information 					(including routes of flight, origins, destinations, 					intermediate stops, and ownership/operator 						information)
?	Interoperate or be integrated into the existing 					ADAPT system
?	Track/monitor all traffic (aircraft operators cannot 					select to participate, as witnessed in various COTS 					solutions)

??	The contractor shall develop and submit for TSA approval, a 				written plan (in hard-copy and Microsoft Office electronic format) 				for implementation of the activities outlined above one (1) 					month after contract award.  This implementation plan shall detail:
?	Specific activities that are to be conducted to meet 					TSA requirements
?	Planned travel
?	Technology system architecture
?	IT systems to be installed at TSA facilities
?	How the IT system will integrate, coexist, and 					interoperate with existing TSA systems
?	Specific timeline for accomplishment 

??	The contractor shall provide to TSA a monthly progress report, 				commencing from date of award.  The monthly progress Report 				shall include:
?	Status of meeting objectives and deliverables
?	Status of meeting timelines
?	Cost figures allocated to past performance and 					projected cost for completing outstanding 						objectives/deliverables 
?	Summary of significant accomplishments
?	Draft comprehensive report document development 					status
?	Any issues that need attention

??	The Contractor shall be responsible for establishing and 					maintaining working relationships with all stakeholders, including, 			but not limited to, the GA community, related trade associations, 				international aviation/security organizations, and Federal 					authorities.  

??	Any equipment used for collecting data shall be provided and 				installed by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall use technology 				that is compatible with industry and government standards.

??	Sensitive Security Information (SSI) as prescribed by 49 CFR 				1520 that is collected or produced in completing these objectives 				will be treated in accordance with TSA?s Interim Sensitive 					Security Information (SSI) Policies and Procedures for 					Safeguarding and Control.


The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential bidders based on capability statements.
Responses to this RFI shall include:
1.	A Capability Statement, including
a.	A suggested timeline and milestones for the effort
b.	Indication of business size status
Submissions are restricted to no more than ten (10) pages in length.

Offerors in their capability statement should describe at a minimum their expertise and experience in efforts related or similar to those described in the Statement of Work.  Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, company web site, size of firm, number of years providing representative research and analysis work, and direct points of contact including phone and e-mail addresses.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.     Additionally, the Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  The results of this RFI will be used in the development of the final Request for Proposal, and will be used in assembling a bidders list to which the final RFP will be sent.
TSA intends to either set aside this effort as a small business limited competition or establish it as an 8(a) set-aside. However, should no qualified small business respond to this RFI, this effort would be opened to large businesses.    
All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than December 3, 2007 to the following email address: Audrey.Taylor@dhs.gov.  Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services.

<SUBJECT>58--Sources Sought for Sonar Transmitter MK 87

<CONTACT>Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140, or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Announcement.  The Navy intends to procure sonar transmitters used to identify the location of underwater objects, primarily exercise and training (inert) sea mines delivered (dropped) from high-speed, fixed-wing aircraft. The specifications for previously procured sonar transmitters can be requested as references (1-6)from Philip.c.davis@navy.mil.  The Navy has previously purchased sonar transmitters with performance and physical characteristics being described in WS 13679 (series).  WS 13679 Rev. J(reference 1), WS 13659/4 Rev B (reference 2), and WS 13679/5 Rev. B (reference 3) describe acoustic (acoustic intensity, pulse duration and period, beam pattern, and days-of-life) and environmental performance standards (pressure, shock, vibration, temperature, and corrosion resistance), and physical characteristics (size, shape, marking, case material, spanner wrench hole patterns, etc.) of sonar transmitters previously procured. The Navy now intends to procure sonar transmitters that substantially comply with the widely-adopted Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration performance standard for similar devices installed on aircraft, Technical Standard Order (TSO) C121, Underwater Locating Devices (Acoustic) (Self-Powered) (reference 4), commercial standards cited by TSO-C121 (copyrighted and therefore not included in this statement), and the Navy Technical Manual for Batteries, Navy Lithium Battery Safety Program, Responsibilities and Procedures, S9310-AQ-SAF-010, 19 August 2004 (reference 5).  Desired sonar transmitter characteristics that differ from TSO-C121, or are in addition to TSO-C121 will later be identified in a separate Navy technical drawing or performance specification. The current generation of Sonar Transmitter Mk 87, the Mods 3 and 4, has a unique capability to simultaneously transmit an 8.5-9.5 kHz acoustic signal in addition to the 35-40 kHz signal typical of this type of device in aircraft applications.  The sonar transmitters planned for procurement will not require an 8.5-9.5 kHz signal. The Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 Mod 4 includes a delay-transmit function, which would delay the transmitter operation for 1, 4, 6, 8, and 32 days being the transmitter is submerged in water.  The time-delay feature is implemented in a ?delay cap,? a replacement of the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 Mod 3 ?end-cap/water switch,? as described in Figures 1 and 2 of both WS 13679/4 Rev B and WS 13679/5 Rev B.   The programmable delay feature is also required in the sonar transmitter that is planned for procurement.  However, it is necessary that the delay feature be implemented within the basic shape and dimensions (length and diameter) of the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 Mod 3.  This is necessary for the sonar transmitter to fit in existing holders used for aircraft-delivered exercise and training sea mines. The sonar transmitter shall have a flat water switch insulator and recessed water switch pin, as depicted in Figure 1 of WS 13679/4 Rev. B.  (Acoustic beacons in aircraft applications typically have a convex insulator and a water switch pin flush or proud of the insulator to prevent beacon activation due to condensation.) Underwater locating devices used in aircraft application are typically made of aluminum.  The sonar transmitter will be repeatedly exposed to sea water during its service life. Therefore, the sonar transmitter case shall be constructed of highly corrosion resistant steel, UNS 31603 (316 low-carbon). The sonar transmitter shall use the same pre-formed packing (o-rings) currently used in the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87, SAE-AS29513-023.  The sonar transmitter shall, if applicable, use the same screw as the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87, Mods 3 and 4, 0.60-80UNF x.125L, as depicted on Figure 2 of WS 13679/4. The sonar transmitter shall have a maximum operating depth of 2,000 feet, significantly less that the 20,000 feet operating depth typical of similar devices in aircraft applications. To prevent the accidental installation of Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 water-switch caps, battery caps, or delay caps, the sonar transmitter shall have a spanner wrench hole pattern different from that of the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 Mod 3 and 4.    To facilitate compliance with the Navy lithium battery performance standards, S9310-AQ-SAF-010, the sonar transmitter shall use one single cell battery, presumably of lithium chemistry.   Testing in accordance with S9310-AQ-SAF-010 specifically includes the requirement that the sonar transmitter case and packings withstand an internal pressure equal to at least twice that exhibited during lithium battery discharging and reverse charging tests as described in S9310-AQ-SAF-010.  The sonar transmitter and battery will require certification for use aboard U.S. Navy submarines, as described in S9310-AQ-SAF-010. The battery shall be polarized (with a collar installed on one end that is larger than the battery diameter), to prevent the backwards installation of the battery.  NAVSEA Drawing 57311-6916014 (reference 6), depicting the battery used in the Sonar Transmitter Mk 87 Mods 3 and 4, is included as an example of a polarity collar. The sonar transmitter will be used repeatedly during its service life, generally with a new battery installed for each use.  The cost of batteries will be a significant component in the total service life cost of the transmitter, and therefore will be a significant factor in selecting a sonar transmitter for procurement. The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential suppliers of sonar transmitters, to determine expected performance characteristics, and to determine an approximate, estimated unit cost of the sonar transmitter and batteries. Interested firms shall respond with brief documentation showing the company's ability to fulfill the requirement described above. Only prime contractors should respond.  A list of responding prime contractors will be furnished to potential subcontractors upon request.  This is not a solicitation, however the Navy may proceed with a solicitation to procure 500 to 2000 transmitters, with an expected contract award within Fiscal Year 2008 (ending 30 September 2008).  In the event that a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published in the FEDBIZOPS.   Responses requested within 30 days.  Direct expression of interest as well as required documentation should be addressed in writing to Mr. Philip C. Davis, philip.c.davis@navy.mil, (850) 234-4742. NAICS Code:  334511;  Size Std:  500 employees;  FSC Code:  5845.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) on behalf of the United States Marshall Service (USMS), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement. Currently, no solicitation is available. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.     

USMS, ICE, and OFDT have determined an anticipated growth of 2,500 to 3,000 prisoners within the next 5 to 8 months in the area of Tucson, Arizona.  We project this growth to last a minimum of 24 months. The growth would be misdemeanor cases being housed for 30-60 days, which would not require ?high? security.  

 

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified commercial or government sources that would be able to provide bed space to fulfill this requirement.  Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.   

 

After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in the FedBizOpps.  All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

 

OFDT is in search of existing or planned secured detention facility located in Arizona, New Mexico, or Southern California.  The requirement will include secure transportation services to and from the Tucson, Arizona areas. 

 

The contractor shall provide comprehensive detention services for the safe, secure, and humane confinement for a population principally consisting of prisoners or detainees charged with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on immigration status, or deportation. Services are to be provided in the contractor owned or a leased detention/correctional facilities.

 
Potential vendors should submit facilities they wish the government to consider.  Information at minimum should be facility size; security level; any and all accreditations; location; name and address of firm; size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged; number of years in business; affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact name, address, and phone number).

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. All responses shall be submitted to Anthony H. Bigesby, Supervisory Contract Specialist, OFDT, 4601 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 910, Arlington, VA 22203 or via e-mail at Anthony.Bigesby@usdoj.gov, no later than December 15, 2007.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE RESPONSES TO A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) IN SUPPORT OF THE IDAHO CLEANUP PROJECT'S CALCINE DISPOSITION PROJECT. 
CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  CWI is seeking qualified businesses with thorough knowledge, experience and resources, who are interested in receiving and responding to a to a Request for Information (RFI) regarding proposed methods of calcine treatment.
**Background:  From 1952 to 1992, the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies reprocessed spent nuclear reactor fuel at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant, located on the Snake River Plain in southeast Idaho. This facility, now known as the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center (INTEC), is part of the Idaho National Lab (INL) Site. Processing operations at INTEC utilized multiple cycles of solvent extraction to recover uranium-235 and other defense-related materials from spent nuclear reactor fuel.  These reprocessing activities, as well as other ancillary facility activities and operations, generated millions of gallons of liquid radioactive wastes which were stored in the INTEC Tank Farm Facility (TFF) in eleven large (300,000-gallons each) underground storage tanks.  These tank wastes are regulated as a mixed radioactive waste under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) due to their hazardous constituents.  A fluidized bed calcination process was put in operation in the early 1960s to convert the liquid tank waste into small, granular solids called calcine.  The calcination process produced a safer product for storage while reducing the volume of stored waste by an average factor of seven.  Approximately eight million gallons of tank waste were converted to 4,400 cu. m. of calcine and pneumatically transferred to the Calcined Solids Storage Facility (CSSF) at INTEC where it is currently stored awaiting future disposition.  ------The Record of Decision (ROD) for the 'Idaho High-Level Waste & Facilities Disposition Final Environmental Impact Statement' DOE/EIS-0287, provided for a dual path for calcine. The dual-path ROD describes the actions necessary to dispose at a Monitored Geological Repository (MGR) of containerized calcine without further treatment, and also describes the actions necessary to dispose of calcine treated by a specific selected treatment option in the event that regulatory issues associated with untreated calcine (direct disposal) cannot be mitigated. -----

In such event, the specific treatment option will be selected from one of the three treatment alternatives listed herein:  (a) steam reforming, (b) hot isostatic press (HIP), or (c) vitrification. An amended ROD will be issued by December 31, 2009 which will provide a dual path of direct disposal and selected treatment option. Based on the outcome of the regulatory process, an amended ROD will be issued by December 31, 2011 which will make final selection between direct disposal method versus the selected treatment option from the 2009 ROD. ----

CWI has completed a conceptual design to retrieve and package calcine without treatment (direct disposal) to support the 2009 and 2011 amended RODS. 

***The purpose of the subsequent Request for Information (RFI) packet is to solicit vendor input, design concepts, data, and information which will be assembled and evaluated during the selection process for the 2009 ROD and to support the 2011 ROD.  ***The RFI packet will be sent to each respondent who expresses interest to this sources sought notice for the opportunity to provide proposed design concepts, data, and information for their respective calcine treatment process. Additionally, if one of the treatment options is selected in the 2011 ROD, respective respondent(s) to the RFI shall be included on the solicitation list for a future resultant subcontract to provide some or all of the following in support of the Calcine Disposition Project:  Design; Equipment; Construction; Operations; Supporting Services; Licensing and Regulatory Support.
 
This announcement is not a solicitation***  This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify sources interested in receiving the complete RFI packet (which is too large to publish online)  It is anticipated the RFI will be issued in January 2008.  ***Brokers should not respond***  Only business/team entities capable of providing the full scope of design and service shall respond to this announcement.***
Interested companies shall submit their expression of interest in receiving the RFI packet VIA EMAIL to  david.macdonald@icp.doe.gov NO LATER THAN 4:00 p.m. MST on DECEMBER 12, 2007 **** 
INCLUDE IN YOUR EMAIL RESPONSE: 1) company name  2) company size/socioeconomic classification  3) contact name  4) phone  5) fax  6) email 7) identify the treatment method (a,b,c) your company intends to propose 8) statement of applicable past experience

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 
After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Those companies who do meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

For those companies that meet the requirements above and the criteria below under Technical/Company Criteria, the CPT will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting.  However, the Government reserves the right to invoke evaluations in an inpatient setting.

2.	The MTFs will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement using a zero to seven rating scale. Zero is equal to not acceptable and seven is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all products.  All clinical criteria are weighted equally. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 3.75 is a target acceptability threshold.  The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.75 depending on the "break" in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75.  Below this threshold, products will be unacceptable clinically and not eligible for consideration for standardization and will not be considered further

3.	After the clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the
clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer representing a discount from their DAPA pricing based on a minimum committed volume of 80% of the total requirements for MTFs in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Vendors that fail to offer pricing that is discounted from their DAPA pricing will be eliminated from further consideration.  Vendor Product and Price Proposals will be in the Excel template provided by the government.  The vendors will provide their completed Excel template by email to Bob.Meinertzhagen@med.navy.mil.

Pricing responses must be received by 4:00 P.M. fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the request is initiated by the TRBO.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration.

Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the offers become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important

     The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria with pricing being least important.  A multiple award is a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region.

Technical/Company Criteria:

The CPT will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for the purpose of evaluation of the technical criteria means the responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: (1) the vendor  offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the  vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the product line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community in which such products and/or services are applicable; (3) the vendor has a DAPA for the product line, products and/or services; (4) the vendor has a commercial agreement covering the product line, products and/or services with Owens and Minor, the Prime Vendor for the region ; (5) the vendor intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the  vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

1.	You are required to provide a full line of reusable patient apparel to include, but not limited to, pajamas (tops & bottoms), robes, and gowns.
2.	Your reusable patient apparel products must be available through the regional Prime Vendor, Owens & Minor.
3.	You are required to provide your DAPA Number.

The DX provides a centralized, quick, and expert response for all cost engineering requests from the COE, the Department of Energy (DOE), other Department of Defense, or Federal agencies.  The DX establishes teams to complete tasks using individuals from other COE Districts, the Walla Walla District Cost Engineering Branch, a nd the private sector through Architect Engineer contracts. Scope.  Professional, multi-discipline, cost engineering services include, but are not limited to, cost engineering, cost estimating, risk analysis, program and project management, planning and scheduling, cost and schedule performance measurement and chan ge control, and value engineering. These services are required to support the COE Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste and  Military and Civil Works Program, as well as support the COE in sponsorship with other agencies such as, but not limited to, Department of Energy and its subdivisio ns of environmental restoration, waste management, decontamination and decommissioning, Office of Site Service, and Office of River Protection.  Cost engineering services may be required from COE Districts throughout the United States.  The scope also requ ires the A-E to complete work using the COEs estimating software MII, COE and DOE work breakdown structure, activity based estimating techniques, baseline cost estimating, risk analysis, critical analysis and scheduling techniques, and other related skill s.  The Walla Walla District COE will administer the contract.  Proposals will be evaluated on professional qualifications, experience, and the firms capabilities to provide cost engineering services from the planning phases through final project completion. Detailed evaluation criteria will be specified in the RFP.  T he RFP is anticipated to be issued in January 2008.   To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov. USACE is submitting the sources sought to determine industry interest in the project.  Interested firms should indicate their interest to the Ms. Jani Long at Jani.c.long@usace.army.mil as soon as possible, but no later than 10 calendar days from the poste d date of this notice.

<DESC>TESTING LABORATORIES FOR CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL ANALYSES--SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  This announcement is to solicit interest for the establishment of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with small businesses.  The NAICS solicited is 541380  Testing La boratories.  The small business size standard for NAICS 541380 is $11.0 million.  The BPAs duration will be for a period of one (1) year and may be extended in one (1) year increments, not to exceed 5 years.  The tests to be performed and the test methods  to be used are as shown on Table 1 (Attachment A).  The establishment of BPAs does not imply any agreement by the Government to place future contracts or orders with the BPA holders.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of calls or act ual amount of work to be ordered.  The establishment of BPAs does not justify purchasing from only one source.  The Government intends to award multiple BPAs for this requirement.  Price reasonableness will be determined by competing BPA calls among BPA ho lders.  If, for a particular purchase greater than the micro-purchase threshold, there is an insufficient number of BPAs to ensure maximum practicable competition, the Contracting Officer shall solicit quotations from other sources and make the purchase as  appropriate.  Orders may be placed for USAERDC, Environmental Chemistry Branch, Vicksburg, MS.  BPA holders will be selected based on successful past performance of same/similar services, and business experience.  Responses to this announcement must inclu de past performance information and business experience to include contact names, addresses, phone numbers, contract numbers, as well as a description of the services provided.   Past Performance Questionnaire  For all contacts identified, a Past Performa nce Questionnaire must be completed and submitted.   Past Performance Questionnaire is available upon request by email.  Point of contact is Cynthia Sims at Cynthia.L.Sims@mvk02.usace.army.mil.  A solicitation will not be issued.   Responses to this announ cement must be received not later than 28 November 2007, 4:00 p.m. central standard time, to be considered.  All respondents must have an active registration at Central Contractor Registration www.ccr.gov.  Responses shall be mailed to Cynthia Sims, USAED,  ERDC Contracting Office, Vicksburg, 4155 Clay Street, Vicksburg, MS  39183-3435.  Facsimile offers shall not be accepted.

NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 08-001

Title: 	Superconformal Electrodeposition Of Ni-Fe-Co Magnetic Alloys***

Description: The invention deals with the challenge of void-free filling of recessed surface features on non-planar metallized surfaces with iron group magnetic materials. Specifically, the addition of certain benzimidazole derivatives to a conventional additive-free nickel plating baths, e.g. Watts bath NiS04-NiCli, results in a superconformal deposition growth mode. By superconformal deposition we mean that metal deposition occurs preferentially in recessed surface features, such as patterned trenches and vias, thereby resulting in void-free filling. By appropriate patterning and design a variety of fully consolidated 3-D shapes and geometries can be fabricated. The resulting structures have potential use as micromagnets for microelectromechanical devices as well as active magnetic material components for use in a variety of information storage devices. The process may also be useful in the deposition of Ni and related metals as a precursor to forming silcide contacts in microelectronics.

<SUBJECT>--Advertising for the Tennessee Army National Guard.
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Learfield Communications, Incorporated. This company's physical address is 505 Hobbs Road, Jefferson City, Missouri, 65109-1088. The award will be made for the purchase of a signage package ad vertising the Tennessee Army National Guard. This marketing effort will concentrate on marketing activities with the University of Memphis Basketball team during the 2007-2008 basketball season. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 6.302-1, f or Other than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that  competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements. The point of contact for this announcement is John W. Anders, Contracting Specialist, at john.anders@ng.army.mil.  The following MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD has been issued for this req uirement.  SUBJECT:  Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (Number: JA-TN-0002) 1.This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the University of Memphiss Basketball prog ram.  The recommended vendor to fulfill this requirement is the company of, Learfield Communications, Incorporated.  This company is under contract with the University Of Memphis for marketing activities for the fiscal year 2008 basketball season.  The Ten nessee Army National Guard would like to use this company to market them during the home games for the fiscal year 2008 basketball season.  This kind of concept for this particular venue is not otherwise available to the Government. 2. In an effort to incr ease the number of people enlisting in the  Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) on a game day representatives from the TNARNG shall be allowed to set up a Game Day display in order to educate spectators about the opportunities available in the Tennessee  Army National Guard. 3.The total estimated value of this advertising package shall not exceed $20,000.00. 4.The Statutory Authority as noted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 is satisfied based on the fact that there is only one responsib le source for fulfilling this requirement in the vicinity of Memphis Tennessee, and that there are no other supplies or services that will satisfy the agency requirements for this particular requirement. 5.	The University of Memphis is the largest collegia te Basketball team in West Tennessee and is the only sports organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit.  6. Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the University of Memphis is the only collegiate team in the West Tennessee for this particular venue capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee  Army National Guard wishes to recruit. 7. The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertisement packages of this nature. The price proposed for the University of Memphis is $20,0 00.00 with an anticipated attendance per game of 14,000 people. Similar packages were sold at the University Of Tulsa, OK for $17,000.00 which had an average attendance per game of 5,000 people, and also at the University of Texas A&M for a total cost of $ 35,000.00 with an average attendance of 10,000 people per game. 8. Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541850 for Display Adv ertising in Tennessee. No other sports teams in the West Tennessee area were identified in this search that could provide an advertisement package  as required for this particular requirement except for, Learfield Communications, Incorporated. 9. Learfield Communications, Incorporated is the only responsible source identified in the market research that could provide an advertising package of this ty pe in the West Tennessee area. 10. Based upon the market research conducted by this office there were no other sources that could have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11. No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Univers ity of Memphis is only collegiate basketball team in West Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demographic group for potential recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard. 12. In accordance with  the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15.403-1 (a) Cost or pricing data shall not be obtained for acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. 12. This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
FOR
DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY (DLA)
FORGING TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
NOVEMBER 13, 2007
________________________________________
POINT OF CONTACT: 	Mr.  John Dormer, Contracting Officer  
Defense Supply Center Philadelphia
DLA Contracting Support Office DSCO-P
700 Robbins Avenue, Building 36-2
Philadelphia, PA 19111

1.  BACKGROUND
The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is soliciting proposals for its forging technology research and development program to be jointly funded by the DLA and the Army.  The program seeks to demonstrate readiness improvements by developing and applying innovative methods of designing, manufacturing and buying weapons systems spare parts and components through advanced forging technologies.  Technical oversight of the projects selected for funding under this BAA shall be performed by DLA and the Army.  Subject to availability of funds, a total Government investment of about $15 million is planned during Fiscal Years 2008-2012 for funding efforts selected from this BAA.  Proposals for less than the total amount and shorter than the total duration will also be entertained.  The government is anticipating the award of cost sharing contracts.

2.  GENERAL PROPOSAL SUBMISSION INFORMATION
Proposers must submit an original and five (5) copies of full proposals and an electronic copy on a CD-ROM referring to BAA 0001-08 by 3:00 PM, local Philadelphia time on or before 28 December 2007 in order to be considered.  No additional information is available, nor shall a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same shall be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  This is an unrestricted acquisition.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DLA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA shall be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in forging technology.  Large Business concerns are required to submit a Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan.  For purposes of this acquisition, the size standard is 500 employees Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 3462.  All correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including request for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the POC at the top of the BAA; e-mail is preferred.  Proposals may NOT be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent shall be disregarded.  




3.  AREAS OF INTEREST
Areas of interest, in no particular order, include: (1) Rapid Tooling - identification and demonstration of manufacturing processes to produce rapid tooling for forged item prototyping.  Applications span the array of ?hand-held? sized forged items used in various military systems such as mortars, howitzers and tank cannon.  (2) Process Modeling ? identification and demonstration of forging process modeling technologies to optimize forging die design; process parameters to achieve fewer full scale iterative processing trials on such Army items as 60mm, 81mm and 120mm mortar baseplates.  (3) Predictive Performance ? the identification and demonstration of innovative modeling and simulation technologies to predict end (forged) item performance ? as applied to such Army items as howitzer and tank breech rings, breech blocks and tubes.  The projected benefit is substantially reduced costs for item qualification via modeling and simulation versus full scale firing testing.  (4) Alternative Materials ? identification and demonstration of advanced materials designed and optimized specifically for forge processing to improve item service life and sustainability.  Applications encompass most Army ground weapon systems. (5) Lean Six Sigma manufacturing demonstrations to reduce variability and waste in forging manufacture.  (6) Tools for technical data package review and modernization at Department of Defense Inventory Control Points. (7) Tools for evaluating and streamlining forging supply chains for best value supply source selection. (8) Multi-material, multi-method evaluation of various forging technologies for application-specific problems.  Offerors are encouraged to innovate and are not limited to proposing exactly these technology and application areas. DLA provides logistics support to all of the Military Services and is interested in all weapon system applications.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 


Closing date and time for receipt of offers is December 4, 2007, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about December 21, 2007. Contact Ewa Brown at ewa.k.brown@uscg.mil or 252-334-5407 for questions regarding this solicitation.  Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5240, or at the following address:

STATEMENT OF WORK for Complete preparation of C-141 flight control surfaces for static display

1.0   INTRODUCTION
The effective execution of this project requires proficiency in a unique combination of independent disciplines. The contractor should bring to this project a thorough understanding of aircraft repair procedures, parts handling and scrapping requirements.  In addition the contractor must have extensive working knowledge of radioactive materials management, radiation safety principles, and waste disposal.  Magenta Inc. possesses these capabilities for the preparation of the C-141 flight control surfaces for static display.  Magenta Inc. will provide the project management and will draw on its own extensive experience in radioactive materials management, health physics and radiation safety, depleted uranium (DU) aircraft counterweight disposition, waste disposal, and will provide an FAA licensed pilot and mechanic to supervise the removal of the counterweights and the installation of the specially approved dummy aluminum aileron static display counterweights.   An extra pair of tungsten aircraft counterweights previously procured by the Air Force has been made available for installation on the ailerons at no charge to the Government at Scott AFB. The Magenta Team has prepared ten ship sets of C-141 flight control surfaces for static display at Air Force Museums around the country.  The combination of possessing the necessary parts, specialized expertise and capabilities make the Magenta Team uniquely qualified to perform this work for Scott AFB. 

2.0   SCOPE OF WORK
ALC at Robins AFB will provide dummy counterweights fabricated of aluminum to the dimensional specifications of the DU parts from existing stocks at no charge.  The handling of the flight control surfaces, to include the removal of DU counterweights and installation of dummy counterweights will be supervised by an FAA licensed mechanic to insure that these operations are performed correctly and conform to the high standards of the commercial aviation industry.  The availability of experienced radiological staff and technicians, working under the direction of Magenta Inc. will ensure that the removal and disposal of DU counterweights are performed safely and in full compliance with applicable regulations. Magenta will provide DU counterweight transportation and disposal services to ensure the disposal of the removed C-141 counterweights is fully compliant with US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) Regulatory Issue Summary 2001-13.  

Scott AFB is responsible for coordinating the shipment of one C-141 left aileron to the facility in Clairton, PA. The right aileron and a pair of elevators are already stationed there.  The DU counterweights will be removed and replaced, on all flight control surfaces, with dummy aluminum counterweights for static display.  The DU counterweights will be packaged and disposed of at an authorized Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility.  The processed flight control surfaces will be shipped to Scott AFB.  

2.1  Receipt and storage of flight control surfaces 
Magenta Inc will manage the performance of the work on the flight control surfaces at Philotechnics, Ltd.?s facility located at: 600 State Street, Clairton, PA 15025.  The flight control surfaces will be unloaded and staged in a physically secure and protected area pending processing.

2.2  Material inventory, inspection and identification
Prior to removal of any counterweights, each flight control surface will be inspected under the supervision of an FAA licensed mechanic to document any unusual conditions, note any damaged parts, and list any missing parts or pieces.  A unique tracking number will be assigned to each flight control surface for work control and reporting purposes.

2.3  Recovery and replacement of counterweights
The flight control surfaces will be lifted and positioned in the work area by use of a hoist with a spreader lifting bar to preclude damage during handling of the units.  Depleted uranium counterweights will be removed from each flight control surface and transferred to an approved shipping container for transportation and disposal.  An FAA licensed aircraft mechanic will supervise the removal of the counterweights.  The accessible areas of the flight control surfaces adjacent to the counterweights locations will be cleaned by wiping and/or use of a HEPA vacuum to remove any depleted uranium oxide deposits.  The areas will then be verified as clean by the use of appropriate radiological survey instruments.  Accessible areas will be cleaned to the standard prescribed in USNRC Regulatory Guide 1.86, which is an average level of no more than 5,000 dpm &#945;/100cm2 (maximum 15,000 dpm &#945;/100 cm2) with no more than 1,000 dpm &#945;/100 cm2  removable. Aluminum dummy counterweights will be installed under the supervision of an FAA licensed aircraft mechanic on each flight control.  

2.4 Disposition of the flight control surfaces 
Flight control surfaces to be returned to the Air Force will be mounted in their prescribed special shipping containers and shipped to Scott AFB by a properly permitted common carrier. 

2.5  Disposal of depleted uranium counterweights 
The transportation and disposal of the removed DU counterweights will be at the U.S. Ecology facility at Grand View, Idaho, an RCRA disposal site authorized to accept certain excepted low-level radioactive wastes.  After contract completion, the work area will be cleaned and surveyed by qualified health physics technicians to ensure that remaining levels of DU contamination are below USNRC Regulatory Guide 1.86 free release criteria.

The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable proposal will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In evaluating an offerors past performance record, the Government will consider information in the offerors proposal and any information which may be obtained from other sources, including (as applicable) past and present customers and their employees; state and local agencies; other DoD components; other Federal Agencies; consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; other public agencies; private firms and former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information.

Tobyhanna Army Depot regulations regarding access, safety, and securi ty, are as follows:      SAFETY    1.  Tobyhanna Army Depot is an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) site. Tobyhanna Army Depot requires full contractor compliance with all applicable safety regulations and standards. The Contractor is responsible for maintaining, monitoring and enforcing full compliance. SECURITY: NON-RESIDENT/NON-IMMIGRANT ALIENS    a.  All non-resident/non-immigrant aliens must have approval prior to being permitted access to Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD). Such approval must be obtained by requesting access through the following: apply at the alien-residents embassy; proceed to the U.S. Embassy; proceed to the Department of the Army; p roceed to Army Materiel Command; proceed to U.S. Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command; proceed to TYAD.   b.  All non-resident/non-immigrant aliens granted access to TYAD are required to be escorted by Government personnel. One Governme nt escort can accommodate a maximum of two non-resident/non-immigrant aliens.   c.  Due to limited availability of Government personnel, contractors shall not be permitted to employ non-resident/non-immigrant aliens as part of the contractor s on-site work force. Limited exceptions to this restriction may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Such exceptions shall only be considered where a specialized skill or trade is not otherwise available, and even under such circumstances would only be considered for very limited duration, e.g., a few hours/days. However, even if limited exception is considered, access may still be denied. Contractors whose personnel are either denied entry to TYAD or permitted limited entry to TYAD due to the security requirements per taining to non-resident aliens/non-immigrants are not relieved of their obligation to provide the required contract performance and must do so at no additional cost to the Government. Any contractor failing to perform or that fails to perform in a timely m anner under such circumstances may be terminated for default or other contractual remedies as appropriate.   d.  Due to limited availability of Government personnel, visitors requiring escort may not be permitted access, or access may be limited to a certa in time and duration. SECURITY SEARCHES AND IN-PROCESSING All persons seeking entrance to TYAD must submit to and comply with all security standards and requirements in force at the time such persons are seeking entry. All visitors and contractors, regardl ess of resident status or citizenship, will be subject to vehicle search and intense in-processing by TYAD Security personnel prior to being granted access to TYAD. This security screening process may be time consuming and access may be delayed or denied.      CONTRACTOR ON-SITE WORKFORCE    A.  If a contractor intends to use resident aliens (immigrants) for on-site performance, then prior to the commencement of performance under the contract and within seven (7) workdays of contract award, the Contractor s hall submit to the Chief, Security Division, Tobyhanna Army Depot, a roster of all contractor personnel, inclusive of on-site supervisory or managerial personnel and sub-contractor personnel, that the Contractor anticipates will be performing work on-site.  T he roster shall indicate which individuals are U.S. citizens and which are resident aliens (immigrants). The following documentation shall accompany the roster for each individual named on the roster as a resident alien (immigrant): a) a copy of a verif iable form of identification, such as a drivers license or a passport; and b) a copy of a valid Department of Justice Immigration and Naturalization Service Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card (Green Card).   B. Within six (6) workdays of the subm ission of the roster and documentation, the Government will have completed the security check and the Contractor shall be notified whether all listed personnel will be permitted to work on-site. However, actual access to Tobyhanna Army Depot by the roster personnel will remain contingent upon such resident alien (immigrant) individuals presenting two (2) forms of identification as they process into the Depot through the Security building: a valid Form I-551, Alien Registration Receipt Card (Green Card ) in addition to at least one other verifiable form of identification.   C.  The roster which the Contractor submits is amendable. However, up to five (5) workdays w ill be required to perform a security check on any resident alien (immigrant) personnel added to the roster. The Contractor is urged to include contingency or back-up personnel in the original Roster in order to avoid delays due to Roster amendment.   D. C ontractors whose personnel are denied entry to TYAD due to the security requirements are not relieved of their obligation to provide the required contract performance and must do so at no additional cost to the Government. Any contractor failing to perform  or that fails to perform in a timely manner under such circumstances may be terminated for default or be subject to other contractual remedies as appropriate.   E. Contractors who fail to identify any and all resident aliens (immigrants) who will be used for on-site performance and who will seek access to Tobyhanna Army Depot as a worker for o r through the contractor, inclusive of managerial and subcontractor personnel, may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and sanctions as well as contract remed ies.   F. Notwithstanding the above requirements, Tobyhanna Army Depot reserves the right to require any contractor to submit an employee roster and to institute security screening of any contractor employees, inclusive of on-site supervisory or managerial  personnel and sub-contractor personnel that the Contractor anticipates will be performing work on-site, as determined necessary by the Depot Chief of Security.   G. While within the confines of Tobyhanna Army Depot, Contractor employees will adhere to and  be governed by all rules, regulations, policies, procedures and directives issued by the Commanding Officer, Tobyhanna Army Depot, and said employees will be required to conduct themselves in the same manner required of Government employees.

If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.     Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.     Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.     All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency. 

All quotations must be received not later than 19 November 2007, 5:00 P.M. Local Time.     Quotations received after that date and time will not be considered.     Proposals may be submitted via FAX to 510-637-5978 Attn: Marilou M. Ponge or by email to Marilou.M.Ponge@uscg.mil.

MEMORANDUM FOR 375 CONS/LGCB 					

FROM: 375 OG/CC
859 Buchanan Street/ Rm 427
Scott AFB, IL 62225-5117

SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification Letter for Magenta Inc.

1. 375 OG proposes to purchase flight control surfaces from Magenta Inc. for a C-141B static aircraft scheduled for display in the future Scott AFB airpark.  These services include removal of depleted uranium counterweights, replacement with dummy counterweights, and shipment of completed flight surfaces to Scott AFB.   

2.  We recommend this as a sole source requirement because:

a. This action is urgent and compelling due to the fact that Magenta Inc., who is currently in possession of flight control surfaces previously mounted on 375 AW aircraft, plans to destroy said flight control surfaces within 20 days.  Additionally, Magenta is the only known commercial supplier with available C-141 flight control surfaces.  

b. By contracting with Magenta Inc. to perform the depleted uranium removal and counterweight replacement, we receive a cost savings because Magenta Inc. has flight control surfaces in stock, which eliminates costly shipping charges, plus Magenta Inc. currently has a team of experts on staff who are working similar requirements. 

c. Our market research indicated that the only other possible source for these flight control surfaces would be through Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC); also know as the ?Bone Yard.?  A representative from AMARC was contacted and advised they have never performed the requested operation nor do they have the knowledge, team or supplies to perform these actions.   

3.  There is no potential for future sole source requirements because this is the last known C-141 scheduled for static display that requires flight controls with the depleted uranium removed.  Based on the information above, it is my recommendation that this requirement be sole sourced to Magenta Inc.

 
4.  Please forward any questions you may have to SSgt Michael Herbert at DSN 576-7054.

CURTIS C. CONNELL, Col, USAF

NOTE: The contracting officer, and not the requiring activity, is the final authority for determining the adequacy of any sole source justification before contact placement

<DESC>Contractor Questions and Answers Round 1:

Question 1: I see no reference to the FAR 'Buy American' requirement.  Is this out?

Answer 1: Please consult the FAR references mentioned in the solicitation, which discuss (in FAR Part 25), the origin issue.  The Buy American Act does not apply to this acquisition; instead the Trade Agreements apply.  The FAR may be found on the Internet at:
http://acquisition.gov/far/index.html

Question 2: On all items where Air Conditioning is optional, do you want the unit quoted without A/C as the base, and then have the optional A/C listed as an extra cost?

Answer 2: This is acceptable.  You can show the cost without A/C, and then indicate how much extra it would cost to include A/C.

Question 3: If we are right you need some kind of vehicles and you need that they include taxes that we have here in our country?  Also, you need that we provide you warranties?

Answer 3: Generally, for vehicles imported into Ecuador (as oppose to locally purchased vehicles), the Embassy is not able to obtain either a waiver or reimbursement from the Ecuadorian government for local Value Added Taxes (VAT) and Customs Duties.  Currently, VAT is 12% and the Customs Duty for imported vehicles is 10%.  It is up to each company participating in this procurement to research what taxes and/or duties are applicable for the vehicles proposed by the company, and any applicable taxes or duties must be included in the quotation.

Question 4: In solicitation Section 2.0 (Pricing), it states the following: "The Contractor shall provide the vehicles listed below at firm-fixed price(s).  Provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.  The above price(s) is in terms of "Cost, Insurance and Freight" (CIF), with final delivery to be made in Quito, Ecuador.  The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in Quito.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles."

In addition to the request CIF destination, it is our understanding that we would also need to provide proper insurance coverage in country (Ecuador) until such time as the vehicles or motorcycles are actually physically delivered to NAS in Quito? 

Answer 4: The vehicles and motorcycles must be delivered to customs in Ecuador.  The Embassy will go to customs to clear the vehicles/motorcycles.  Clearing the vehicles/motorcycles at customs will constitute acceptance, and the Embassy will then be responsible for taking the items from customs to their final destination.

Question 5: In solicitation Section 3.0 (Payment), it states the following: "The Contractor may invoice after completion of delivery (partial deliveries allowed)."

Is it possible to respond offering alternative payment terms?  That is, which may be considered as an alternative to proposed payment terms following actual delivery as outlined herein?

Answer 5: Payment will be made only after delivery.  In the case of a partial delivery, you may only invoice for the number of vehicles or motorcycles delivered.

Question 6: In Solicitation Section 6.0 (Evaluation of Quotations), it states that the Government may make one award or multiple awards, whichever is most advantageous to the Government.

With specific regard to motorcycles only, is it our understanding that more than one dealer may be awarded this same bid/contract?

Answer 6: Due to the number of different items required, it is understood that some companies may only be able to quote on one or a limited number of the different line items.  For this reason, multiple awards may be necessary.  However, it is unlikely that any single line item (such as the motorcycles) will be split in to multiple awards, unless multiple awards are necessary to obtain the desired quantity.

Questions 7: The NAICS code for Line Item 0007 is 336991; size standard 500 employees.  Is it correct that this NAICS code relates to supplier businesses which employ <500 employees?

Answer 7: Some NAICS codes are based on company revenue, while others are based on the number of employees.  For the NAICS code you referenced, a company operating under that NAICS code would be considered a small business if the company has 500 or fewer employees.  Keep in mind, though, that this acquisition is not set aside for only small businesses.  This acquisition is unrestricted, which means that both small and large businesses may participate.

Question 8: Regarding the seating capacity for the bus, it says: "25 to 30 passengers capacity (including or not driver)."  Does this mean "not including driver"?

Answer 8: You are correct.  The capacity should be 25 to 30 passengers, not including the driver.

Question 9: As a former General Manager at an automobile dealership I have negotiated fleet purchases and arranged shipping to foreign countries.  This type of negotiation would be similar with the addition of the arrangements for warranty.  That being said, must there also be a dealership for the brands of each vehicle type, and must they have a service department?

Answer 9: One of the requirements in solicitation Section 1.0 is that the vehicle(s) quoted must be capable of being maintained commercially in Ecuador and must be covered by the manufacturer's warranties.  In Section 6.0 (Evaluation of Quotations), there are several items listed under Factor 2 that the quoted vehicle(s) are required to meet, and each quoter must submit appropriate technical documentation and other relevant documentation to show that the quoted vehicle(s) meet these requirements.  Two of the requirements under Factor 2 are that the vehicle is capable of being maintained commercially in Ecuador, and that the vehicle is cost-effective to operate and maintain.  It is up to each quoter to determine how to show that the vehicle(s) quoted meet these requirements.

Question 10: My next question is country of origin for the manufacturers.  I assume you would prefer an American branded product for the automobiles and light trucks.  However, for the larger trucks this may be more difficult.  As for the motorcycles, Harley Davidson is the only American contractor for motor cycles I am aware of and Harleys are considerably more expensive than a comparable Japanese brand.  I suppose the key question would be; is buy American more important than the bottom line price?

Answer 10: Due to the unique requirement for the vehicles and motorcycles, which is to support anti-narcotics missions and surveillance, what is more important is that the vehicles quoted are consistent with those commonly seen on the roads in Ecuador.  This, as well as the points explained in #9 above, will be important factors in determining whether the quoted vehicles will meet the mission needs.  (Also, see question #1 above.)

Question 11: Regarding the Cargo Truck (Item 4.4):

a.  For Tires (4.4.13), what is meant by "Ring 15 to Ring 18"?

b.  For Cargo Area (4.4.14): What body configuration is desired?  Flatbed, with or without removable stake sides/ends, or removable solid sides?  Steel front bulkhead, with or without mesh screen window opening?  Tarp?  Van Body?  Dump Body?  etc?

Answer 11:

a.  Tires: from ring 15 to ring 18.  That?s the size of the tire.  For example, in a truck that has this specification:  7.5-16-14PR or 235/70R16.  This means a ring 16 inches inside diameter tire.

b.  Cargo area and body configuration:

In Ecuador it is called ?chasis cabinado? ? that means chassis and cabin.  They usually sell this kind of body configuration and then we will construct a wagon to be mounted on the chassis.

Question 12: For the Mid-Size Bus (Item 4.5), do you really want (auxiliary) floor mats and locks on all doors (reference 4.5.19)?

Answer 12:

Floor mats are not necessary.

Locks on all doors: driver?s door ? yes, right door ? the mechanism usually locks the door.

<DESC>Contractor Questions and Answers Round 2:

Question 13: Is the requirement for the vehicles to have "zero miles" literally meant as zero.?  I understand this is a solicitation for new automobiles but new cars rarely have zero since miles are incurred during transport.  What is a reasonable mileage range.

Answer 13: It's understood that it's difficult in some cases to avoid putting a few miles on vehicles because of requirements such as moving vehicles to suppliers, getting winches mounted, etc.  A very few miles would not be an issue, provided that it can be clearly shown that the miles are directly related to preparing the vehicles for delivery under the contract.  The main point is that it must be clear that the vehicles are new from the factory, and that they were not used as demonstration vehicles or in any other capacity that is inconsistent with being classified as new vehicles.

Question 14: We intend to acquire all vehicles in Ecuador or a neighboring country.  That being said, is Venezuela excluded as an option?

Answer 14: If the vehicles are a Venezuela end product, then they cannot be accepted since Venezuela is not a designated country under FAR 25.003.

Question 15: In the event that the vehicles are purchased from a location within Ecuador, do you require them to be at a central teaming location, delivered to the Embassy, or will they be picked up at the dealer?

Answer 15: The Embassy would provide the location where the vehicles need to be delivered.

Question 16: Warranty and title transfers will be a consideration in cost.  Each time a vehicle is titled additional cost will be incurred.  I assume whoever is awarded the contracts will be told the name of the shell company in whose name you intend to title the vehicles initially for the purpose of secrecy.  Am I correct in this assessment?

Answer 16: The vehicles will be titled to the Embassy.  The correct title information will be provided to the successful offeror(s) after award.
