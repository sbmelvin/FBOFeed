<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, Rome NY intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source purchase order under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 with Microwave Information (MI) Technologies, 1125 Satellite Blvd., Suite 100, Suwanee, GA 300024 for repair of 120/120.1 Oscillator Assembly, quantity 1; Channel Demodulator Assemblies, quantity 2; and 45 MHz IF Reference Assembly, quantity 1. Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received within twelve (12) days after date of publication of the solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334515.
<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>AFRL/RIGE requires the repair of the equipment listed above. MI Technologies is the only source that can provide the repair labor for the Oscillator Assembly, Channel Demodulator Assemblies, and 45 MHz IF Reference Assembly due to the fact that MI Technologies is the only source that has the knowledge and required reference documentation for the defective units. MI Technologies' proprietary interfaces do not allow direct one for one replacement of components; therefore, without the repair of this defective equipment, the Air Force would have to develop new hardware and software to integrate a second source component.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Air Force Material Command, Electronics Systems Center to determine the viability of pursuing a competitive production acquisition of a Joint Precision Airdrop System aircraft Mission Support Equipment (MSE) capability that supports the U.S. Army guided payload deployment to improve the accuracy of high-altitude cargo delivery.  Air Mobility Command desires that production deliveries of production JPADS begin in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  To assist industry assessment of this initiative, the JPADS overall system performance attributes are set forth below in the JPADS MSE General Requirements section. A sample of the existing JPADS aircraft MSE is not available for reverse engineering or technical assessment at this time; however, if sufficient industry response indicates this is a viable method of establishing an alternate manufacturing source, this may be explored.

<DESC>National Sychrotron Light Source II

Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking an expression of interest  by General Contractors for the construction of conventional facilities for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) project, which is to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY 11973.

The NSLS-II will be an advanced, highly optimized third generation medium energy storage ring with full injection for top-off mode operation.  The X-ray brightness and flux of NSLS-II will be world leading, exceeding that of any other currently existing or under construction.  It will be 10,000 times brighter and have 10 times higher flux than the present NSLS.  NSLS-II will meet the nations need for a high brightness, medium energy X-ray source. It will enable structural studies of the smallest crystals in structural biology, provide a wide range of nanometer resolution probes for Nanoscience, enable coherent beam scattering studies of the dynamics of condensed matter systems, and enable new methods for imaging the structure of disordered materials and biological systems.

The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a Ring Building of approximately 392,000 square feet. 

The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of the NSLS-II and will house the main accelerator ring, offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities. 

The proposed construction type for the Ring building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for the upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior. Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin or membrane roof systems. 

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines, and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces. Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete, with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines. The NSLS-II Ring Building has been designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces. Additionally, the building design minimizes electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) in the experimental beamline areas, certain portions of the accelerator, and laboratory spaces by the routing of electrical cabling and placement and shielding of electrical equipment. There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline and certain laboratory spaces that will require a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

BSA places great importance on worker safety and the maintenance of a safe worksite.  A safety incentive will be included as part of this procurement.  The safety incentive will be based on the following factors; 1) Accident/Injury Rates; 2) Serious violation of OSHA requirements and 3) Responsiveness to less serious OSHA requirements.  

The estimated value of conventional construction ranges between $180,000,000 and $205,000,000.  

The planned procurement method will be a Request for Proposal which will be evaluated based upon past performance and other technical factors.

<DESC><p>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), 380 New York St, Redlands, CA 92373 for purchase of an Academic Software Site License.</p>
<p>The following are primary reasons for this sole source procurement, for which only one responsible source will satisfy the Air Force Academy's requirement:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; The Geospatial Information System section within the 10th Civil Engineer Squadron has been using ESRI software since their initial development eight years ago.&nbsp; All of the new mapping and client specific applications have been developed using the ESRI line of software products.&nbsp; In addition, all current applications under contract are being accomplished using ESRI software.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; The Dean of Faculty's Georgraphy Department also uses the current ESRI Academic Site License for teaching all Geographical Information System coursework to the cadets.&nbsp; In addition, they also develop specific GIS client applications in support of cadet coursework and other GIS users on the Academy.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Software standardization between the 10th Civil Engineer Squadron, DFEG, and the entire USAF Academy is extremely critical.&nbsp; Compatibility of software allows GIS data sharing between all agencies on the Academy, and will continue to support GIS development in the future.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; The Air Force Civil Engineering Automated Strategic Plan states, "Geospatial Information Systems software must be compatible with all DoD Federal and Non-Federal agencies."&nbsp; The software included in this site meets this requirement.</p>
<p>Award of this contract to another company will jeapordize the performance of our mission by making all our existing GIS data non-usable.</p>
<p>Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source. No other type of supply or service will satisfiy agency requirements.&nbsp; Interested persons may identify theri interst and capability to meet this requirement.&nbsp; This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. If no response is received by&nbsp;September 5th, 2008 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and/or services through a sole source procurement with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), a sole source award will be made.</p>

QUOTESAREBEING REQUESTED.  Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT000904 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National EnergyTechnology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA,  intends to purchase thefollowing:1.

Refrigerated Cooling System (RCS40-120V). (1 each).4.  Pressure Regulator. (1 each),5.  RCS gas dryer. (1 each).6.  Kit Ethernet Switch. (1 each).7.  Tzero Press Die. (1 each).8.  Installation. (1 job).DSC specifications:Temperature range:        -180 to 725aC (Total)                                         -40 to 400 C with RCS-40Temperature Accuracy:     0.1XCTemperature Precision:      0.05aCCalorimetric Precision (based on metal standards):  0.1%Maximum Calorimetric Sensitivity:    0.2 WSensitivity/Resolution:       > 30 mW/XCBaseline Curvature (-50X to 300XC):    10 WBaseline Reproducibility:     10 WBaseline Noise (max. peak to peak):     <1WDynamic Range:       +/- 500 mWInstrument Features1.  DSC instrumentation is of the Heat Flux design whereby the sample andreference are measured in the same furnace, on separate stages.1. The DSC should employ area temperature detectors directly beneath thesampleand reference positions, not platinum resistance thermometers orthermopiles.2. The DSC furnace shall be constructed of silver, with platinel heaterwindings.  The benefit of this design is in the uniform thermalenvironment,and long furnace lifetime.3. Purge gas is pre-heated prior to entering the sample chamber and sweepsacross sample for optimal purge interaction with sample.  By design, alloxygenis purged from "dead spaces" of cell; reliance on diffusion of purge gas isavoided.4. DSC must accommodate Modulated DSC, defined and compliant as describedinsection below.5. DSC must come equipped with a robotic autosampler as described below.6. DSC must include touch screen for easy controller access and monitoring.7. DSC must communicate with computer/controller through Ethernet BUS.8. DSC must include dual digital mass flow control.  These mass-flowcontrollers must be incorporated into the instrument (i.e. shall not be aseparate unit).  Flow rate must be programmable within operating software,anddeliverable as a saved signal in the data file.  Mass flow controllers mustalso allow for automated gas switching during an experiment.9. Data files contain measured sample temperature, not calculatedtemperature.This allows the user to know what temperature the sample is actually atduringdifferent heating rate experiments and makes for accurate and precisetransition temperatures.10. Must have up to five points for temperature calibration.Software1.  The DSC must include operating software, which allows for theinstrument tobe fully calibrated and verified automatically, without the need foroperatorpresence (when equipped with an autosampler).  Calibrations must includebaseline, cell constant, and temperature.  Scheduling capabilities must bepresent, such that these calibrations and/or verifications can beprogrammed toperform during normal quiescent periods, such as overnight or on weekends.Thesoftware must also be capable of sending automatic communications as to thestatus of these calibration/verification experiments, either by email orinstant messaging, so that the operator is fully apprised of their status.2.  In addition, the instrument software must be capable of performing aseriesof auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through the schedulingcomponent.These tests should verify the performance of various instrument componentssuchas autosampler/autolid motors, electronic boards, mass flow controllers,etc.The results of these tests should be logged and the option to automaticallyreport the result via email or instant messaging should be included.3.  The operating software should also be capable of periodically andautomatically checking for updates via an Internet connection, anddownloading/installing those updates if desired.4.  The data analysis software should be unkeyed, to allow for unlimitedinstallations within one site.  The data file format should easily allowsharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents, whicharereadable by the same data analysis package.  The data analysis programshouldalso include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.Heat Flow Measurement1.  Instrument must employ advanced techniques for the accurate measurementofheat flow.  These techniques are to include the existence of a temperaturesensor located midway between the sample and reference sensor.  Thisprovidesfor independently measure sample and reference heat flow, and also acts asacontrol sensor for optimal heating rate regulation.Autosampler Performance1.  Instrument must come equipped with a robotic autosampler.2.  Autosampler must be able to load no less than 50 sample pans and nolessthan 5 reference pans in one tray.3.  Autosampler shall accommodate a variety of DSC pan types, including butnotlimited to: standard, hermetic, open, and high-volume.4.  Autosampler must employ auto-lid device, which removes all coveringsfromthe DSC sensor with a mechanism independent of the sample loadingmechanism.5.  Maximum time to unload existing sample and load new sample shall notexceed70 seconds.6.  Autosampler shall employ mechanical finger-style gripper, not a suctiondevice.7.  Autosampler shall incorporate redundant optical and electrical pansensingfor maximum reliability.8.  Autosampler shall include optical sensors for automatic calibration9.  Autosampler shall employ automated position calibration routine thatrequires minimal input from the user.  Full auto-calibration should beperformed in less than 5 minutes.10.  Autosampler shall be controllable through a touch-screen display, orbysome other means independent of the controlling computer.11.  Autosampler shall not require regular lubrication.Modulated DSCModulated DSC must be supplied with the following criteria: Ability to apply sinusoidal temperature wave to sample:  Amplitude ofsinewave  0.01 to 3aC; frequency period from 10 to 200 seconds. Must include the ability to perform quasi-isothermal experiments, i.e.holding isothermal with a small temperature modulation. The temperature modulation should be strictly periodic to ensurecontinuoussteady-state control and exact experiment reproducibility, randomtemperatureperturbations are not acceptable. In order to view the signals real-time, deconvolution of the signals mustbedone real-time, on board the module using a discrete FourierTransformation,not after the scan. All of the signals above must be collected during one single experimentandstored in one single data file. Must be able to view the following signals in real-time during theexperiment: Total Heat Flow, Total Heat Capacity, Reversing Heat Capacity,Reversing Heat Flow, Non-Reversing (Kinetic) Heat Flow, ModulatedTemperature,Modulated Heat Flow, Heat Flow Phase, Reference Sine Angle, TemperatureAmplitude, Heat Flow Amplitude. The heat capacity measurements must not require a prior baseline scanthathas to be subtracted from the sample scan for quantitative data. Must include the ability to measure thermal conductivity of insulatorswithno hardware modifications to DSC.DELIVERY: FOB Destination is required (all freight included).  Theprovisionsat 52.212-2 Evaluation V Commercial Items (JAN 1999) does not apply to thisacquisition.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING OF PROTOTYPE MULTI-SORBENTTUBE AIRSAMPLERThis is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions, assupplemented with additional information included in this notice.   QUOTESAREBEING REQUESTED.  Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT000924 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National EnergyTechnology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA,  intends to purchase thefollowing:1.  Design, development, and testing of a prototype multi-sorbent tube airsampler to be transported by an unmanned aerial vehicle above sequestrationsites to verify the integrity of the storage site. (1 each).  As per thefollowing:Work Statement to Accompany Request for Design and Construction of anAutomatedAir Sampler to be Tranported by an Unmanned Aerial VehicleNETL would like to contract the design, construction, and testing of asampleholder which could support small glass vials of a specific dimension,automatically open the vials sequentially to expose the sorbent inside foraspecific volume of air, close the vials again, and repeat this with anumber ofvials.  This entire sample holder would be mounted to an unmanned aerialvehicle and the exposure of the sample vials could be programmed orcontrolledby wireless communication to an operator on the ground.  The exposedsorbentswould later be analyzed at the NETL lab and resultant data would be used toverify the integrity of CO2 sequestration sites.A prototype of the sample holder, sampling system, and its attachment anduseby an unmanned aerial vehicle would be required to demonstrate to NETLresearchers the reliability of the sample holder.  If approved, fouradditionalsample holders of the same design would be supplied to NETL for use atsequestration sites.Details of Sampler DesignThe glass vials containing the sorbent are approximately  in diameter, 2long, and have a mass of 2  grams.  On command the sorbent inside would beexposed, air would be pumped through the sorbent by an air pump at acontrolledrate.  A rotational device could be used or a valving system could be usedtosequentially open and close each glass vial within the sampler.  Thesamplerwill be attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle which will fly over thesurfacetest area, which may be one square mile or more.  Control of the samplingsystem must be available wirelessly to an operator on the ground.Specific Requirements of the SamplerIn order to be a practical research tool and provide useful information thesampler must:i. hold at least 10 glass vials with sorbentii. provide air flow through the vials at a rate between 5 and 3000 cc/miniii. be light weight in order to be part of the payload of an unmannedaerialvehicleiv. be powered by a rechargeable batteryv. provide a stable flow of air through the sorbent despite changes in airpressurevi. have a built in telemetry system that can transmit to the groundstationthe data in real timevii. have a built in telemetry system with at least a one mile line ofsightrangeviii. provide the ability to turn the air pump on and off during flightix. provide the ability to control which sorbent vial is being exposedx. provide pump flow information to the user during flightxi. record all exposure data as well as position data for analysis aftertheflightsxii. be rugged enough to survive rough landings of the unmanned aerialvehiclewhich is transporting itTesting and Approval ProcessThe sample holder, as detailed above, must be rigorously tested at a fieldsitebefore approval by NETL researchers.  The sample holder will be attached toanunmanned aerial vehicle, take off from the ground, and proceed through acontrolled flight, demonstrating the utility and ruggedness of the sampleholder.  After testing and approval, as part of this contract, fouradditionalsample holders of the same design will be provided to NETL for futureresearch.Contact informationIn order to obtain the glass vials or if there are further questions,contact:J.

<DESC>SUBJECT:  GAS SORPTION ANALYZERThis is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions, assupplemented with additional information included in this notice.   QUOTESAREBEING REQUESTED.  Responses shall reference Request for Quotations No.DE-RQ26-08NT000923 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National EnergyTechnology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA, intends to purchase a GASSORPTION ANALYZER:1.  Fully automated, two sample port, gas sorption analyzer (performsmeasurements of adsorption & desorption of many gases for characterizationofsurface area & pore size distribution of powdered and other porous solids);complete with standard parts & accessories. (1 each).2.  Win Data reduction Software.  (1 each).3.  Vacuum Pump.  (2 each).4.  FloVac Degasser; six sample port, flow and vacuum sample preparationunitfor added degassing throughput.  (1 each).The following specifications are required for the GAS SORPTION ANALYZER:NETL Researches require an analyzer that is capable of doing both of thefollowing analyses: B.E.T. surface area and pore volume. The research hasbeenexpanded to include investigation of other innovative materials for gasseparation looking at optimum materials for various processes separation.NETLresearchers need to be able to evaluate these materials accurately,quickly,and efficiently in determining the best possible one(s).To be able to do this would require the following instrumentspecifications: A self-contained bench scale instrument that does high quality dualsampleanalyses of both surface areas and pores on powdered and porous materialsin ashort time frame (~8 min or less) Two stations which are necessary to be run on simultaneous samples witheither of the following combinations:o B.E.T. & B.E.T,o  B.E.T. & pore size,o  pore size & pore size,o or pore size and continuous saturation vapor pressure. multiple techniques are required for measurement of the saturation vaporpressure.o  a wide surface area range from 0.01 square meters/gram to no upperlimit;o a pore size range :  ~ 3.5 to > 4000   (0.35 nm to > 4000nm), An all in one small (~ 2 square feet) unit which has self-containedenclosures since lab hoods may not be available and counter space is alsolimited, with built in sample preparation stations capable of flow andvacuumout gassing. The use of a no void analysis which does not require the use of heliumgas.(NOTE: current concerns regarding the shortage of helium gas, research hasbeeninstructed if possible not to use helium) The use of only one gas to operate the instrument, but also need theoptionto select from a variety of gases which includes non-corrosive gases (i.e.carbon dioxide, nitrogen, butane, etc.) to examine a variety of differentsamples. Versatility to prepare samples either under vacuum or flow conditions. There will be times when continuing testing (greater than 24 hrs) duringthework week will be necessary without interrupting the operation. This isaccomplished with liquid nitrogen (available here on site) in a dewar.Therefore, a dewar elevator will be necessary to bring the dewar up as itevaporates while maintaining the sample in liquid nitrogen. The ability to operate the unit connected to a PC or by itself. A degasser which can do two separate sample preparation techniques on atleast 6 samples. It is necessary to be able to degass six samples, eitherindividually or all together while each sample can be removed as needed andanother can be placed to be prepared, while running analysis.o The degassing range: ambient to 400C, in1C increments (with less than5Cfluctuation). (It is important to examine various ranges of material exposure and to doasmany as possible in looking for the optimum material). An all in one unit outgassing station that can allowo  for adjustable evacuation rates,o various fittings to accommodate various glassware(i.e. 3 various diameterstems),o needle valves to prevent the blowing out of fine powders,o metal flow tubes to allow for variable depth into the cell,o flow rate for each station,o each port should have the ability to be adjusted individually up to 100cc/min. Filter gaskets to prevent vacuum system contamination by powderedsamples. The ability to access the degasser during an analysis to either start orstopthe flow or the vacuum degassing without interrupting analysis. touch control panel attached to the unit built-in microprocessoro required for guided calibration for optimum performance meeting ISOrequirements.   high-sensitivity pressure transducer that has high stabilityo preferred accuracy +/-0.11% with a minimum resolvable pressure 0.016 mmHg,and a minimum resolvable pressure P/Po (N2) of 0.00002). The apparatus must be capable of using multiple techniques which includeCO2DFT/Monte Carlo Models (also used here for research), TempComp algorithm(corrects for evaporation of liquid nitrogen), NLDFT models (for combinedmicropore and mesopore distribution); many of these are already used incurrentexperimental studies.o Adsorption and desorption isotherms (linear and logarithmic scales)o Langmuir surface area (includes slope, intercept, constant, andcorrelationco-efficient)o Plot of single-point B.E.T. surface area also as function of pressureo Fractal dimension by NK and FHH methods.o Micropore volume and surface area by t-plot method:(using Halsey, deBoer,or carbon STSA equations); other various methods include the following formesopore size distribution by BJH or DH method and micropore sizedistributionby MP method. Consistent solenoid valves. The ability to check on or calibrate manifold volume.o Leak-free (10-9 cc/sec) dosing manifold. RTD coolant sensor for constant void volume required for high accuracy ascoolant evaporates. The instrument needs to meet the following ISO Standards: 15901-2 whichaddresses the acceptable instruments and techniques and 15901-3 whichdescribesthe acceptable data reduction for pore size analysis via gas sorption.(Notethat the NOVA is in complete compliance with section 9 which describes theStatic Volumetric method.) The software for the instrument should allow for secure operation of theinstrument, data acquisition, and report generation. Note that this meetstheregulatory requirements for electronic records set forth by the FDA andeventhough they are set by the FDA, with current research expansion includingUniversity students, etc, safe electronic records would be a good idea. DELIVERY: FOB Destination is required (all freight included).

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Mossbauer Spectrometer MIMOS II instrument. Thepurpose of the Mossbauer Spectrometer is to meet a Mission objective set forth by theNASA Mars Exploration Program Office to search for and characterize a wide range of rocksand soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the MIMOS II instrument from Space and Earth ScienceInstrumentation (SPESI). The SPESI MIMOS II instrument operation is different fromstandard laboratory instruments because of the small size and the backscatter measurementgeometry, which were required by the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Mission Team.  Thesmall size is a requirement to use in Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science(ARES) Mars-environment simulation chambers in order to produce exact and equivalentmeasurements to that of the MARS Mission.  The backscatter geometry is required so thatrock surfaces (with and without coatings) can be analyzed analogous to operations on theMartian surface. For these reasons, it is essential to operate an electronicallyequivalent instrument in the ARES Spectroscopy Laboratory for full interpretation of datafrom the MER mission.  Only Space and Earth Science Instrumentation (SPESI) makes thisinstrument and an exact replication of the flight instruments is critical to meetingMission objectives set forth by the Mars Exploration Program Office.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon September 9, 2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

The Institute intends to procure this system under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302.  GE Healthcare BioSciences is the sole authorized distributor of the AKTA Purifier UPC System
This system will be used to purify biomolecules from complex starting materials.  The contractor shall provide a system:1)	able to perform separations based on a variety of sample characteristics, such as molecular weights, net surface charge, hydrophobicity, while retaining biological activity. 2)	With a flow rate range of .01-100 mls/min at pressures ranging from 0-10 MPa (1450psi)3)	With a two-pump gradient system, with dynamic mixing.4)	The wetted flow path inert to halides.  The pump heads must be titanium with valves and tubing in PEEK.5)	Pumps should allow operation of the system at zero backpressure to ensure system compatibility with standard low-pressure chromatography supports often used in affinity chromatography and other techniques.6)	The controller must allow programs to be time-based, volume-based, or column-volume based.7)	Should include the option of  a fraction collector that is fully integrated into the system and fully controllable via the system control software.  This fraction collector must have the capacity to fractionate into 175x 12-mm diameter tubes or 95x 10-18mm tubes.8)	Should include a motorized valve for sample injection.  The system must have the ability to control 8 more motorized valves for a total 9 motorized valves.  The motorized valves should provide feedback to the control system to ensure proper orientation of all valves.  The valves should be driven electronically and require no external air or pressure to operate.9)	The system controller must allow the user to be entering details of the next purification at the same time the current separation is being done, or to simultaneously be integrating and evaluating the results of earlier runs.  The software must allow complete manual control of all parameters and running conditions while running a method.10)	Control of motorized valves, fraction collector, dynamic gradient mixer, and autosampler must all be possible from the system controller.11)	The controller must accept seven input signals (e.g. UV wavelength, conductivity, pH, temperature, pressure).  It must be capable of plotting, and integrating these signals, as well as using them to trigger sub-routines in the programming when the signal exceeds a present threshold, to allow the automation of multi-dimensional separations.12)	The system must include one automatic three-position injection valve (load, inject, and wash positions), which will allow for sample loading onto the column.13)	The system controller should allow for automation of the optimization of separation parameters (e.g. sample volume, flow rate, gradient slope).  This should allow a small amount of sample to be consumed in optimizing the purification scheme, after which the best regime can be scaled up on the same LC system.14)	Column equilibration before and after sample injection and elution must be capable of being monitored, with a feed-back loop to the control system, so we can be certain equilibration is completed, without consuming, excess volume of sometimes expensive buffers.15)	Documentation of each run should be automatic and exhaustive, so that for purposes of subsequent replication and eventual publication, no detail is left unrecorded.  Access to the controller must be by user name with password and level of access by each user must be definable administrator.  Post-run chromatographic analysis and reporting functions should also be included.16)	The system must have a definable pressure limit system defined when the column is selected from a list which will stop the pump and generate an audible and visual warning, in the event pressure exceeds the preset limit.  The controller should allow the user the option of including in his/her chromatographic methods programs, commands which will automatically reduce the flow rate if an over-pressurization occurs as sample is being applied or eluted from the column.  Additional variables which should also be programmable to trigger sub-routines (e.g. new tube on fraction collector; valve changes; etc.) should include UV or conductivity signals.  The controller must turn off the pump flow when a signal is received from the fraction collector indicating there are no tubes remaining, so that valuable sample is preserved.17)	The system must automatically and continuously be able to record throughout each chromatographic run the following parameters; flow rate; UV signal; actual AND programmed conductivity of the eluent; eluent pH; system pressure; accumulated time of run; all valve positions and changes in position; activity of a fraction collector- and it must allow these recorded data to be called up later for interpretation and to aid in future replication of results.  It must allow for post-run analysis of chromatograms, export of data to other spreadsheet programs, and generation of written reports.18)	Set-up and training must be provided by the vendor. This is not a solicitation for competitive proposals.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient details to allow NIDDK to determine if the party can meet all of the foregoing requirements.  Offers must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties and/or other information that demonstrates that the offer meets all of the foregoing requirements.  An original and one copy of the capability statements and related materials must be received in this office by 3:00p.m. EST on or before September 9, 2008.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Request for copies of the Request for Quotation (RFQ) shall be emailed to Nydia Sagna @ sagnan@mail.nih.gov or faxed to 301-480-4226.

<DESC>This amendment provides responses to questions from industry and extends the solicitation closing date:
Q:  What is the projected site density for this survey area? 	A:	It is estimated to be 1 site per 75 to 100 acres.  However, sites are not evenly distributed.  In general, the primary types of sites are historic features near water sources and along historic roads and trails; and lithic scatters in open meadows.  Most of the project area has dense spruce-fir and mixed conifer forest that makes ground visibility poor. Q:  What were the results of the previously conducted 3,000 acre survey in the Roost Burn Area? 	A:  See above response.  The previous survey was not all done in one project, but piecemeal over a number of fires and other projects.  Consequently, we don't have a single report that summarized the results.  Q:  Is there a page limit for this RFQ? 
A:  We did not establish a page limit for this RFQ.
Q:  Do Davis Bacon Wage Rates apply for this survey and if so what are they?
A:  No.  Davis Bacon Wage Rates do not apply to this federally-funded project.  Service Contract Act (SCA) wages apply to this procurement: (SCA 2005-2023 Rev 9 dated May 29, 2008, Coconino County, Arizona), as set forth in the solicitation.
Q:  Is it possible to set up a project camp area and bring in port-o-johns and/or are campgrounds with facilities available? 	A:  Yes, the contractor could request a group site in the North Rim campground or in the USFS campground (DeMotte Park) just outside the park (subject to availability).  It might also be possible for them to camp at the administrative camping area on Lindbergh Hill.  This area is along the Entrance Road and is used for Fire Camps and previous contractors have stayed there.  The site would not be available in the event that a Fire Camp was using it and the NPS is not able to predict this.   The contractor would need to provide port-o-potties, pack out trash, etc as there are no facilities at this location.
Q:  Is there a funding cap not to exceed on this project that we should be aware of.
A:  No.  We do not disclose the project magnitude for this work.
As a result of this amendment, the solicitation closing date changes to September 2, 2008 at 3 PM (M.S.T.)  All other terms remain unchanged.  
Email all quote documents no later than solicitation closing date and time to elizabeth_baierl@nps.gov.     Ensure you include a total price for the entire project (CLIN 0001); adequate technical information (references, resumes, narratives, supporting documentation, licenses, etc.) in order for the technical evaluators to ascertain the level of past performance and experience as set forth in the EVALUATION CRITERIA in the solicitation.  Offerors are reminded to include DUNS number and T.I.N. to verify registration in CCR database and small business size status and to acknowledge this amendment and amendment 0001.END OF AMENDMENT 0002

Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendation to select the best alternative for a full service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the AN-ALQ-144 Countermeasures Sets.  A future solicitation-contract may provide PBL driven support and management services for the AN-ALQ-144 systems, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI..<BR>BACKGROUND: The AN-ALQ-144 (V) Infrared (IR) Countermeasures Set is considered critical mission-essential equipment used aboard the Black Hawk, Apache, Kiowa Warrior, and other aircraft platforms.  It is designed to provide countermeasures to various IR heat-seeking missiles.  The AN-ALQ-144 (V) has various configurations such as AN-ALQ-144 (V), AN-ALQ-144A (V), and AN-ALQ-144C (V).  Each configuration has 4 variables such as AN-ALQ-144 (V) 1-3-5-6, AN-ALQ-144A (V) 1-3-5-6, and AN-ALQ-144C (V) 1-3-5-6.  The AN-ALQ-144 (V) is phasing out from the Army Inventory.  The AN-ALQ-144A (V) will remain in the Army Inventory for a while to meet the FMS and PM-272 Navy requirements.  The AN-ALQ-144C (V) is the most updated version and is deployed in both Army and Navy Helicopters, the AN-ALQ-144C (V) 1-3 is installed in Army helicopters, and the AN-ALQ-144C (V) 5-6 is installed in Navy helicopters.  For purposes of this evaluation, the AN-ALQ-144C (V) 5-6 is excluded from this RFI.  IR Countermeasures Sets consist of one Transmitter, one Operational Control Unit, four Ground Straps, and four Shock Mounts.  The Transmitters consist of an IR source, high and low speed modulators, Covert Window Assembly, and housing.  The Transmitters generates IR energy, modulate it, and then pass it through the Covert Window Assemblies in the form of invisible IR energy.  This modulated IR energy is used to confuse IR heat-seeking missiles, thereby, protecting helicopters and crews from missile attacks.  The Transmitters are equipped with four fault indicators-sensors that shut down operation should improper High and Low Frequency Modulator speeds; IR Source emissions; and-or high temperature conditions exist, however these indicators-sensors are electrical and mechanical in nature and have no software associated with them.  The AN-ALQ-144 is currently supported organically by a 3 level maintenance concept that includes Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM), Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM), and Depot Maintenance.  The AN-ALQ-144 is also logistically supported by the current Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS).  Currently, 40 spare parts, excluding Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) items, are required to support these systems (NSNs and part numbers will be provided upon request).  TM-11-5865-200-12 is available for Unit Maintenance. TM 11-5865-200-34-1 is available for Intermediate Unit Maintenance.  DMWR 11-5865-200-1 is available for Depot Maintenance Work Requirements.  This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to decrease AN-ALQ-144 sustainment costs; improve AN-ALQ-144 sustainment efficiency; and increase sustainment readiness for AN-ALQ-144 customers; without changing the current in-place maintenance structure.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office is searching for the best PBL alternative to support the AN-ALQ-144 without interrupting the current in place logistic supply system.  This office will utilize a full service PBL contract to enhance support of the AN-ALQ-144 based on the recommended PBL alternative.  The overarching objective is to reduce cost without degrading current systems readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <BR>The government contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in the award of a five-year Firm Fixed Price contract with two one- year options. Estimated award date is 27 April 2010.  This office will seek a single support integrator due to the complexity of the required technical support to the customer.  Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for support integration is identified.  If the proposed PBL initiative utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  While this RFI does not include DLA managed items, the family of the AN-ALQ-144 Countermeasures Sets uses DLA managed items.  Some of the DLA managed items are unique to the AN-ALQ-144 and any plan that proposes to use commercial sources for these items must include a plan to draw down existing inventories of these DLA managed items until they are exhausted.  The proposed PBL initiative may consider the use of FAR Part 51 for the use of DLA as a source of supply, but is not required.<BR>RESPONSES: Responses will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry Day.  The second step will be participation in a question and answer session at the Industry Day, whose date and place will be released to interested vendors.  The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 30 calendar days after Industry Day.  Responses shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages.   Submission shall be capable of being printed on 8.5 x 11 inch paper with one inch margin (top, bottom, left and right) and a 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font. Line spacing shall be set at no less than single space.  Tables, drawings and header-footer information shall be 10 point Arial font or larger.  For tables, drawings, landscape orientation is permitted.  Microsoft Office Professional 2000 and PowerPoint 2000 or later shall be used to create the files.  All graphics shall be compatible with MS PowerPoint 2000.  If any of the material provided contains proprietary information, please mark and identify disposition instructions (submitted data will not be returned).  Responses should include, but is not limited to the following:<BR>(A)	Company History: A one page history to include previous major products and primary customer base.  Additionally, RFI responders should provide examples of past experience that would warrant the Governments consideration of the company as a prospective contractor for maintenance, supply support, engineering, training, field support, and other services including handling of the classified information up to SECRET.<BR>(B)	Metrics: Suggest methods to create and maintain a metrics database, for monitoring the performance of the contract.  Also discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive based contract award. <BR>(C)	Additional Information: Knowledge of the IR Countermeasures systems that would demonstrate a technical-logistics capability to support the AN-ALQ-144 in the field if necessary.  Knowledge of the hardware and software changes necessary to update the threat table for current and future changes.  Ability to perform Radiometric testing for performance verification test.<BR>(D)	Surge Requirements: PBL support strategies under peacetime, contingencies, and war scenarios to include ramp-up and draw-down in response to surge requirements and the cessation of contingencies or war scenarios.<BR>(E)	Cost: Vendor should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of its recommended PBL alternative. <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: Written interest in this RFI and written questions to be answered at the Industry Day shall be submitted 20 calendar days after the RFI release date.  Responses to this RFI shall be submitted no later than 30 calendar days after the Industry Day.  All interest, questions, and responses to this RFI shall be submitted in hard copy to US Army CECOM LCMC, CCS-Avionics Directorate, Attention: AMSEL-LC-CCS-A-AS (Hae C.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) requires the services of a professional historic preservation firm to assist with several different historic preservation and NHPA Section 106 compliance tasks at various locations throughout the country.  The National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), oversees 125 national cemeteries and 33 soldiers' lots, of which the majority are technically historic and listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). It is NCA's policy to categorize its monuments as "historic," regardless of their age, and it is NCA's policy to accept appropriate, new donated monuments. NCA's monuments are found throughout the United States, but the oldest and most significant are located predominantly east of the Mississippi River. Thematically these are generally associated with the Civil War or multiple U.S. conflicts. In 2006, NCA completed an initial, comprehensive survey of its monuments/memorials in partnership with the Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) program of Heritage Preservation Inc.; this data is updated annually to assure that new monuments are documented.  The oldest and most significant monuments will be identified by the History Program, NCA. NCA will prioritize and locate the monuments within manageable working "clusters" (such as a 50-mile radius) in cooperation with the contractor, to initiate the project. The contractor shall assure that a range of conservators with expertise in assessment and treatment of outdoor sculpture, located throughout the country, are available for site visits and preparation of assessment documentation.

<DESC><p>This request is an announcement for information for planning purposes only. This sources sought does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Request for Quote, or Invitation for Bid. Nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government's acquisition approach.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) is seeking interested sources for Phase 4 (P4) of the US National Data Center (US NDC) program. The US NDC is the geophysical data acquisition, data processing, reporting and archiving component of the United States Atomic Energy Detection System (USAEDS) operated by the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC). AFTAC's mission is to monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties to standards set by US verification and policy leaders. This mission requires the US NDC to detect, locate and identify foreign nuclear tests and provide rapid reporting and technical assessment to the appropriate national security agencies and policy makers. The US NDC processes and integrates data and information up to and including the Department of Defense (DoD) SECRET level. The US NDC also serves as the data distribution center for all US government and authorized users for International Monitoring System (IMS) data. The focus of this phase is to add increased functionality to the current baseline, fine-tune current systems by increasing performance level, upgrade existing hardware, and sustain the present operational systems.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC is an advanced geophysical data acquisition and processing system which provides the capability to receive, process, archive and report events of interest in monitoring nuclear treaty requirements. It acquires waveform data from a global network of seismic, hydroacoustic and infrasonic stations. Data is stored, distributed to researchers both internal and external to AFTAC, and reliably forwarded to a classified processing system. The US NDC receives data from the International Data Center (IDC) originating from International Monitoring System (IMS) sensors on U.S. territory and from other countries. Users interactively review, refine, correct, and display currently available results.</p>
<p><br />The US NDC consists of the following components: (a) A 24x7 operations center located in the AFTAC Operations Center (AOC), Patrick AFB, FL (PAFB); (b) A 24x7 alternate (ALT) hot-backup system located at Goodfellow AFB, TX (GAFB); (c) A Training System located at the 312th Training Squadron GAFB; (d) A Remote Operations Center (ROC) located at PAFB (used to support unplanned and/or short term AOC outages, fire drills, etc.); (e) The US NDC Sustainment System (SUS, aka the test-bed) and (f) the US NDC Development System (DEVL), both located at AFTAC/PAFB.</p>
<p><br />Current System Parameters include the following:</p>
<p><br />1) Hardware: SUN SPARC-based servers and workstations, Storage area network drives, LTO3 tape archives<br />2) Software: Solaris 8 &amp; 10, Oracle 10g<br />3) Code: C, C++, FORTRAN, PERL, Scheme, SQL, Lisp, ASM, CSH, Java, Makefile, SH, TCL, YACC</p>
<p><br />The operational US NDC hardware (OPS, Alt, Training System, and Remote Operations Center) along with most of the development/sustainment hardware is and will continue to be maintained through a separate AFTAC maintenance support contract.</p>
<p><br />Contractor responsibility will include the development and integration of a total system including ongoing upgrades, advanced geophysical studies and tuning/optimization of software algorithms. All personnel must have a Secret clearance and all key personnel must have a Top Secret (SCI) clearance. A majority of the work will be done within the AFTAC building at Patrick AFB, FL. Therefore, the contractor must have or establish a facility in Florida and have key personnel available to work within AFTAC.</p>
<p>Examples of new and ongoing US NDC development and sustainment items include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p><br />1) One of the primary objectives of the Phase 4 effort is to provide a software and hardware architecture with implementation which will provide the platform for future system growth and enhancements. The functionality shall maintain and enhance existing data acquisition, detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation, event classification, event reporting, data distribution, and data archiving capabilities to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs as specified in the US NDC System Requirements Document (SRD).</p>
<p><br />2) A second major objective of the P4 effort is to make use of modern, object-oriented (OO) software design and development practices to re-architect the US NDC's legacy source code/software baseline that has evolved over the past 15+ years. The most immediate need/target is the interactive analysis tool suite.</p>
<p><br />3) Integration of 3rd party efforts: The Department of Energy (DoE) and Air Force labs, as well as various government contractors are involved in numerous areas of US NDC development. Some examples are: portions of the knowledge base, event classification methodology, and Geographical Information System (GIS). It will be the prime contractor's responsibility to team with these AFTAC partners and integrate their products.</p>
<p><br />4) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing Total System Integration Responsibility (TSIR) for the US NDC. The US NDC contractor is responsible for integration of hardware, COTS/GOTS software and calibration information, and contractor developed software into the US NDC system.</p>
<p><br />5) The US NDC contractor is responsible for providing 24x7 on call support to insure 99% operational availability rate.</p>
<p><br />6) The US NDC contractor participates as a key member of the US NDC Change Management Board (CMB) to insure the US NDC will continue to meet the operational availability requirements. The CMB oversees the US NDC Change Request (CR) process and prioritizes O&amp;M work which includes but is not limited to software bug fixes and minor enhancements, adding new stations to data acquisition and both station and network processing.</p>
<p><br />7) Studies<br />a) Conduct scientific studies to help improve detection, association, location, magnitude/yield estimation and event classification to meet current and future treaty monitoring needs.<br />b) Conduct engineering and IT infrastructure studies (e.g., hardware, software, databases) to help improve overall system performance and help reduce maintenance costs and man power needs.<br />All applicable upgrades to the US NDC shall also be made to the training system, and to the Alt US NDC, both of which are located at Goodfellow AFB TX.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates a diversified fleet of aircraft to detect, deter and mitigate threats to our homeland such as terrorists, acts of terrorism, drug smuggling and other unlawful movement of people and goods across the U.S. borders.  Currently, various aircraft are utilized to perform the airborne interceptor/tracker, maritime/ground surveillance and air/ground interdiction missions.  To improve mission effectiveness and resource flexibility, CBP wishes to explore the feasibility and practicality of using a sensor-equipped multi-role enforcement aircraft (MEA) that can effectively perform these types of missions.

CBP is seeking information on commercially available aircraft that could be configured to satisfy all or a large portion of the general requirements stated below.  The configuration should emphasize the maritime/ground surveillance missions; however, design flexibility is needed to support ancillary missions such as airborne tracker, logistical support and signal intelligence collection.

<DESC>NASA Office of the CIO Request for Information: Agency Consolidated End-userServices (ACES) Contract The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is issuing this Request forInformation (RFI) for meeting its upcoming Information Technology (IT) requirements.These requirements encompass the scope of work supporting all ten NASA field Centers,NASA Headquarters, as well as seven remotely managed locations. NASA spends approximately $1.6 billion dollars annually on IT. A significant portion ofthat amount is used for end-user services. There are major challenges in IT managementassociated with a decentralized IT organization, such as lack of sufficient visibilityinto IT spending, inability to achieve economies of scale, immature IT governance, andinformation security challenges. To meet these challenges, the NASA Office of the ChiefInformation Officer (CIO) is embarking on an effort to consolidate the management ofend-user services, devices, and products, as well as other IT services (see listingbelow). This consolidation will better align IT management with NASAs mission and visionas well as enhance IT security management. NASA anticipates awarding an Agency-wide contract for end-user services in FY 2009.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Quotation<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region [Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1], a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia.  Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Hot and Cold Therapy Disposable.     <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR> The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), and Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA).,   <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years total).  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for the Hot and Cold Therapy Disposable product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Hot and Cold Therapy Disposable product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact:  (Tracy.Martin-Tilghman@amedd.army.mil) (202-782-3663).    <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Northeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Hot and Cold Therapy Disposable, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this Region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $58,903.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown below:<BR><BR>MFG PN	DESCRIPTION<BR>11450-040	AMER INSTANT WARM PAK MEDIUM<BR>69901		MEDC PACK WARM INSTANT 6X9	<BR>69904		MEDC PACK COLD INSTANT LARGE 6X9<BR>6627		COLD PACK 6X10<BR>59688		PACK INSTANT COLD LARGE 6.25 X 8.5 IN<BR>11440-012	AMER INST COLD PAK LGE 9X7<BR>010104	COLD PACK INSTANT, 6 X 9, STANDARD SIZE 24/CS MADE IN USA<BR>6001-047	PACK WARM COMFORT 7X10 W/SOFT COVER<BR>4299.1		5  X 8 INSTANT COLD COMPRESS<BR>11440-900	KOLD PAK, INSTANT ICE PACK<BR><BR>At the request of the Northeast Regional MTFs, vendors may be required to provide on-site support during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POCLarry.Shaughnesy@amedd.army.mil (202-782-3666).  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on September 17, 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>This process will include the above vendor requirement to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria/product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region that its initial submission, and subsequent price quotes and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR><BR><BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/ quotes without discussions.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor initial responses should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by submitting their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria and required electronic product literature as required to the above Northeast Region POC by the required due date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed by the Northeast Region POC.  .  <BR><BR>  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative.      <BR>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Disposable Single-Use Instant Hot/Cold Packs products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes latex-free single-use disposable Instant Hot and Instant Cold Packs in a variety of sizes (small, medium. large).   <BR>	b. Vendor must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and types.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.     <BR>2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) for the Instant Hot/Cold Packs product line, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Instant Hot/Cold Packs product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.   <BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Prime Vendor for the Northeast Region is Owens & Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.  Provide documentation (four-digit code) of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for the Northeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR>6.  Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Instant Hot/Cold Packs product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant, i.e. positive resolutions, etc., in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  <BR>7.  Vendors must supply Instant Hot/Cold Packs products that are latex safe/free.  Vendor must provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc,) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>8.  Vendors must include product Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>9.  Vendor must provide a sample of typical individual item packaging information which includes latex-free status, instructions for use, product lot number, expiration date (as appropriate), and precautionary use/safety information (as appropriate) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>10.  Vendor must specify the expected temperature/temperature range of both the Hot Pack and Cold Pack in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation.  Vendors will be given 7 calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the designated TRBO Clinical Analyst.  Requested product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 7th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting product sample sets.  Sample sets must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 7th calendar day.  Those vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the sample sets required by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 7th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Extremely Poor; Two (2)Below Average; Three (3)Average; Four (4)Above Average; and Five (5)Excellent.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Total Averaged Score Clinical Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.        <BR>1.	(Efficiency of patient care) Hot/Cold Packs activate easily and begin warming/cooling within 30 seconds after activation.    <BR>a.	Clinicians require ease of activation and quick warming/cooling to begin therapy as soon as possible to patient.   <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator follows package directions for activation and observes for ease of activation and feels Packs for onset of warming/cooling effect within 30 seconds as timed on evaluators watch.        <BR>2.	(Efficiency of patient care) Hot/Cold Packs provide consistent temperature treatment over all surfaces of the Pack.  .   <BR>a.	Clinicians require consistency of temperature effect for efficient therapeutic<BR>effect.  <BR>     b.   This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>            Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>  c.    After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator feels all surfaces of Packs and assesses for hot/cold spots and/or areas of inconsistent temperature effect.       <BR>3.	  (Efficiency of patient care and patient/staff safety) Hot/Cold Packs do not leak under<BR>            pressure.  <BR>  a.	Clinicians require leak-proof Packs for effective treatment and to minimize patient injury.  <BR>     b.    This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>            Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>  c.	After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator applies moderate pressure to Packs between palms of hands and observes for leakage of contents.  <BR>4.	  (Efficiency of patient care and risk management) Instructions for Use/Safety<BR>          Precautions on Hot/Cold Packs packaging remain intact/legible during use.  <BR>a.	Clinicians require instructions for Use/Safety Precautions to be legible at all times<BR>during product use.  <BR>     b.    This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>            Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>    c.	After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator attempts to smear package<BR>           instructions using dry fingers and using wet fingers and observes for legibility of<BR>           instructions.  <BR>5.	  (Efficiency of patient care) Hot/Cold Packs remain warming/cooling effect for a<BR>           minimum of 30 minutes.    <BR>a.	Clinicians require warming/cooling effect for 30 minutes or more for efficient patient care.    <BR>b.	The criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>            Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c.	After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator will assess for continued<BR> warming/cooling effect after 30 minutes as timed by the evaluators watch.  <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis.  <BR>(1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  <BR>(2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.<BR>(3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>All vendors that meet the technical/company criteria as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  Vendors who  do not meet the technical/company criteria  will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative and not be contacted to submit pricing.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by COB 4:00PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.    <BR>END<BR>     <BR><BR>

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region that its initial submission, and subsequent price quotes and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  <BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Northeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/ quotes without discussions.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor initial responses should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes when requested should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by submitting their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria and required electronic product literature as required to the above Northeast Region POC by the required due date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed by the Northeast Region POC.    <BR><BR>  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:      <BR><BR>1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Disposable Single-Use Instant Perineal Cold Packs products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes latex-free single-use, individually-wrapped, disposable Instant Perineal Cold Packs (light and moderate/heavy absorbency levels).  Products must be anatomically (or similarly) shaped, have an adhesive strip (or similar means of adhesion), and have a soft, absorbent, unscented, neutral/white cover/attached pad designed for direct contact with non-intact perineal mucous membranes.       <BR>	b. Vendor must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and types.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.     <BR>2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) for the Instant Perineal Cold Packs product line, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Instant Perineal Cold Packs product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.   <BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Prime Vendor for the Northeast Region is Owens & Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified in Phase I.  Provide documentation (four-digit code) of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase III will be disqualified.<BR>5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for the Northeast Region Medical Treatment Facilities to provide sufficient product implementation services and customer servicing to the multi-service regional facilities.  Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. <BR>6.  Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Instant Perineal Cold Packs product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant, i.e. positive resolutions, etc., in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  <BR>7.  Vendors must supply Instant Perineal Cold Packs products that are latex safe/free.  Vendor must provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc,) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>8.  Vendors must include product Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>9.  Vendor must provide a sample of typical individual item packaging information which includes latex-free status, instructions for use, product lot number, expiration date (as appropriate), and precautionary use/safety information (as appropriate) in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR>10.  Vendor must specify the expected approximate temperature/temperature range of the Instant Perineal Cold Pack in response to this RFRIAQ.  <BR><BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR>Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting product sample set in which to deliver the no-cost sample set to the designated TRBO Clinical Analyst.  Requested product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 14th  calendar day after the date of the notice requesting product sample set.  Sample set must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the sample set required by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the product samples will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for product sample set.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR><BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample set against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Extremely Poor; Two (2)Below Average; Three (3)Average; Four (4)Above Average; and Five (5)Excellent.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Total Averaged Score Clinical Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a non-clinical (non-patient care) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score:<BR><BR>1.	  (Efficiency of patient care) Perineal Cold Pack activates easily and begins cooling within 30 seconds after activation.    <BR>a.	Clinicians require ease of activation and quick cooling to begin therapy as soon as possible to patient.   <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial using a Perineal Cold Pack in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator follows package directions for activation and observes for ease of activation and feels Pack for onset of cooling effect within 30 seconds as timed on evaluators watch.        <BR>2.	(Efficiency of patient care) Perineal Cold Pack provides consistent temperature treatment over all surfaces of the Pack.     <BR>a.	Clinicians require consistency of temperature effect for efficient therapeutic<BR>effect.  <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial using a Perineal Cold Pack in a non-clinical setting.<BR>  c.    After complete activation of the Pack the evaluator feels all surfaces of Pack and assesses for areas of inconsistent temperature effect.       <BR>3.	  (Efficiency of patient care and patient/staff safety) Perineal Cold Pack does not <BR>           leak under pressure.  <BR>  a.	Clinicians require leak-proof Pack for effective treatment and to minimize patient injury.  <BR>     b.    This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial using a Perineal Cold<BR>            Pack in a non-clinical setting.<BR>  c.	After complete activation of the Pack the evaluator applies moderate pressure to Pack between palms of hands and observes for leakage of contents.  <BR>       4.       (Efficiency of patient care) Perineal Cold Pack retains cooling effect for a<BR>                 minimum of 30 minutes.    <BR>a.	Clinicians require cooling effect for 20 minutes for efficient patient care.    <BR>b.    The criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial using a Perineal Cold<BR>       Pack in a non-clinical setting.<BR>                 c.    After complete activation of the Cold Pack the evaluator will assess for continued<BR>                        cooling effect after 30 minutes as timed by the evaluators watch.<BR>        5.      (Efficiency of patient care) Perineal Cold Pack has sufficient absorbency to <BR>                 hold fluids without excessive leaking/dripping/wetness.   <BR>                 a.    Clinicians require Cold Pack to absorb wound drainage/perspiration/body <BR>                        fluids during patient use (average expected post-partum drainage approximately<BR>                        80mL to 100mL/hour).   <BR>                 b.    The criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial using a Perineal Cold Pack in a<BR>                        non-clinical setting. <BR>                 c.     After complete activation of the Pack the evaluator will slowly pour 120mL<BR> (4 oz.) of tap water over the absorbent side of the Pack, adding additional water in increments of 60mL (2 oz.) each up to a maximum of 240mL (8 oz.), observe Pack for absorption/retention of water without excessive leaking/dripping/ wetness.  <BR>   <BR>     <BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis.  <BR>(1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  <BR>(2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.<BR>(3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>All vendors who meet the technical/company criteria as determined by the CPT will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  Vendors who  do not meet the technical/company criteria  will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative and not be contacted to submit pricing.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by COB 4:00PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.    <BR>END<BR>     <BR><BR>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR> The Northeast Region [Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1], a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 47 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of disposable Incentive Spirometers.     <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR> The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (Washington, DC), National Naval Medical Center (Bethesda, MD), Malcolm Grow Medical Center (Andrews AFB, MD), Dewitt Healthcare System (FT Belvoir, VA), Keller Army Community Hospital (Westpoint, NY), and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center (FT Meade, MD).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil <BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years total).  Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value, lowest overall cost factors, with pricing being least important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for the disposable Incentive Spirometers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for the disposable Incentive Spirometers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.

Requested product sample sets must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 14th  calendar day after the date of the notice requesting product sample sets.  Sample sets must be received by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the sample sets required by COB 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for product sample sets.  Vendors presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. <BR>The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for seven (7) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)Strongly Disagree; Two (2)Disagree; Three (3)Neutral; Four (4)Agree; and Five (5)Strongly Agree.   All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.  The CPT will determine the actual Clinically Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiativeat or near the 3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score target thresholddepending on the location of any break in vendors Total Averaged Scores (i.e., a gap between vendors Total Averaged Scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the 3.75 Total Averaged Score Clinically Acceptability target threshold in determining the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold.  Vendors whose Total Averaged Scores are below the actual Clinical Acceptability threshold will be determined to be Clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>To determine acceptability, the CPT will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  The CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical (patient care) setting.  The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinically Acceptability Target Threshold3.75 Vendor Total Averaged Score.        <BR>1.	(Ease of use encourages active patient involvement in care) The internal float device is able to move freely within inspiratory flow chamber.  <BR>a.	A freely moving float device is able to be raised by patients inspired breaths.  This provides respiratory exercise. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator observes for free-flow of internal float device during patient use and that the internal float device returns to bottom of the chamber between each exercise breath during patient use.      <BR>2.	(Adjustable goal indicator provides adaptability to various patients breathing efforts)    Adjustable goal indicator (volume-oriented device) is easy to reposition and remains <BR>stationary after adjustment.   <BR>  a.	An adjustable goal indicator allows clinician and patient to assess exercise <BR>         progress.<BR>  b.	This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>  c.	The evaluator will manually slide goal indicator up and down and observe for  ease of re-positioning, and observe that the goal indicator remains stationary during patient use.       <BR>3.	(Easily read graphics facilitate active patient involvement in care) Graphics indicating inspiratory volume/flow are clearly marked on the spirometer. <BR>a.	Highly visible graphics (indicating inspiratory flow rate/volume) helps patient perform and monitor their own breathing exercises without supervision.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will visually observe that inspiratory volume/flow can be clearly identified by patient during use.  <BR>4.	(Patient Comfort) Mouthpiece enables a comfortable, tight seal for optimal breathing exercise.    <BR>a.	A tight seal of mouth piece is necessary for efficient breathing exercise results.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated by five (5) trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.	The evaluator will observe for comfortable, tight seal with breathing exercises during patient use.  <BR><BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis.  <BR>(1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region. This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  <BR>(2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.<BR>(3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>All vendors who meet the technical/company criteria as determined by the CPT will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  Vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative and not be contacted to submit pricing. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  Price quotes must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day.  Those vendors that fail to respond as required by 4:00PM EDT/EST on the 14th calendar day will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendor MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Where lower uncommitted Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall NOT quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide a quote on discounts in response to this RFRIAQ.   Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products will be disqualified.      <BR>       Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.    <BR>END<BR><BR>     <BR><BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE
26 August 2008


The Headquarters (HQ) Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Airfield Operations, HQ AETC/A3OF, Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas 78150, hereby formally announces the intent to award a firm-fixed purchase order on a sole source basis to Systems Atlanta, Inc. (SAI).  This is a one-time equipment and associated software purchase.  The equipment and software required are (1) SAIs Information Display/Dissemination System (IDS5) software on pre-configured workstation hardware platform [Air Force nomenclature is Airfield Automation System (AFAS)]; (2) SAIs IDS5 interface software for the Starcaster Digital Automated Terminal Information Service (D-ATIS); (3) the Starcaster D-ATIS; and (4) ELO Touch Monitors (19) and associated support.  This total solution is required at each control tower for 9 locations within AETC.

The proposed contract action is for equipment/software with incidental installation services for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302.  This acquisition is partially a follow-on effort to an Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) upgrade project that was originally centrally funded.  Over the past couple of years, the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) centrally funded installation of AFAS equipment (SAIs IDS5 platforms) at ATC facilities AF-wide via contract with SAI; however, the contract has expired.  Due to limited AFFSA funding, only 2 of 3 operating positions in control towers received IDS5 equipment, necessitating this A3OF initiative to fund IDS5 installations for the remaining position at each of 9 towers.  In addition to many other capabilities designed to reduce controller workload and consolidate multiple segregated displays and control systems into one single focal point for data access, a key feature of IDS5 is its ability to directly interface with AF weather equipment and display critical weather information used by ATC to formulate manual broadcasts of weather information to aviators using legacy ATIS equipment.  The task of manually formulating and broadcasting ATIS messages becomes especially demanding during inclement or rapidly changing weather conditions since ATC must always ensure the most current weather information is continuously and accurately relayed to pilots.  A3OF seeks to further reduce ATCs demanding workload while simultaneously enhancing flight safety by automating ATIS message broadcasts through purchase and installation of SAIs IDS5 Starcaster ATIS interface software, in conjunction with purchase and installation of the Starcaster D-ATIS and associated peripherals on a common IDS5 (AFAS) workstation hardware platform, which is the only method for achieving the desired level of automation due to SAIs proprietary design of both IDS5 and the IDS5 Starcaster ATIS interface software.  Acquisition of ELO Touch Monitors to replace previously installed display monitors used with IDS5 (AFAS) will complete this overall initiative.  Providing controllers with touch screen monitors will greatly reduce the time required to access vital information, emergency checklists, etc., used in the day-to-day control of air traffic by eliminating the need to use a legacy mouse/trackball.

This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the Contracting Officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the Governments requirement with commercial items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For specific questions, please contact the Contracts Manager, 1st Lt Antony J. Barrios, at antony.barrios@randolph.af.mil or telephone (210) 652-2122, or the Contracting Officer, Mr. Andrew Feutz, at andrew.feutz@randolph.af.mil or telephone (210) 652-6487.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with MinXray 3611 Commercial Avenue, Northbrook, IL 60062, as the only responsible source that can provide the Portable Medical X-Ray Unit as requirement by Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.

Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command has a need for a Portable Medical X-ray system including the MinXray PowerPlus unit, Gas Spring Portable Mobile Stand with 16" Wheels and Transport case by Hardigg.  After removing from case, system acts a two-wheeled cart allowing movement to desired location and, with the use of the gas springs, only takes a few seconds to position from transporting mode to deployed mode.  The x-ray tube, CPU, and controls are all in one monobloc tubehead, alleviating the need for interconnecting cables between each component, all of which allows the user the ability to be ready more quickly and reduce patient waiting times.  The PowerPlus operates over the range of 100-260 VAC, 50/60 Hz, by sensing the input voltage and automatically switching. This Portable X-ray system will be replacing an older MinXray model that has very similar user interface reducing the training requirements.  Any other system would consume additional time and resources and may increase the probability of an operator error, resulting in unsuccessful outcomes.

Items being purchased in this acquisition:
Two Portable Medical X-Ray Units, CAT#:  MXRSLW: each including HF120/60HPPWV Power Plus portable x-ray unit, XGSMKIVLW stand and HF100HSTC military specification transport case. Six each operators manuals and service manuals.

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by MinXray, Inc.

<DESC>The United States Department of the Treasury, Departmental Offices, Procurement Services Division, Washington, DC is issuing this sources sought synopsis to identify potential contractors that have the capacity and qualifications to provide seized and forfeited property contract management services.

Potential contractors shall provide, in accordance with the information and instructions herein, a Statement of Capability (SOC) for their qualifications for a potential contract.  Services include, but are not limited to: custody, management, and disposition of seized/forfeited property through the use of nationwide or regional contracts which collectively are operational in all 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all U.S. Territories.    Seized property can include vehicles, vessels, aircraft, firearms, hazardous materials, counterfeit goods and other general property. The Department of the Treasury will consider suggestions for subdivision of work or contracts by property type (such as vehicles exclusively), geographical regions (such as regional or national coverage), and/or service type (such as destructions or sales exclusively).  See Attachment A for data regarding the amount and type of property historically involved in seized and forfeited property contract management services.  

Under the existing contract, three centralized storage facilities are utilized for the management of property.  In California, there is approximately 500,000 square feet of warehouse space that can accommodate 50,000 pallets.  In New Jersey, there is approximately 360,000 square feet of property that can accommodate 40,000 pallets.  In Florida, there is 60,000 square feet of property that can accommodate 2,000 pallets.  Space expansion in Florida, in the amount of 250,000 additional square feet of warehouse space that could accommodate 20,000 pallets, is currently under review.

Potential contractors shall capture, report and maintain seizure documentation and related costs regarding the above activities and be on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including holidays.  The objectives include: minimizing contract costs, minimizing the time for receipt and disposition of property, minimizing adverse incidents and complaints; and maximizing cooperation with, services to, the federal government.   

The Contractor shall be required to develop a document control system to assist in automating, controlling, referencing, filing, and retrieving of correspondence between their office and the Government. 

The Contractor may be asked by the Government to provide pre seizure services for general property including vehicles, aircrafts, vessels, machinery, and equipment.  Such services may require the pre positioning of resources (staffing and equipment) prior to the actual seizure of the property and may include but are not limited to:  towing to a different site, lien determinations, dropping and replacing gas tanks in vehicles, providing services to facilitate inspection, tire breakdown, and transport of vehicles to Government x ray facilities for the inspection services. 

The Contractor shall be available at all times to take custody of all property at the time, date, and location designated by the Government. The Contractor shall arrange for safe, secure, and cost effective transportation of the property from the point of acceptance to storage. Property shall be stored in the most cost-effective method available to preclude any deterioration of the property, so that the overall condition of the property is maintained as it was at the time of acceptance.  The Contractor must be able to locate and provide property within an hours notice. 

The Contractor shall control access to property stored under this contract. The Contractor must maintain records for all property including but not limited to billing, accounting, and storage of property. The Contractor shall maintain and preserve property as necessary to ensure that it retains its overall condition from the time of acceptance until disposition. The Contractor shall arrange and conduct the sale of property upon receipt of instructions from the Government. 

The Contractor shall publicly advertise the sale of property in order to generate maximum competition. The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a risk management plan.  The Contractor is responsible for detecting, identifying, and managing hazardous materials according to Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations that apply to environmental quality standards in each community where property is maintained or destroyed.  Upon request by the Government, the Contractor is responsible for assisting the participating agencies in determining the value of property through a certified third party appraisal.

This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Department of the Treasury, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.     An award will not be made on information received in response to this notice.     If the solicitation is issued, source selection procedures will be used, which will require offerors to submit technical experience, management plan, past performance, price and other factors for evaluations.

<DESC>This serves as a Notice of Intent to purchase HighJump Software maintenance subscription services from 3M.  This Notice is SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FY 2009 FUNDS pursuant to FAR Clause 52.232-18.  This notice does not obligate funds.  The Government intends to purchase MAINTENANCE services for the following software licenses that were previously purchased under a competitive award:  

Loftware Print Server Starter Edition, qty 43;
Loftware Label Manager Full Edition, qty 4;
Crystal Reports 10 Advanced Developer w/Limited Workgroup license, qty 2;
Crystal Reports Enterprise, Embedded Edition, qty 1;
SCA Concurrent User Licenses, qty 1;
SCA Warehouse Advantage, qty 100;
SCA Terminal Device License, qty 51;
SCA Advantage Dashboard, qty 1;
SCA Unlimited Named Browser, qty 31;
SCA Advantage Link for XML, qty 1;

In 2002 a competitive procurement was awarded for the Sharpe Warehouse Consolidation project to Tompkins Associates.  HighJump Software was recommended by Tompkins and accepted by GSA.  It was also considered the reasonable and acceptable solution based on price.  
The General Services Administration Federal Supply Service (FSS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) purchased HighJump for 9 Windows 2000 server systems, which are housed at the Sharpe Depot in French Camp, CA.  These systems support the Warehouse Management System (WMS) application at Sharpe and are central to GSAs mission.
The WMS system is used to manage storage and process inbound and outbound of material and is based on HighJump software products.

HighJump Software is proprietary, and no other vendor is authorized to manufacture or resell the product.  The vendor is qualified on the basis that the software has been deployed as a standard at the GSA Sharpe Depot.

All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 703 605 5588, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.  RE:  Note 22.

Notice of Contractor Personnel Security Requirements
Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) (See Note i) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I. (1) Long-Term Contractor Personnel:
In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term (See Note ii) contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:(a) Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);
(b) Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;
(c) Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:
-- High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)
-- Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)
-- Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
(d) The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:
(1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;
(2) Favorable fingerprint results;
(3) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note iii)
(4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and
(5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) (See Note iv) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). (e) Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the FBI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
(2) Short-Term Contractor Personnel:
It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a.and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
(a) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;
(b) Favorable fingerprint results;
(c) Favorable credit report, if required; (See Note v) and
(d) Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.
A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.  For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.
(3) Intermittent Contractors:
An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.
(a) For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.
(b) Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.
(c) Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.
(d) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.
(e) If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.
(4) An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.
(5) The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.
_____________________________________________________________________________
NOTES:
i  FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf
ii Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.
iii For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.
iv In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM's instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code "3" must be placed in block "B" of the "Agency Use Only" section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.
v For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

Certification of data removal will be performed by the Contractors project manager and a letter confirming certification will be delivered to the CO within 15 days of termination of contractor work.
b. Data Security:
By acceptance of, or performance on, this contract, the contractor agrees that with respect to the data identified in paragraph a, in the event of any actual or suspected breach of such data (i.e., loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, access for an unauthorized purpose, or other unauthorized access, whether physical or electronic), the contractor will immediately (and in no event later than within one hour of discovery) report the breach to the DOJ CO and the contracting officer's technical representative (COTR).  If the data breach occurs outside of regular business hours and/or neither the CO or the COTR can be reached, the contractor shall call the DOJ Computer Emergency Readiness Team (DOJCERT) at 1-866-US4-CERT
(1-866-874-2378) within one hour of discovery of the breach. The contractor shall also notify the CO as soon as possible during regular business hours.
c. Personally Identifiable Information Notification Requirement:
The contractor further certifies that it has a security policy in place that contains procedures to promptly notify any individual whose personally identifiable information (as defined by OMB) was, or is reasonably believed to have been, breached.

Faith-based and Community-based organizations can submit offers/bids/quotations equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.

Freedom of Information Act
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and its amendments have resulted in an increasing number of requests to Federal Agencies for copies of Technical/Management and Business Proposals from other than Government sources.
The offeror should identify information in its Technical/Management and Business Proposals the offeror believes should be withheld from these sources, on the basis the proposals consist of "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential" (exemption (b) (4) of the FOIA). This identification will assist in the decision by a responsible federal official to disclose or withhold the requested information.
If an offeror considers elements of its proposal to be exempt under FOIA, ensure the following notice is annotated on the title page of the proposal:
Elements of this document, as identified on individual pages, are considered by the submitter to be privileged or confidential trade secrets or commercial or financial information not subject to mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Material considered privileged or confidential on this basis is contained on pages ____.  The offeror must annotate each individual item it considers privileged or confidential under the FOIA exemption with the following notice:  The data or information is considered confidential or privileged, and not subject to mandatory disclosure under the FOIA. All information in an offeror's proposal not designated may be subject to automatic public disclosure if it is requested under the FOIA. It must be emphasized that under the FOIA no information is automatically exempt from public disclosure. However, no disclosures will be made without careful evaluation, giving due regard to the need for
safeguarding material considered privileged or confidential by the offeror. It is Department of Justice policy to withhold whenever possible material that is genuinely privileged or confidential.

The proposed technology will be evaluated on its ability to meet all of the requirements listed in part (vi) of this solicitation.  Contractors shall furnish as part of their quotation all descriptive material necessary for the government to determine whether their service meets the technical requirements.  The technical proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Minimally Acceptable, Acceptable, or Exceptional.

STATEMENT OF WORK: Background:

For over 30 years the Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance (DSMICA) has assisted industry by providing technical and regulatory assistance to small manufacturers to help them comply with FDA requirements for medical devices. DSMICA is one of several divisions within the Office of Communication, Education, and Radiation Programs, within the Center For Devices & Radiological Health (CDRH).  DSMICA has five major programs:

1)  Educates and advises the device industry and helps them comply with a wide array of FDA regulations; 

2)  Educates consumers about issues and problems with medical devices and radiation-emitting products:

3)  Educates and trains foreign government officials on the US regulatory process;

4)  Coordinates global harmonization, Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA) and other international agreements; and

5)  Manages the CDRH Third Party Program.

DSMICAS staff answers questions by phone, FAX, E-mail, and in person.  They are professionals trained in device laws, regulations and procedures. They quickly provide real time answers to most questions. DSMICA develops and makes available electronically a wide variety of How To guidance to help industry comply with regulatory requirements. Examples include premarket notification [510(k)], premarket approval (PMA), investigational device exemptions (IDE), good manufacturing practices (GMP/QS), establishment registration and device listing, and Electronic Product (Radiation emitting) submissions. DSMICA staff routinely participates at workshops, symposiums, seminars, and conferences speaking on medical device and radiological health regulations. 

At this time we are exploring the use of contractors to provide cost effective responses to email inquiries from consumers and other non-industry stakeholders.  The contractor could perform this work at DSMICA offices in Rockville or at a location of their choosing, within EST time zone.

STATEMENT OF WORK: Background:

Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that is indicated for the prevention of thromboembolic events in children with heart disease or whom have undergone surgery for repair of congenital heart defects.  As in adults, it is also used in pediatrics to treat patients with atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic disease.  Warfarin consists of a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomers which are metabolized by differing pathways.  S-warfarin, the more potent enantiomer, is mainly metabolized to 7 -hydroxywarfarin by cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9). CYP2C9 is polymorphically expressed and variant alleles (CYP2C9*2 and *3) have been shown to result in reduced clearance of free warfarin in both adults and children.  This reduction leads to an increase in the anticoagulant effect of and a consequent decrease in the mean daily dose required to maintain the international normalized ratio (INR) or the prothrombin time (PT) within the target therapeutic range. 

Initiation of warfarin treatment is often problematic in both children and adults because of multiple factors that lead to wide variations in drug response.  Physiologic and pharmacologic factors, such as interacting drugs and illnesses, can affect both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin.  Factors that affect the intestinal availability of vitamin K (e.g., dietary intake, concomitant antimicrobial administration) and/or the synthetic or metabolic fate of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (e.g., hepatocellular disease) can also affect warfarin pharmacodynamics.   This is concerning since hemorrhage is the major risk of warfarin therapy.  Bleeding events in adult patients receiving warfarin therapy have been reported to be 7.6 to 16.5 per hundred patient years with major or life-threatening bleeds occurring every 1.3 to 2.7 per hundred patient-years.  Although major bleeding can occur even at warfarin doses that are considered to be therapeutic, the risk of serious hemorrhage rises proportionately with increasing intensity of anticoagulation. 

Several investigations conducted in adult patients have suggested that genetic polymorphisms influence the safety and efficacy of warfarin. Previous studies have shown that patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased warfarin dose requirements. Patients with CYP2C9*2 or *3 variant alleles require lower mean daily doses and have more frequent INR values above the upper limit of the therapeutic range during the induction phase of warfarin therapy than patients carrying only wild-type alleles. These patients also required a longer time to achieve stable dosing, and had a significantly increased risk of serious or life threatening bleeding events when compared to patients with the CYP2C9*1/*1 (homozygous wild-type) genotype. Adult studies have also shown that the maintenance dose of warfarin is significantly related to genotype. Therefore, knowing the CYP2C9 genotypes of patients and adjusting the dose of warfarin based on this information before initiating warfarin therapy may improve the clinical safety and efficacy of the drug.

It has now been shown that polymorphic expression of CYP2C9 alone does not account for the variability in the dose-response relationship for warfarin.  Warfarin exerts its pharmacodynamic effect by inhibiting the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme complex (VKORC) which is responsible for recycling vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to vitamin K hydroquinone. Recently, the gene that encodes vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) has been identified. Point mutations in the gene encoding VKORC1 have been shown to lead to warfarin resistance and increased dose requirements.   Collectively, the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes have been shown to account for approximately 45% of the variability in warfarin dose requirements.     

The cumulative data obtained and available computer based clinical pharmacogenetic programs for warfarin dosing ignore implications for pediatric patients.  Because of the intrinsic developmental differences in the coagulation systems, adult guidelines for antithrombotic therapy cannot be extrapolated to pediatrics.  While several warfarin studies have been performed in children, there is a paucity of data regarding how developmental expression affects warfarin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.   This is especially true for VKORC1 where the patterns of developmental expression are not known.  Studies have also shown that body weight normalized unbound oral clearance for S-warfarin is significantly greater than that for adults and that developmental alterations occur for other proteins that influence the anticoagulation effect of warfarin (e.g., Protein C).
II. Purpose & Objective

Warfarin remains the mainstay of pediatric chronic anticoagulation therapy.  As in adults, the management of warfarin therapy is difficult and adverse effects are common.  Two distinct pediatric patient populations receive warfarin frequently; one population is the young children with complex congenital heart disease who have surgery and abnormal blood flow, and the other are the adolescent patients who have valve replacement.  Only three pharmacologic studies of warfarin in children have been conducted, and they suggest that developmental and genetic factors contribute to pediatric patient variability in response.

The purpose and Objectives of the study is to examine the relationship between warfarin dosing, CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms, and patient demographic factors in order to develop a warfarin dosing algorithm that can be validated for pediatric patients.
Hypothesis: DNA polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are predictive of warfarin dose requirements in children once a stable INR has been achieved.
III. Purpose & Objective

Pediatric centers with anticoagulation clinics will be recruited for participation, and one PPRU will coordinate the clinical centers.  The study will take place in two phases; a data collection phase which will generate sufficient data for the construction of a dosing nomogram, and a prospective phase in which patients will be randomized to routine management versus nomogram-guided dosing.  All studies will be IRB-approved at their site in order for them to participate.

Independently, and not as an agent of the U.S. Federal Government, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for:

A. Study Design
Patients less than 18 years of age who are currently followed by the participating institutions and who have received warfarin treatment for greater than 7 days within the past one year will be eligible for the study.   Patients and/or parents/guardians will be fully informed about the study during clinic visits and informed consent will be obtained from patients parent/guardian during these regularly scheduled visits or during scheduled laboratory visits that are performed as part of standard care.  When appropriate (i.e., age > 6 years), patient assent will be obtained.  

Once consent/assent is obtained, each subject will be given a study identification number. A sample of 1 mL of  whole blood (for genomic DNA) and 5mL of plasma (for warfarin R/S ratios and future studies) will be obtained with the routine blood draw. The blood sample will only be identified by the ID number. In some cases, a venipuncture will be required for patients who are not previously scheduled to have a blood test for clinical care.  This will be fully explained during the consent process.  Blood and plasma samples will be batched at the investigative sites and will be maintained at -70C until they are shipped to the Childrens Mercy Hospital Pediatric Clinical Pharmacology laboratory where the leukocyte DNA will be extracted (from whole blood) and genotype analysis will be performed.  The plasma warfarin R/S concentration ratio will be determined by quantitation of each enantiomer from plasma using a validated HPLC/MS/MS technique.  

Retrospective longitudinal review of data will then be performed and will include age, weight, height, gender, warfarin dose, other medical illness or medications, adverse effects, PT(prothrombin time), and INR(international normalized ratio).  These will be obtained from the existing patient records and documented under the study ID number.  The data will be analyzed along with the testing for genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C9 and VKORC1, and warfarin R/S ratios.

B. Subject Selection Criteria: 

1.	Recruitment of Subjects: 
Patients will be recruited from 2 hospital sites and 1 to 2 additional sites from the NICHD supported Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network that are known to have a substantial number of pediatric patients who receive warfarin.  

2.  Expected Sample Size:  Total study:  100      Number expected per study site: 34

3.  Inclusion Criteria:
 
Patients who are less than 18 years of age who have received warfarin treatment for more than 7 days.

4.	Exclusion Criteria:
Patients who have been on warfarin for less than 7 days or whom have been deemed to be non-compliant with treatment by the treating team will be excluded.


C. Data collection phase:  


Centers will recruit current and past patients on which they can collect DNA and data on the patients clinical course and laboratory monitoring.  When it can be coordinated with a blood draw, plasma will be obtained for an s-warfarin concentration.  The number of patients will be guided by the previous experience of the Pharmacometrics Division of OCP with adult warfarin patients.


D. Prospective evaluation phase:
 

Pediatric patients requiring warfarin therapy will be randomized to receive the standard of care or will be genotyped and have their warfarin dosing determined by a pediatric dosing nomogram.  The primary outcome measure will be time to stable INR.


E. Methods/Observations/Measurements:

Information on previous warfarin dosing, INR, illnesses, adverse effects and other medication use will be collected and analyzed on each patient from the time of initiation of the drug until the time of enrollment into the study. A database that contains information for each subject will be created and maintained by the coordinating.

Information will be analyzed in the Pharmacometrics Division, Office of Clinical Pharmacology, US Food and Drug Administration by NONMEM. The number of patients available (n=100) should be sufficient to develop a model of warfarin dosing that can account for greater than 50% of the variability in warfarin dosing, based upon adult studies.   It is anticipated that as in adults, a multiple regression model will be used to explore the relationships between measured covariates and warfarin dose to produce a desired INR (the response surrogate endpoint). Two working assumptions in developing a multivariable predictive model are that: (1) the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes will be included in all models developed, and (2) the magnitude of the genetic effects is a strong reason to assume that effects of other predictors will not be strictly additive, and interaction terms must be considered in the models.

F. Confidentiality of Subjects and Data

After enrollment in the study, each participant will be assigned a study ID number. This number will be used to identify the blood sample. The research nurse coordinator will enter all the data from the patient into the database using only the study ID number.  The blood samples will be analyzed without any personal identifiers and results given to the PI. The investigators involved in direct care to the patient will be unaware of the genetic test results produced as part of this research investigation and will provide routine care using clinical information (which may include CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype) performed by each study site.

1.	What subject identifiers are used in: 

a.	study documents to funding agency
Subjects will be identified only by a unique study number

b.	study documents retained at CMH 
Subjects will be identified only by a unique study number


5.	Where will data be stored and how will confidentiality be maintained? 
Data will be stored in a locked drawer and locked computer file in the PI's office.  Access to the key will be limited to the PI and a study nurse coordinator. The data that will be entered into the database the computer will be coded, and the link between the coded data and the subjects will be kept in the research files in the locked cabinet in the PIs office.

3.	
Will tissue/blood samples be stored beyond the end of the study?   
	Data will be kept after completion of this study for 10 years. Identifiers will be destroyed after the completion of the study.  This will be clearly stated on the consent form. 


G. Metric for Evaluating impact:

The impact of these studies are to establish a new standard of care for pediatric patients who require warfarin therapy.  If we can establish a warfarin dosing nomogram that functions more efficiently than traditional fixed arbitrary dosing at rapidly achieving a stable INR in warfarin-treated children, then the outcome will be a major advance in drug therapy for pediatric patients.  The nomogram will be available to all clinicians via the Internet, and it will establish a new standard of care for warfarin dosing in pediatric patients.


V. Deliverables and Timeline
Data collection phase:
Recruitment of centers and IRB approval:  4 months
Data and DNA collection and analysis:  8 months
Data Analysis, Nomogram formulation, Investigator meeting: 3 months
      Prospective evaluation phase:
	Patient recruitment, data collection:  12 months

As such, the DSFM Mechanical Engineering program is requesting to purchase software with the following characteristics: Solves large scale models (> 1 million elements), Wide range of linear and non-linear analyses, Sophisticated material models (elastic, hyperelastic, shape memory, plastic, etc.) as well as user-defined material models, Predefined and user-define contact definitions, Simulation software is capable of projects for biomedical applications that span multiple aspects of physics, Software with efficient exchange of data between simulations of different physical phenomena. An example is fluid structure interaction where two way data exchange is required to correctly capture the behavior of a system where fluid forces and pressures affect the structural response of the system and vise versa, Software that possesses a unified and common working environment to handle both fluid and solid analysis capabilities, Software that possesses advanced geometry integration, manipulation and computational mesh creation tools, and Complex computational fluid dynamic capabilities, such as laminar flow, turbulent flow, pulsatile flow, includes analysis using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. 

 (vi) DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS: STATEMENT OF WORK:  
A. An integrated Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a computational analysis tool that can be used to predict the mechanical safety of medical devices.  Currently, this computational tool is used by regulated industry to help demonstrate the safety of their medical devices.  Therefore, a great need exists at FDA for expertise in the implementation of integrated FEA and CFD for medical devices, its strengths and its limitations.  A core thrust of the CDRH/OSEL/DSFM Mechanical Engineering Program is to analyze medical device failure and mechanical performance.  
B. A core thrust of the CDRH/OSEL/DSFM Mechanical Engineering Program is to understand the failure mechanisms of medical devices. By using this engineering stress analysis software, we will be able to better understand failure mechanisms of medical devices that cannot be performed with our existing experimental testing capabilities.  In addition, this software will aid in providing recommendations to companies during the submission process to insure that accurate stress analyses are performed. This software will be installed on a stand-alone scientific workstation.  It is not intended to be enrolled in the FDA Scientific Network, and is NOT to be connected to the FDA Administrative Network.

C. Currently there are very limited methods in CDRH/OSEL/DSFM to perform localized stress analysis of complex medical devices. Experimental testing can only provide global information regarding the failure properties of these complex devices. However, integrated FEA and CFD software is necessary for estimating the local distribution of stresses/strains within a device. This type of computational analysis is imperative to determining stress concentrations and insuring the safety of devices from pre-mature mechanical failure.

D. Overall, we anticipate this software will aid in better evaluations of safety against failure in a variety of medical devices. For example, we plan to investigate the effects of vessel deformations on stent mechanical integrity. The only method to accomplish this task is using integrated FEA and CFD software to estimate the local stress distribution within the stent. In addition, this software will help us further participate in standards working groups, such as ASTM F04, that investigate methods to characterize the failure of medical devices and write guidance on the use of integrated FEA and CFD to predict device safety. 

E. Solves large scale models (>1 million elements), Linear analyses, Non-linear analyses,  Sophisticated Material Models, Contact definitions, Complex computational Fluid Dynamics Capabilities, and Integrated Fluid-Solid Interactions capabilities are the product outcome required by the software.

F. Research projects for biomedical applications require a simulation software tool kit that spans multiple aspects of physics. These include fluidic and structural/mechanical. For each aspect, high end technology is required to capture the complex, non-linear behavior and response of the system and the materials involved.  The geometry of the system to be considered can also be highly complex.

G. This simulation technology should be composed of the advanced geometry integration, manipulation and computational mesh creation tools available.

H. In addition, the project demands the efficient exchange of data between simulations of different physical phenomena. An example is fluid structure interaction where two way data exchange is required to correctly capture the behavior of a system where fluid forces and pressures affect the structural response of the system and vise versa. 

I. Software that possesses a unified and common working environment to handle both fluid and solid analysis capabilities.
J.  Data Rights -  The Government will maintain ownership and unlimited rights to all 
applications, source codes, and data generated in the performance of and at the end of the 
task.  "Unlimited rights" means the rights of the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, 
prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and 
display publicly, in any manner and for any purpose, and to have or permit others
 to do so.

Electronic processing tasks are accomplished using custom-built processes expressly for the Captiva IA Information capture System.  Captiva software is approved for use by FDAs FASTAR.

IA allows administrators flexibility to design customized capture flows using VB scripts, SDKs, and source code.  IA is a true client/server architecture that utilizes clients to process work while data resides safely on a firewall-protected FDA domain server. The scan module is used to create electronic images from paper submissions or accept electronic input from other source.  Image enhancement implements a rigorous, fully automated image enhancement process.  This involves de-speckling, noise reduction, deskewing, page orientation, and border removal, as well as more than a dozen other image processing functions.  The rescan module will permit user intervention to adjust the image, if an operator flags the page as unacceptable for optical character recognition (OCT).  Index is used to remove the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Confidential Business Information (CBI) and name the folders, to facilitate a bridge or export process.  The CAPCON module serves as a hub which controls the SCANSOFT and PRIME RECOGNITION OCR modules. These modules perform both high-precision text- and image-based analysis techniques.  IA Export provides ODBC export to the Oracle database.

<SUBJECT>Renewal of Varolii Brand Name Notification Services
<SOLNBR>N8G28133AS01
<RESPDATE>082808
<CONTACT>Scott J Hardin, Phone 314-676-0203, Fax 314-676-3010, Email scott.j.hardin@nga.mil
<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency intends to award a sole source contract to Varolii Inc. for the following requirement:  

The period of performance for this service renewal shall be 30 Sep 2008 to 29 Sep 2009. 

CLIN 0001: Renewal of Professional Notification Package, (Qty = 1) , this CLIN shall include coverage for 5000 recipients, 5 minute priority delivery (400 voice messages and 400 text messages every 5 minutes), Unlimited Business Continuity voice messages per year for US and Canada, Unlimited Worldwide text messages, Standard Technical support from 8:00AM  6:00PM EST Mon-Fri, Severity 1: 24 hrs/7 days a week support, Severity 2, 3 ,4   8:00AM  6:00PM EST Mon-Fri support, Coverage for unlimited contact devices, 5 Administrator Licenses, 20 Sub-Administrator Licenses 

CLIN 0002: Renewal of Additional Sub-Administrator Licenses, (Qty = 30) 

CLIN 0003: Renewal Agreement of additional 16,000 individual Database Recipient Records (This will bring the total number of recipients for NGA to 21,000)  

CLIN 0004: Renewal of Message Center Service: State of the Art Inbound Calling System for Employee Communications and Accountability, (Qty = 1), this CLIN shall include capabilities to update message content throughout an incident lifecycle to inform employees of latest information pertaining to the event, Ability to post emergency Information to the Message Center, Up to 3 Toll-Free Numbers for inbound calls, Real time reporting enabling NGA to account for personnel, All software updates, maintenance, system support, telecom lines, etc., Standard Technical Support

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: Varolii Inc. is the sole provider of Varolii proprietary notification services. Varolii notification services are currently in use by NGA. Interruption of this service would put NGA at risk in meeting NGA's mission of supporting National Defense objectives, Homeland Security, and Humanitarian support. Additionally, the Varolii services solution is the only known notification system that meets the following requirements: 1. The solution must not employ foreign nationals, 2. The solution must be based in the Untied States, 3. The solution must be a hosted solution, 4. The solution must have more than one secure data warehouse geographically separated, 5. The solution must provide resiliency of service and data with respect to multiple telephone providers. 

Due to the fact that Varolii notification services are already in use at NGA, switching to a new notification service would not meet NGA's requirements of form, fit, and function, nor could NGA change over to a new notification solution to meet our required start date of 30 September.  Transition to a new notification system would require a large amount of time to test the new system and to re-train our personnel to use the new system. Such a transition would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs. 

The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, with no obligation to the offeror by the Government.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11. The provision at FAR 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.
Only one award will be made to the offeror who best meets the schedule needs of NGA. 

Offerors are required to submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification--Commercial Items, with their offer. 

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. 
The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition, with the following clauses: 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government with Alternate I; 52.222-3, Convict Labor; 52.222-19, Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies; 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-39, Notification of Employee Rights Concerning Payment of Union Dues or Fees; 52.225-13, Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases; 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration. The clause at DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition with the following clauses: FAR 52.203-3, Gratuities; DFARS 252.225-7001 Buy American Act and Balance of Program; 252.225-7036, Buy American Act--Free Trade Agreements--Balance of Payments Program; 252.227-7015, Technical Data--Commercial Items; 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data; 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests; 252.243-7002, Requests for Equitable Adjustment; and 252.247-7023, Transportation of Supplies by Sea.

<DESC>The Institute seeks a contractor to provide technical assistance in the area of graphic design to assist in the development of all Institute products over the next two years.  Although the Institute has a general idea of the types of products it will be producing in the upcoming year, it is not possible to identify each specific product or the exact number of products at this time.  For that reason, this acquisition will be structured as a Task Order contract, in which the Institute will issue task orders to the winning contractor for each new product to be designed.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a One-Dimensional Universal Length Measuring Machine (ULM) to be used by the Engineering Metrology Group at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background
The Engineering Metrology Group provides measurement services in the area of dimensional metrology for customer artifacts from 0.1 mm up to 1000 mm in length.  Our current universal length measuring machine is a SIP 550 and has been retrofitted with a laser interferometer because the inherent scale accuracy of the instrument as procured was not sufficient for the measurements required.  The system still uses the original control board and computer system for all motor controlled movements of the instrument and the electronic measurement force setting control.  In the instruments current state, instrument can not be serviced but can be completely refurbished.   The major concern is that failure of the instruments controller and/or PC could mean that several standard measurement services would be indefinitely halted.  After researching the upgrade/refurbishment of the current SIP 550 system with Heidenhains best linear scale revealed that the structure and design of the instrument will not support the desired performance.  The ultimate goal was to improve the machines scale accuracy, thus making the laser interferometer system available for other applications and changing the scale measurement to one that was less sensitive to environmental fluctuations (i.e., atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure (relative humidity)).  

This is a BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agencys needs.***


***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):

The instrument shall provide PC controlled movement: in the measure direction, z-axis support table movement, and electronic measurement force setting/control.  The instrument shall be capable of measuring inside and outside lengths and diameters and the major diameter and pitch diameter of straight and tapered thread gages.  The support stage of the instrument shall minimally provide manual adjustments for part rotation, part translation front to back (y-direction), and part tilt in the XZ plane.  The support table must provide for free-floating movement parallel to the length measurement direction to provide part self positioning between the instrument contacts aided only by the applied force of the instrument.  In addition to z-axis motion control, the z-axis should be retrofitted with a linear encoder and position readout allowing precise vertical positioning of the artifact to 0.05 mm.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Coherent, Santa Clara, CA for a replacement laser.  The requirement is for a Chameleon System, Ultra (II): 80 MHz (RoHS) , #1117782.  The Chameleon ULTRA II hands-free ultrafast Ti:Sapphire laser provides femtosecond pulses tuning more than 400nm, from 680nm to 1080nm, with a peak power of  >3.3 W, in a single box.  Fully automated for the ultimate ease-of-use the Chameleon is operated either via a simple menu-driven interface located on the power supply, or via an external computer.  Providing high power and superb beam quality, the Chameleons sealed design and Verdi pump laser ensures it is the quietest, most efficient and most reliable hands-free ultrafast laser system available.  Requiring only single-phase AC power and operating for thousands of hours without maintenance, the system includes: Optimized beam shape, pulse width, broadest tuning range ensures the highest peak powers are delivered for microscope-based imaging applications.  Compact laser head, power supply with integrated control interface, and closed-loop water chiller.   The patent-pending MRU-X1 compact, closed-lop air re-circulator, which provides effortless tuning through atmospheric water vapour absorption lines above 920nm, without the need for an external purge.  The Power Pulse control system, which ensures output power and pulse width are optimized automatically at all wavelengths and at all times.  An onboard spectrometer that measures laser output wavelength and bandwidth, which can be interfaced to an external computer via a USB connection on the laser head.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 13.106-1(2)(b).  The cited authority is applicable because only the  Coherent is supported by the operating software of Zeiss Instruments in conjunction with the operation of the Zeiss LSM-510 Confocal Microscope.  This coupled with the generous discount offered by Coherent for trade in of the nonfunctioning existing laser make this procurement the only practical choice for our application.  This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt form the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest price, technically acceptable source.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Bruker Biospin Corporation.
The proposed procurement concerns the upgrade of the MRI Sections Bruker Biospin 9.4 Tesla (400 MHz) NMR Spectrometer from the 1996-era DMX console to a state-of-art Advance III console.   Due to the age of our NMR Spectrometer and the difficulty in obtaining replacement parts, the DMX console can no longer be fully supported by Bruker under our annual parts-only service contract.  New equipment to be furnished by Bruker:
Advance III two-bay console containing: BSMS shim and level controller with Digital lock, BLAH-1000 1 kW RF amplifier for protons, two BLAX-1000 1kW RF amplifiers for heteronuclear channels X and Y, second generations digital receive (2G-DR), three SGU-based RF channels, gradient controller, digital received unit (DRU), BVT-3000 digital temperature control unit, MAS II control unit for magic angle spinning solids NMR, Linux workstation with pre-loaded Bruker TopSpin and ParaVision software.   Additions to existing microimaging rack for compatibility with Avance III console: GREAT Master Unit, B compensation unit, BST upper shim stack, BOSS widebore shim set.  Preamplifier assembly, containing:
LNA preamplifier for protons, LNA preamplifier for fluorine-19, two high power preamplifiers for heteronuclear channels X and Y, high-resolution preamplifier for deuterium, HPPR/2 broadband preamplifier and control unit and tune/match display.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because Bruker Biospin Corporation is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.    The overall objective of this procurement is to ensure that researchers at the NIA, IRP continue to have access to a modern NMR spectrometer with full microimaging, solids, and high-resolution capabilities that can be fully supported by its manufacturer under warranty and service contracts.  To achieve this objective at an affordable cost, we propose to retain Bruker RF probes and microimaging gradient equipment from the existing system since these will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future.  In order to do this, we must upgrade the DMX console to another Bruker product since the probes and gradient equipment are of a proprietary design and will function only when connected to a Bruker console.  An additional consideration in choosing a vendor for this upgrade is the fact that replacing the existing console with a non-Bruker product would entail a major change in hardware and software that would have profound effects on the data obtained from the instrument.  Based on the need to maintain consistency with experimental protocols and data published by our laboratory, interoperability with our 7 Tesla 30 cm MRI scanner and an affordable upgrade, we conclude that the only viable option is to trade in our existing DMX400 console toward the purchase of a new Avance III console from Bruker Biospin.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced, technically acceptable source.

<SUBJECT>ASSESSMENT OF DERELICT FISHING GEAR
<SOLNBR>WC133F-0-8-RQ-1100SLW
<RESPDATE>090508
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), and Florida Keys National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), Key West, FL intends to procure services to produce an assessment of derelict fishing gear (DFG or gear) in the wider Caribbean. DFG and related debris contributes to broad degradation of the Caribbean region's economic and ecological resources. Commissioning of this assessment is consistent with the findings of a workshop NOAA and Department of State held on DFG in the Caribbean at the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in July, 2007. The workshop brought together relevant experts from the region who were able to exchange scientific and technical information, and where they concluded that efforts to address the problem are hampered by a lack of data and technical knowledge. The primary recommendation of that workshop was to conduct a diagnostic study to describe and quantify DFG in the Wider Caribbean, within the context of fisheries management and the prevention of loss of fishing gear.
<p>The assessment report should contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. A minimum of 5 Caribbean states to be included in the assessment. <br />2. Quantify and describe the types of gear used by fishery and by region and/or country. <br />3. Quantify and describe, as much as possible, the amount of gear lost, by gear type and other reasonable factors.<br />4. Quantify and describe regional and/or country differences in gear-loss rate, and potential reasons for these differences.<br />5. Describe weather and other conditions that contribute to gear loss.<br />6. Describe regional and/or country efforts to address gear loss.<br />7. Describe regional and/or country efforts to reduce DFG impacts (rot cord, degradable panels, natural materials). <br />8. Describe the methodology as to how this information will be gathered.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be able to:</p>
<p>-Demonstrate education or experience in data collection relating to fisheries and marine resources in the wider Caribbean <br />-Demonstrate education or experience in fishing gears used in the wider Caribbean, and/or with DFG encountered in the wider Caribbean</p>
<p>-Demonstrate education or experience in how DFG impacts and interacts with the marine environment <br />-Demonstrate education or experience in data analysis and report writing relevant or similar to the subject matter of this project (DFG in the Caribbean)</p>
<p>Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation. The NAICS code for this action is 541990. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation on or about August 26, 2008. Potential offerors are encouraged to periodically return to this site to obtain the Request for Quotation. Faxed requests can be sent to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker. The government requires that all contractors doing business with the government must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505. The government now requires all contractors submit their Certification and Representation thru the on-line Business Partner Network (BPN). The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Contractors should go on-line at www.bpn.gov. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in CCR and BPN. Responses should be faxed to 816-426-7470. Attn: Sharon Walker.</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description: </span></strong></p>
<p>This is a solicitation from the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisitions Division (CRAD). The requirement is for monitoring the coral reef fish utilization for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and recruitment Connectivity between the Florida Keys and Meso-American Reefs in accordance with the requirements in the statement of work for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service, Miami, FL.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction<br /></span></strong></p>
<p>In the Atlantic Ocean, highest levels of abundance and biodiversity of corals and tropical reef/seagrass fishes occur within the Meso American atoll and barrier reef system along the Yucatan coast. There are many reported mass spawning aggregations of various commercially and ecologically important coral reef fishes. Recent conservation efforts have resulted in a portion of these sites being designated as Marine Protect Areas. In order to ensure the sustainability MPA as integrated ecosystems it is essential to understand the connections between populations, juvenile nursery areas, and the physical regime of the coastal area. It is also important to locate vulnerable sites where fish spawning aggregations occur, and to determine what regions within the reserves, due to oceanographic processes and habitat availability, are suitable for recruitment and settlement of juvenile fish. <br />As part of this project NOAA and El Colegio de La Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) conducted joint research cruises on the NOAA Ship Gordon Gunter in March 2006 and February 2007 to collect ichthyoplankton samples from the western Caribbean. In addition a joint shore based sampling effort has been carried out since 2004. Shipboard samples were collected from the MOCNESS, neuston net, juvenile fish trawl and inshore samples were collected with channel nets and light traps. Sorting and identifying these larvae will provide the first broad map of the larval fish distributions and inshore recruitment from the Yucatan Channel south along the peninsula, and north into the Gulf of Mexico. All samples will be identified using standard taxonomic procedures described in the &lsquo;Identification guide for the western central North Atlantic' (Richards, 2006) Fish larvae will be identified to the lowest possible taxa and data sheets provided for each sample.</p>

<p>ECOSUR is a partner in this coral reef proposal and in the permits granted to the SEFSC by the Government of Mexico. Under the conditions of the permitting they have intellectual rights to this information and the samples must remain in Mexico at ECOSUR. ECOSUR is uniquely situated as the only major research center in the vicinity of the field sites Bahia Ascension and Xcalak, on the border of Mexico-Belize. The researchers involved in this project are specialists in their field and are uniquely suited to lead this research project M. Sc. Lourdes Vasquez-Yeomans, since 1987 has been working on taxonomic and ecological aspects of coastal ichthyoplankton in the Mexican Caribbean; she has produced several papers and developed a large collection of larval fish together with a database. Currently, she is conducting larval sampling in key nursery areas of the southern Mexican Caribbean. To acquire the services from another source could result in loss of data, inconsistency in gathering and analyzing data both of which could compromise the entire program.</p>

3.  SCOPE:    The Naval Air Warfare Center  Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement for a Fuel Measurement System (FMS) using a single sensor Gravimetric Method  to measure fuel consumption rates and fuel density on a wide variety of small prototype internal combustion engines, during performance and endurance testing in an Altitude Environmental Chamber (AEC), over a wide range of temperatures and altitude conditions.  The engines are being evaluated for use in unmanned aerial vehicles and will be evaluated with dynamometer and propeller loads.  The AEC is located in the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), Patuxent River, MD.  The Navy is seeking a solution using commercial off the shelf and/or non-developmental components that can be modified by the contractor and integrated into a single complete measurement system to meet the Navys detailed requirements given below. 

4.  REQUIREMENTS:  

1.0   CLIN 0001 - A quantity of one (1) Fuel Measurement System shall meet the following requirements:

1.1  The FMS shall use a single sensor gravimetric method to measure, in a steady and continuous fashion, the steady state net fuel consumption rate for the engine under test in a measurement time interval of 10 seconds or less.  The FMS fuel consumption measurement range shall be at least 0.1 to 7 lb/hr with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable, end-to-end accuracy of +/- 2% of reading or better below 2 lb/hr AND +/- 0.5% of reading or better at 2 lb/hr and above.  The FMS shall also provide fuel density measurement in units of pounds per gal( lb/gl) with a minimum measurement range of 4 to 10 lb/gal with NIST traceable, end-to-end accuracy of +/- 0.5% of reading accuracy.  The FMS shall operate with diesel fuel #2 over a minimum fuel temperature range of 35F to 160F and with aviation fuels JP5, JP8, and aviation gas over a minimum fuel temperature range of -30F to 160F.

1.2   The FMS shall operate with engines under test in the AEC under the following AEC conditions: -50F to 160F temperatures, chamber atmosphere pressures from ambient (nominal 14.7 psia) down to 5.5 psia, relative humidity from 5% to 100% with condensation, up to 10 mph airflow, and airflow pulsations generated during engine driven propeller operation.

1.3   The FMS shall have a built-in reservoir of at least 1 gallon from which it supplies and maintains the fuel to the engine at fuel flow rates from 0 to 47 lb/hr at the AEC test condition temperature. The FMS shall take in return fuel flow from the engine at fuel flow rates from 0 to 47 lb/hr and condition the fuel temperature as required. The FMS shall, under all AEC test conditions, prevent the fuel temperature supplied to the engine from falling below a user adjustable temperature  in the range of -30F to 50F.   The FMS shall maintain the back pressure within the supply and return lines within -1.5 to 1.5 psig (relative to AEC chamber atmosphere pressure).  The FMS shall operate with typical diesel fuel injection and carbureted fuel systems which are gravity fed or employ a fuel pump and be immune to the pressure pulsations generated by such systems. The FMS shall operate with return line fuel flows of 0 to 6 times the net engine fuel consumption rate.

1.4   The FMS shall have the following features: standalone and wall-mount capability; a built-in display for fuel measurement and density; 4-20ma analog outputs for fuel consumption rate and density for customer connection to a data acquisition system; fuel filter with replaceable elements; constructed of corrosion resistant materials; provide built-in fault detection of conditions that cause significant degradation of measurement accuracy; accessible for routine maintenance, calibration, and measurement sensor removal; and configured to allow gravity draining of all fuel from the unit. The FMS shall have a  built-in reservoir with the capability to be remotely refillable via connection to a Navy customer supplied day tank; and remote indication of fuel level status of the built-in reservoir via analog output.

1.5   The FMS components mounted inside the AEC shall fit inside the following maximum overall space envelope: 32 width x 12 deep x 96 height with up to 54 of the height dimension above the engine centerline; for any components required to be mounted outside the AEC, space envelope is 48 wide x 48 deep x 96 tall.

1.6   The FMS shall have NIST traceable calibration and shall be factory tested at the following nominal conditions:  0.1, 2.5, and 7 lb/hr -50F, room temperature, and 160F with test results supplied with the FMS.

CLIN 0002 - Calibration Kit  Quantity 1 EA

(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Executive Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation, or CNCS) was created by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service to their communities.  Through its three main programs - AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, and the National Senior Service Corps - the Corporation provides a broad range of opportunities for Americans to serve their communities and ultimately, the nation's challenges in the areas of education, public safety, human needs and the environment.

The Office of the National Service Trust (the Trust) issues educational awards to individuals who successfully complete a term of service in an AmeriCorps program and makes payments on their behalf.  The Trust is responsible for processing thousands of documents each year associated with the disbursement of payments to financial and educational institutions.  The volume of these documents has increased substantially each year with the enrollment of additional AmeriCorps members in the Trust and the increase in the number of disbursements each year.  

In order to better manage the delivery of paper documents, improve processing time and ultimately improve customer service, the Corporation seeks a quality contractor to provide first class mailing services.

Scope of Work:

The contractor shall provide first class mailing services.  The contractor shall print, insert, sort, and transport the pieces to the post office and mail those items by first class mail.  The contractor shall provide all materials, unless the Corporation stipulates otherwise [the Trust orders some envelopes], and shall pay for postage.  The contractor shall work with the Corporation to establish these mailing routines.  

Deliverables:
The successful contractor shall provide monthly reports to the requirements office on the volume and disposition of the mail processed and mail rejected due to erroneous addresses.  

Below are descriptions of these documents and an estimate of the number processed each year:

The documents to be processed and mailed on behalf of the Trust are:

1.	Voucher Package at the time of Award
2.	Voucher Package following Payment
3.	Vouchers on request
4. 	Form 1099-MISC
5.	VISTA W-2
6.	Special mailings

Voucher Package at the time of Award is mailed to AmeriCorps members when the award is granted. This page document provides the current account statement and various letters for future payments. Approximately 14,700 of these documents are mailed annually (58,800 Sheets).

Voucher Package following a Payment is sent to AmeriCorps members when some account activity, such as a payment or refund, occurs.  This four page document provides the current account statement and forms for future payments, if any balance remains.  A zero award balance creates a one-page document (approx. 50%).  An account statement occasionally generates an extra page due to the frequency of payments.  Approximately 11,500 of these documents are mailed annually (up to 28,750 sheets).

Vouchers on Request: Voucher packages are mailed to members on request (approx. 5 pages).  Approximately 5,000 are received annually. (25,000 sheets)

Form 1099-MISC is a federal tax form. This two page document includes a letter containing tax information. Approximately 50,000 of these forms are mailed annually (46150 sheets in January 2008).


Form W-2 is a federal tax form mailed to VISTA members at the beginning of each calendar year. This is a one page document. Approximately 12,000 forms are mailed annually.

Special mailings: the Corporation may authorize a special mailing as needed, its composition to be determined at that time.

The contractor shall have an electronic based system that is capable of retrieving, recording and mailing a large volume of documents; that is capable and flexible enough to manage various types of documents and forms; that has the ability to provide monthly statistical production reports and information on rejected mail; and that can perform a comprehensive zip code edit.  Documents with faulty addresses shall not be mailed out, and shall be returned to the Trust.

The Operating Environment - Hardware/Software

The Corporation currently operates in a mixed network environment. The Headquarters network is almost entirely Windows NT. Microsoft office XP is the standard office automation software used as the desktop operating system and Windows NT as the network operating system. The Trust uses an Oracle database system and Microsoft Windows NT. Electronic files are transferred weekly or as needed.  The Contractors hardware and software must be compatible with the Corporation's computer environment.  The contractor must work with the Corporation's Office of Information Technology (OIT) to create the required configurations for transmittals.

The Corporation for National & Community Service recommends that all quotations be sent via overnight carrier, hand carried to the Corporation, or sent electronically.

All wire rope cable and chain above silt-level shall be removed from the water and disposed of off site. At the Contractors discretion, they will be allowed the alternative of pulling the entire offshore anchor system out and removed off site.<BR><BR>Task 2:<BR><BR>i.  SHORTEN FIRST SPAN OF WIRE ROPE CABLE  This work includes shortening the first span of 2-inch diameter wire rope cable at the dam face connection. Approximately 10 to 20 feet of wire rope shall be removed. The trash shear boom shall have 6 degrees of sag, as indicated in the For Information Only drawings. The Contractor shall clean the end of the wire rope cable before re-installing the spelter socket. Zinc shall be used to fasten the spelter socket. It may be required to remove the first trash shear boom float and the gap debris float to allow enough slack to facilitate the socket potting process. Follow spelter socket manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning spelter socket and installing wire rope cable. The connection shall be able to develop the full capacity of the wire rope cable. The first trash shear boom float is currently temporarily tied off with synthetic (poly) rope to the dam face connection. The Contractor shall field verify the cut point on the main line to keep the first trash shear boom float in the same longitudinal position (measured from the face of the dam upstream to the first float) after reassembly. After realigning and installing the 2-inch wire rope cable, the Contractor shall move the connection on the first float for the debris rubber curtain upstream to remove excess slack. The Contractor shall leave enough slack to allow the debris float to move without binding up.<BR><BR>ii.  REMOVE EXISTING AND INSTALL NEW BACK STRAP  This work includes removing the existing back strap wire rope cable, replacing it with new, and moving its dam face connection point to an existing pad eye and shackle on the dam approximately 10 feet south from the original tie back location.

Neoprene insulation shall be 5 inches wide.<BR><BR>Task 3 Option 1:<BR><BR>FURNISH AND INSTALL 4 INSHORE ANCHORS ON INTERMEDIATE ANCHOR FLOATS  If directed by the Government, this work includes replacing 4 inshore/downstream anchors systems. The anchor system includes hardware, wire rope cable, chains, and lifting cable from the intermediate floats to the anchor, as well as the anchor. These items shall be replaced with like kind. The anchors may be refurbished and of equal or greater size, but shall not be smaller than indicated on the contract drawings. The existing lifting buoys shall be reused. This task also includes installing a new 10-foot length of lifting chain and new lifting buoy on the intermediate float end of the anchor chain to assist in future locates. Existing anchor and lifting buoy wire rope cable and chain shall be pulled taut to remove all slack and cut at the location where the chain goes into the silt. All wire rope cable and chain above silt-level shall be removed from the water and disposed of off site. At the Contractors discretion, they will be allowed the alternative of pulling the entire offshore anchor system out and removed off site. Two intermediate floats are tied off to the south shore with synthetic rope. The Contractor shall remove the existing synthetic rope.<BR><BR>Task 3 Option 2:<BR><BR>FURNISH AND INSTALL INSHORE ANCHOR HARDWARE ON INTERMEDIATE ANCHOR FLOAT S - If directed by the Government, this work includes replacing the existing inshore/downstream anchor cable and associated hardware connections with new synthetic (poly) rope and hardware connections to existing shore anchors. The Contractor shall field verify the length and install the rope. Existing inshore anchor and lifting buoy wire rope cables and chains shall be pulled taut to remove all slack and cut at the location where the chain goes into the silt. All wire rope cable and chain above silt-level shall be removed from the water and disposed of off site. On each new poly rope connection, the Contractor shall install a new 20-foot length of slack chain to the poly rope. Additionally, the Contractor shall replace the wire rope cable and hardware from the intermediate float connecting eyes to the tow plate with like kind on the intermediate floats inshore side. The Contractor shall add a new lifting buoy on the bottom end of the tow plate to allow access to the wire rope cable connection to the intermediate floats from above. At the Contractors discretion, they will be allowed the alternative of pulling the entire offshore anchor system out and removed off site.<BR><BR>Task 4:<BR><BR>i.  RE-INSTALL CHAIN FROM TRASH SHEAR BOOM FLOATS TO THE 2-INCH MAIN LINE (OPTIONAL) - If directed by the Government, this work includes re-installing chains running from the trash boom floats to the 2-inch main line that have extra shackles in the assembly. For each chain, the Contractor shall remove the upper locking plate, lengthen the chain, remove the extra shackles, and re-assemble. There are three (3) known assemblies that require work, all within the first span. They are located on Float 2 upstream chain, Float 4 downstream chain, and Float 5 downstream chain. It is possible that up to 15 float chains will require reinstallation. The Contractor shall begin at the dam face and move upstream, replacing the chains as needed, until they either 1) re-install 15 chains or 2) reach the end of the trash shear boom structure.<BR><BR>ii.  INSPECT BOAT ACCESS AND REPLACE WIRE ROPE CABLES (OPTIONAL)  If directed by the Government, this work includes inspection of the boat access and replacement of the wire rope cables from the frame to the floats. The Contractor shall inspect the entire steel frame and the two (2) floats, looking for signs of corrosion and damage to steel parts. The Contractor shall also inspect the 2-inch diameter wire rope cable ends and connectors to the steel frame, looking for signs of corrosion, section loss, or damage to the wire rope cables and sockets. Additionally, the Contractor shall inspect the wood 2 x 6's to see if any are missing and to ensure all fasteners are secure. The Contractor shall provide a report and dive video (in DVD format).<BR><BR>iii.  INSPECT 2-INCH MAIN LINE ON ENTIRE TRASH SHEAR BOOM (OPTIONAL)  If directed by the Government, this work includes inspection of the 2-inch main line (wire rope cable) along the entire length of the trash shear boom. The Contractor shall look for missing shackles, loose pins, missing cotter pins or fasteners, corrosion, wear, and/or damage on all connection points between the trash boom floats and 2-inch main line wire rope cable. Any cotter pins or fasteners discovered missing shall be replaced with Government-furnished property (GFP) during the inspection. The GFP property will be large-diameter stainless steel welding rod that shall be used in place of the cotter pins and it shall be bent after installation. It is anticipated that 15 cotter pins will require replacement at miscellaneous points along the entire length of the boom.  The Contractor shall provide a report and dive video (in DVD format).<BR><BR>GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS<BR><BR>i.  GALVANIZED COATINGS - Zinc coatings shall be applied in a manner and of a thickness and quality conforming to ASTM A 123/A 123M. Where zinc coatings are destroyed by cutting, welding, grinding, or other causes, the affected areas shall be regalvanized. Coatings shall be regalvanized to the thickness and quality specified for the original zinc coating. Coatings shall be repaired with a suitable low-melting zinc base alloy in accordance with ASTM A 780. The use of zinc-rich paint will not <BR>be allowed.<BR><BR>ii.  WIRE ROPE - Wire rope shall be size as shown, extra improved plow steel (EIPS), right regular lay (RRL), and galvanized. Wire rope shall be pre-stretched in accordance with FS RR-W-410 by subjecting it to three (3) cycles at 40 percent of its nominal strength. The 40 percent loads shall be held for five (5) minutes with 5 percent loads and shall have a 5 minute delay between cycles.<BR><BR>iii.  AS-BUILT DRAWINGS  As-built drawings shall be required for the trash shear boom, specifically the main 2inch diameter wire rope cable length between spans, anchor weights, and anchor GPS locations.<BR><BR>iv.  SYNTHETIC ROPE - Shall be 1-1/4inch diameter, 12-strand synthetic rope, AlliedSignal Spectra Fiber, Puget Sound Rope Plasma 12 Strand, or approved equal, with the following salient features:<BR><BR>Minimum Tensile Strength: 165,000 lbs (Breaking Strength)<BR>Specific Gravity: 0.98<BR>Melting Point: 248 degrees F<BR>Critical Temperature: 150 degrees F<BR>Elongation at Break: 4 to 5 percent<BR>Fiber Water Absorption: 0 percent<BR><BR>Both ends of the line shall have a rope thimble fitting. Thimble shall be rated at the rope strength.<BR><BR>v.  ANCHORS  Offshore/upstream anchors shall be positioned 15 degrees from right angles to the trash shear boom line. An anchor shall be set 5 to 10 feet (or whatever distance experience dictates) further out than the designated anchor point, and along the anchor cable line. The anchors shall then be dragged downstream at right angles to the trash shear boom line; their final positions to develop maximum holding power. After the offshore anchors are set, a minimum 10-ton load shall be gradually applied by a surface vessel or from the shore to test the holding capacity of each anchor. Inshore/downstream anchor chain and cable lengths are approximate and actual lengths may have to be adjusted in the field depending on the actual distance to the shore anchors to develop maximum anchor holding resistance. However, no intermediate anchor shall be closer to the boom than the horizontal distance, minus the 10-foot plus or minus allowance. Offshore anchors shall, in addition, stay within the 20-foot adjusting chain length.<BR> <BR>DRAWING LIST:<BR><BR>FILE NUMBER	SHEET NUMBER	    TITLE<BR>	G-001	COVER SHEET AND LOCATION MAPS<BR>	G-002	INDEX TO DRAWINGS<BR>	S-001	GENERAL PLAN<BR>	S-501	DETAILS<BR>	S-901	PHOTO SHEET 1 -

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION/AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO SOLICITATION NO. DTFH61-08-Q-00080.  THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION IS HEREBY EXTENDING THIS SOLICITATION FROM THURSDAY, AUGUST 28, 2008 TO FRIDAY, AUGUST 29, 2008 @ 3:00 PM EST.  

ADDITIONALLY, HERE ARE QUESTIONS AND THE CLARIFICATIONS BEING PROVIDED.

Section IV.1  Please clarify, is the pricing to be provided per the table included on page 6 under Payment Provisions, or a detailed cost breakdown as noted in Instructions?  If the pricing is firm-fixed price, why is the cost breakdown being asked for? As stated in the Request for Quote, a firm fixed price shall be provided for each task for the base and option years.  The breakdown of the total cost is requested to see how the offerors derived at their firm fixed price.

SOW.Contractor Pricing and Payment Provision  How will the invoicing and payment components of this contract work?  If the contract is for 100 assessments per year, shouldnt the pricing reflect a per assessment cost for Tasks 4-5 rather than a firm-fixed for the 100?  Proposals are to be based on a fixed price based on 100 assessments.  Offerors shall also include the cost per assessment. 

SOW.Delineation of Contractor Tasks.A  For planning purposes, how many assessments per month are you anticipating asking for?  Will these be approved by Task Orders?  The government is anticipating awarding a firm fixed price purchase order for the base period not a task order.   It is anticipated that the assessment will be announced and conducted to the identified 100 within a specific period of time and completed within a specified period.

SOW.Delineation of Contractor Tasks.B  Are you requiring that the entire assessment only be 50 questions, or just the open-ended question section?  With 28 competencies, the assessment will probably require 100+ questions to adequately measure the responses on each competency. It is anticipated that the assessment will consist of no more than 100 questions with a desired number of questions to be closer to 50.

SOW.Estimated level of effort  Task 5 is not represented on this list.  Was this an oversight?  Task 5 will be included in the estimated level of effort  No estimate available at this time.

SOW.Estimated level of effort  How many times do you see tasks 1, 4 and 5 being repeated across a year? Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4 are completed once annually.  Task 5 requires reports and graphical representations as requested on collected data be define and available to be processed as requested. This also includes ad hoc reporting on all fields.

SOW.Work Location  The SOW indicates that some work may take place at the contractors facility, where will the rest of the work take place?  Are all 100 participants going to be at one location, for example, Washington, DC? Any onsite work will be in Washington HQ.  The participants will be across the country in every state.   Assessments will be completed in HQ and all other work to be completed at the contractors facility?.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED IN THIS PROCUREMENT.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a One-Dimensional Universal Length Measuring Machine (ULM) to be used by the Engineering Metrology Group at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

Background
The Engineering Metrology Group provides measurement services in the area of dimensional metrology for customer artifacts from 0.1 mm up to 1000 mm in length.  Our current universal length measuring machine is a SIP 550 and has been retrofitted with a laser interferometer because the inherent scale accuracy of the instrument as procured was not sufficient for the measurements required.  The system still uses the original control board and computer system for all motor controlled movements of the instrument and the electronic measurement force setting control.  In the instruments current state, instrument can not be serviced but can be completely refurbished.   The major concern is that failure of the instruments controller and/or PC could mean that several standard measurement services would be indefinitely halted.  After researching the upgrade/refurbishment of the current SIP 550 system with Heidenhains best linear scale revealed that the structure and design of the instrument will not support the desired performance.  The ultimate goal was to improve the machines scale accuracy, thus making the laser interferometer system available for other applications and changing the scale measurement to one that was less sensitive to environmental fluctuations (i.e., atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure (relative humidity)).  

This is a BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agencys needs.***


***All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):  

Line Item 0001:  Quantity One (1) Each, One-Dimensional Universal Length Measuring Machine (ULM) with a minimum of 500 mm length measuring capacity


Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

The instrument shall provide PC controlled movement: in the measure direction, z-axis support table movement, and electronic measurement force setting/control.  The instrument shall be capable of measuring inside and outside lengths and diameters and the major diameter and pitch diameter of straight and tapered thread gages.  The support stage of the instrument shall minimally provide manual adjustments for part rotation, part translation front to back (y-direction), and part tilt in the XZ plane.

<DESC>Amendment-002:  The NCI - Office of Acquisition has received additional questions regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Please see below.


Question 2.	Is there a protocol for this study?
Answer2.    Yes 

Question 3.	Is there ethical approval for the study? If yes where? NCI and Ghana (university of Ghana)
Answer3.   IRB approval 

Question 4.  Will the protocol be submitted for ethical approval in Ghana? 
Answer 4.   Yes. Already done.  

Question 5.	Will there be an Informed Consent process? 
Answer 5.    Yes 

Question 6.	Is this study ongoing in Korle Bu? 
Answer 6.    Yes 

Question 7.	If the study is ongoing are they still recruiting and collecting samples at Korle Bu?
Answer 7.    They will be as soon as we let this contract. 

Question 8.	If (7)above is yes then is this solicitation seeking  a contractor to manage those activities; or it is seeking a contractor who will be recruiting and collecting samples independently along side the ongoing study. 

Answer 8.    The earlier study was completed. This is an expansion of the earlier study, so we are seeking a contractor to do the work as we specified in SOW.  We are seeking a contractor who can recruit cases and collect blood and separate them. This is similar to what we did before. 


Comment:  I am asking these questions because if the solicitation is for a contractor who will be recruiting patients, collecting samples from patients including pathology slides of their prostate; then there should be ethical approval. 

Answer:  Yes, we have this from both NCI and Ghana.  

Comment:  We will have to submit the protocol and Informed Consent Form to an IRB in Ghana for approval before we can recruit any patient.  

Answer:  Yes, this is done. 

Comment: Because this is research that involves a) Human Participants; 2) Invasive procedures on patients, 3) involve shipping biological samples and 4) Genetic investigation.   We need to know what the plans are with regards to ethical approval or seeking approval and factor this into our proposed scope of work.  

Answer:  All done.  




Amendment-001: The NCI - Office of Acquisition has received questions regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Please see below.

QUESTION: I wanted to understand a specific component of the scope of work in NCI solicitation number  RFQNCI80108NG01  Ghana Prostate Study.  Specifically the tasks for the study include a step Conduct interviews using the forms provided by NCI. 

It is labeled as a medical abstraction form  a summary of each case that is part of the study.  

Answer:  Both in-person interview and medical record abstraction will be conducted, using the forms developed by NCI.  

QUESTION:  I would like to understand NCIs approach to data collection involving interviews/surveys in support of clinical research.  In this project the survey instrument is previously developed.  While that makes for effective controls on cross study data comparison, there are site specific factors that may require modification to the survey. 
The questionnaire has been developed and used in part of the study, so there will be no changes to this tool. 

I didnt understand the scope of work to include what done with the survey data once it is collected  the specimens yes, but not the survey data.  Is there someone in the program office that I could speak with to understand how the data is entered into a case system for analysis and if that is part of the scope of this project or if that is work performed in Bethesda? 

Answer:  The data will be entered in Ghana twice (for accuracy) and then transferred to NCI.  Statistical analysis will be carried out at NCI.

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION NCNA2400-8-40884 - QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
<p>Below are Qs and A's pertaining to the solicitation. They are in no particular order. Numbering is redundant. No additional questions will be entertained.</p>
<p>Reference: Combined synopsis/solicitation.<br />Text: Entire passage<br />1. Question: Expected Award date is not provided. Please help us understand your expectations.</p>
<p>Award is expected by September 20, 2008.</p>
<p>Reference: 5.3 Professional Implementation Services<br />Text: Entire section<br />2.Question: It is not clear how pricing of professional implementation services will be evenly evaluated for all responders. Is the vendor to estimate hours and labor categories over the planning period ? Or will all vendors be evaluated against the same number of hours ?</p>
<p>The vendor should estimate the hours to implement the customized system over the planning period and price it.</p>
<p>Multiple References: Paragraph 1 Background: "The system will initially support 15 concurrent service desk analysts supporting approximately 100 customers. It is anticipated that the system will grow to support approximately 20 distinct service desks, 100 service desk analysts, and 2200 end-user customers."<br />Paragraph 4.2 System Requirements: "System must support up to 60 simultaneous agents and while supporting 2,500 end-users (120 simultaneously)."<br />Paragraph 5.1.2 Client Licenses: "The contractor will provide user licenses to support:<br />&bull; Fifteen (15) concurrent-use service-desk analysts<br />&bull; Five (5) Service Level Managers<br />&bull; Unlimited number of end-user self-service/self-help customers"<br />3.Question: From the above references, a multitude of configuration scenarios and assumptions may be presented to National Ocean Service. So that vendors are evaluated evenly, please clarify the minimum requirements so that the software licensing estimates are appropriately matched.</p>
<p>The initial implementation must support 15 concurrent-use service desk analysts, 5 service level managers, and up to 2200 end-users. The implementation must be sized to support the potential addition of 85 service desk analysts operating out of 20 distinct service desks supporting a grand total of 2200 end-users.</p>
<p>Reference: 5.2.2 Technical Support<br />Text: The first bullet; "24x7x365 telephone emergency problem resolution." <br />4. Question: How long is the contractor expected to provide technical support? Is the vendor to be evaluated on 90 day support requirements, one year support requirements, or other time frame?</p>
<p>The vendor is expected to provide one year of technical support along with maintenance.</p>
<p>Will the agency require 5.2.2 support to be performed onsite ?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Can we assume that the technical support will begin after the implementation phase and will be extended for one year?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Reference: Combined synopsis/solicitation.<br />Text: Entire passage<br />5.Question: Expected contract duration is not referenced. Please define.</p>
<p>Vendor is expected to provide professional services to implement the software per stated requirements. Vendor is expected to provide one year of maintenance and technical support.<br />Future service is not assured</p>
<p>Reference: 5.2.2 Technical Support<br />Text: 24x7x365 telephone emergency problem resolution. <br />6.Question: Software support via email, telephone, and through the internet is included with the software maintenance. Are there support requirements beyond what is typically provided through software maintenance? If so, please clarify any additional requirements.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>1. Is this RFQ going to result in a procurement this FY, i.e.-by end of September 2008? Yes. <br />2. Are there any current management tools (such as network fault mgmt or enterprise systems management tools) that need to be integrated into the ITSM solution? In addition to Active Directory, NOS would like to integrate Microsoft Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) 2007, Systems Center Operations Manager 2007 (SCOM), and RightAnswers Knowledge management solutions. <br />3. Is the desire of this procurement to procure a software change management tool as an integrated piece of the ITSM solution or is there an existing software change management tool currently implemented that would need to be integrated? If the latter, please name said technology. Yes. NOS would like to have an Change Management solution as an integrated piece of the ITSM solution. <br />4. Are there any other software packages/technologies that we need to integrate with in support of NOS enterprise services such as desktop services and security services? Not at this time. <br />5. The SOO indicates that the ITSM solution needs to support a single sign on capability. Is that with respect to the ITSM solution itself or does that imply that there are currently NOS applications that require an integrated single sign on capability? The proposed ITSM solution should integrate with an existing Active Directory domain allowing single sign-on with AD credentials. <br />6. Is this project directed towards software vendors only, or can small consulting firms bid the work whom have a working relationship with an appropriate vendor? No. Small consulting firms can bid the work as long as they can demonstrate that they can satisfy the requirements. <br />7. 2. Can I use subcontractors under my company to help me complete the implementation? Yes.<br />8. 3. Will NOS have an assigned technical team to assist in the software implementation? NOS will have an assigned technical team to assist in the implementation. <br />9. 4. Can you confirm that the schedule is for the software to be implemented and complete within 90 days? Does this include applicable training? The expectation is that the software will be implemented within 90 days. This includes applicable training. <br />10. Are you leaning toward a particular product? (Looks like BMC Remedy... please confirm)<br />11. We have evaluated a number of products. We are asking vendors to propose a solution that satisfies our stated requirements. <br />12. 2. What system are you currently using? What version?<br />13. We do not currently have an ITSM system implemented in NOS. <br />14. 3. In addition to the standard out of the functionality, what integrations and customizations are you expecting in the first 90 days?<br />15. We expect to integrate with Active Directory, Systems Center Configuration Manager, Systems Center Operations Manager, and RightAnswers.<br />16. 4. What are the integrations points and what systems are going to give a onetime feed?<br />17. To be determined. We would like to limit the number of one-time feeds. <br />18. 5. How many CI's are you managing from SMS?<br />19. Currently approximately 2600 computers and 50 applications. <br />20. 6.Is SMS the only tool used for CI's or will there be others?<br />21. Currently SCCM -- there may be others as we evaluate solutions for managing non-Windows systems and applications.<br />22. 7. Is there going to be a reconciliation process included with the integration points for CI's?<br />23. If necessary</p>
<p>24. 8. Are we connecting to a people database such as Peoplesoft for dynamic updates?<br />25. No<br />26. 9. Is all your data cleaned and ready for importing into the system? If you think it is ready, what system did you get it from and is it aligned with ITIL processes? Please describe.<br />27. No<br />28. 10. Are we creating reports as part of the project or just showing your team how to get the data?<br />29. It is anticipated that the contractor will provide sufficient training so that NOS personnel can create reports and retrieve the data themselves. <br />30. 11. What type of federated data is expected to be integrated within the tool?<br />31. TBD<br />32. 12. How many people and in what roles will NOAA assign to the project to work with the contractor?<br />33. NOS has a team of 4 who will be working with the contractor in various capacities (technical, oversight, engineering). <br />34. In the Notice on FBO it states that the system will grow to 2200 end user but in the Statement of Objectives it says must be able to support up to 2500 end users. Which number should we base our technical requirements from. Please use 2200 end users. Sorry for the confusion.<br />35. 2. The requirement also asks for the ability for 60 simultaneous agents to be on at the same time. Is that broken down into Tiers of support (Tier 1- Call Center, Tier 2 -System Administrators, Tier 3- Developers or SME) and how many of the 60 are dedicated Tier 1 support needing access all the time. The requirement does not distinguish between Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 agents simultaneously access the system. Please assume an appropriate mix of 60 call center, SAs, Engineers accessing simultaneously. <br />36. 3. In section 5.1.2 it asks for 5 Service Level Managers to have access how many are going to actively 100% of the time on the application verses intermittent logging on the application. All Service Level Managers will use the system intermittently. <br />37. 4. Section 4.3.8 Knowledge Management also talks about the integration with existing Right Answers product. Is it fair to assume the Right answers is already operational in production and the product and development will be already established prior to the ITSM integration or will new development have to be included in our proposal. Also are we trying to use the ITSM (Remedy) Knowledge Management functions or will it be either (Right Answers or the BMC Knowledge Management product if selected) . It is fair to assume that RightAnswers is already operational.<br />38. 5. What reporting tool in section 4.3.1.1 will be used in conjunction with the selected product (Business Objects, Crystal, Reportal) If reporting is not a core component of the ITSM solution, the vendor should propose an appropriate tool. <br />39. 6. Is the planned testing period for all users and user training on the 75th Day Yes <br />40. 7. How many users on the 90th Day will be using the system via web/client tool At initial implementation: 100 end-users and 15 agents. <br />41. 8. How will the customer handle delays not in the Vendor control that may occur. Customer will work with the vendor to adjust the schedule appropriately to accommodate government-caused delays outside of the control of the vendor. <br />42. 9. Will there be any preferences given to businesses with set-asides standards of (Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or any ) even though this is an open small business requirement. The requirement is a small business set-aside.<br /><br />43. What Service Desk utility is NOAA National Ocean Service (NOS) currently running? Please provide version #. NOS is currently running a few different service desk applications: Heat, Track-It, and home-grown. <br />44. Does NOS expect infrastructure architecture and pricing for HW and HW licensing to be included as part of this bid? Or will NOS provide the necessary HW infrastructure for a development/test and production ITSM system environments? NOS will provide the necessary H/W infrastructure for the development and production ITSM system environments -- bids should not include H/W pricing or H/W and operating system licensing costs. <br />45. Would NOS provide copies of its existing processes identified in Section 4.3, which would be the basis for our solution? Processes referred to in section 4.3 are still under development and revision. <br />46. Are these processes compliant with and map to the ITIL V2 or V3 framework? If so would you be able to provide a matrix mapping them? Processes will be ITIL v3 compliant.<br />47. What are the personnel security requirements for this RFP? U.S. Citizen and or public trust?No specific personnel security requirements.<br />48. No where in the document does it identify whether pricing is CPFF or T&amp;M with allowable ODC's. Please provide clarification. The RFQ states that the award will be fixed price <br />49. RFQ page 3, Section 4.2. Please provide further definition of minimal. Doe sit mean minimal HW footprint, minimal management, or both?Minimal H/W footprint. <br />50. Will this system be deployed in a virtual server environment? If so, which Virtualization toolset will be used?System will not be deployed in a virtual server environment initially. Proposed solution should support running in a virtual environment for potential deployment in the future. <br />51. What components of RightAnswers does NOS currently use?Self-service, Support Analyst, and Solution Manager. <br />52. Does NOS require formal training to be provided at NOAA facilities in Silver Spring, MD, Washington, DC metro area, or first commercially available training in the U.S.?No specific training-venue requirements have been identified. Vendors should propose a training solution that will be evaluated along with all other factors to determine best value to the government. <br />53. Would NOS evaluate Software as a Service (SaaS) solution for ITSM equally with a locally installed and run ITSM solution? NOS is not considering Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions at this time as it has determined that these solutions introduce significant IT Security concerns with regard to Certification and Accreditation of systems outside the boundary of our security systems and third-party access to government data. <br />54. Has NOAA NOSS engaged a ITSM consultant to develop ITSM process or modify existing processes to be complaint with ITIL v2 or v3 guidance? Specific to the processes identified in Section 4.3 of the RFQ? If not has NOAA NOS included this level of effort in it basis of estimate for the project cost and duration? Yes, NOS has engaged an ITIL/ITSM consultant.</p>

<a href="mailto:velvet.taylor@us.army.mil">Aviation Applied Technology Directorate</a>
<DESC>This amendment modifies Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911W6-07-R-0003 as follows:  (1) revises the descripton for Topic 02-2008: Advanced Aircrew Protection; (2) revises Anticipated Funding and Performance Period to update anticipated funding for FY10 and clarifies desired performance periods; (3) clarifies Security guidance for offerors responding to Topic 01-2008; (4) clarifies/identifies additional infomation to be included in the cost proposal; and (5) revises anticipated contract award and abstract and proposal submission dates for award cycles 2 and 3.  All previous guidance remains unchanged unless revised via previously posted Amendment.<BR><BR>1. TOPIC 02-2008: Advanced Aircrew Protection <BR>U.S. Army Aviation accident data shows that approximately 90 percent of helicopter impact type accidents are survivable. As a result, many helicopters have been upgraded with crash protection features such as energy absorbing crashworthy crew and troop seats; high energy absorbing landing gears; improved occupant restraint systems; and supplemental restraint systems including cockpit air bag systems. However, as mission gross weights have grown and aircraft velocities have increased, the effectiveness of the features intended to prevent occupant fatalities and minimize the number and severity of occupant injuries in a crash has decreased.  Advanced Aircrew Protection will address the subsystems constituents of crashworthiness, to include innovative and advanced energy absorbing concepts/technologies and devices, and active crash energy sensing and management concepts/technologies to provide optimum crash protection to occupants of current and future aircraft in varying aircraft, aircrew and crash impact conditions. Based on Cycle 1 awards, an integrated active crash protection system approach with an open system architecture is currently being investigated with an external air bag system as the initial active crash protection subsystem demonstrator.   An active restraint/headrest subsystem is also being explored under a Cycle 1 award which has a potential for integration into the active crash protection system.  Under award Cycles 2 and 3, additional innovative and advanced crashworthiness technologies for aircrew and troop protection, which will reduce fatalities and minimize injuries, are sought.   If innovative and advanced energy absorbing technologies and concepts are proposed for aircrew or troop seats, it is important to address improved ergonomic design features/technologies, which must function in synergy with the crash energy attenuation design concepts/technologies to improve crew endurance and performance during extended missions while providing increased survivability in crashes. As crashworthiness from a subsystems perspective is largely a crash energy management problem, efforts in this area are expected to yield at least a 25% increase in crash energy attenuation over current systems. The advanced aircrew protection concepts and technologies to reduce occupant fatalities, minimize injuries, and improve crew endurance and performance must be developed with minimum adverse impact on weight, cost, space, power, and in-flight performance.<BR><BR>2. TOPIC 01-2008: Conventional Threat Protection - Approximately $5.7M ($1M FY08, $1.05M FY09, $1.64M FY 10, and $2.1M FY11). <BR>TOPIC 02-2008: Advanced Aircrew Protection - Approximately $5.7M ($1M FY08, $1.05M FY09, $1.64M FY 10, and $2.1M FY11).<BR>FY 08-09 funding specified for Topics 01 and 02 has been obligated under Cycle 1 awards, and therefore, is no longer available.<BR><BR>Except for Cycle 3, which shall have a period of performance of approximately 11 months or less, it is desired that proposals include a period of performance of 12-24 months.  Offerors shall insure that the period of performance will be completed by September 30, 2011. <BR><BR>3.  Offerors responding to Topic 01-2008 must have a facility clearance, storage capability and personnel cleared to perform at the Secret level.  Evidence of facility clearance, storage capability and personnel cleared to perform at the Secret level shall be provided with proposal submission.<BR><BR>4.  The Security Clearance Information (specified in the Security Requirements Section) and the Subcontracting Plan (specified in the Subcontracting Plan Section) shall be included in the cost proposal (if applicable).<BR><BR>5.  Anticipated contract award dates for the three cycles are as follows: March 2008; October 2009; and  October 2010.  To be considered for the first quarter FY 10 award, the abstract cut-off date is May 20, 2009 and the proposal cut-off date is not later than 1:00 p.m. August 14, 2009.  To be considered for the first quarter FY 11award, the abstract cut-off date is May 20, 2010 and the proposal cut-off date is not later than 1:00 p.m. local time, July 13, 2010.  Proposals received after the due dates indicated above will be held and evaluated in the subsequent evaluation cycle only if the proposal includes a validity date which has not expired. Any proposal received after the final cut-off date of July 13, 2010, will be handled in accordance with FAR 52.215-1, Instructions to Offerors - Competitive Acquisition.<BR>

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-APO-1), Jemal Building, 11th Floor, 1900 Half Street, S.W, Washington, DC 20590 Telephone (202) 475-3754 Fax: (202) 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 03 Sep, 2008, 3:00 p.m., EST.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency.  Anticipated award date is on or about 14 SEP 30, 2008. Contact Danny Sawyer at Danny.R.Sawyer@uscg.mil or 252-335-6561 for questions regarding this solicitation.

FOB; Destination, -Accountable Property Officer, Building 5464, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway Utah, 84022,<BR><BR>(APR 2004) (a) This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103. An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed. A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA. (b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract. (4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). (1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay override. (2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies. (3) The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program. Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice. The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action. (d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. (e) For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority. (f) An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest. (g) Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) .

The hardware solution was analyzed and tested for inter-operability with existing Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be both the best technical solution and value. All testing was based on predetermined Department requirements.  Wholesale changes in equipment type will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthy retesting, configuration, and design.  The department will also not realize a return on investment in this product which will lead to a non standardized environment for a solution that requires cross platform consistency.Additionally, changes in design will place unnecessary risk to the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to the lengthy process of placing new equipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterprise use.IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as the only suitable items available in the market today meeting the Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in the backup model described in paragraph two (2).Furthermore, the equipment is listed on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts.Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems.  Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements.As this is a Brand Name (Limited Source) only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking systems.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Individuals involved in the venture capitalist (VC) community are invited to apply for two-year appointments as consultants for the Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative (DeVenCI). Applicants should be experienced with emerging information technologies. Experience in other defense related emerging technologies, such as energy, biotechnology, materials/nanotechnology, or space, is also desirable.

DeVenCI is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) activity that seeks to improve national security in the Global War on Terrorism. Its dual goals are to speed DoD adoption of promising new commercial technologies and to encourage broader commercial support of the DoD supply chain. DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

VCs selected to participate will serve as unpaid consultants and are expected to provide the DoD with their unique expertise in the areas of evaluating leading-edge technologies, understanding the dynamics and risks of small and emerging-technology businesses, and identification of DoD relevant technology area experts.

Interested VCs can find additional information at http://DeVenCI.dtic.mil/. Applications for two year terms from December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2010 will be accepted until midnight, 30 September 2008.

<DESC>Response to Questions - Amendment #31.	Will this contract be mandatory or strongly recommended?This will be mandatory use.  2.	Did/does VIP currently have a toner BPA?There is one in existence in VISN 223.	If you are awarding on lowest price, will you have multiple awards?No.4.	We thought E-way was a proprietary website of Corporate Express?  Will our offer be in jeopardy because we do not utilize Corporate Express' E-way?The term "E-way" was mistakenly used as a generic online ordering method.  Bidders are encouraged to have an online ordering method; however, it is not a requirement and will not affect the award outcome.

<DESC>The US Agency for International Development Mission to Colombia (USAID/Colombia) awarded Contract No. 514-C-00-08-00312-00 to Democracy International Inc to conduct an independent evaluation of its human rights program.
The evaluation is to assess the progress of the USAIDs Human Rights Program (HRP) and to offer recommendations to increase the impact and effectiveness of the program. The program is implemented by Management Sciences for Development, in partnership with various civil society organizations, the Government of Colombia (GOC),1 and Colombian state institutions (State Entities) tasked with independent oversight responsibility for human rights, including the Inspector General (IGO  Procuradura) and the National Ombudsmans Office (Defensora del Pueblo).
The primary audience for this assessment is USAID/Colombias Democracy and Governance (DG) Office and USAID/Colombias Front Office. The results of this evaluation will assist USAID to determine if adjustments to the program should be made and whether the final two option years of the MSD contract should be exercised.
