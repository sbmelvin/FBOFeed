<p>Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Missile Sustainment Division (AFNWC/NDM), is pursuing the award of an "Other Transaction" Agreement (OTA) for EMLAs. Other Transactions (OT's) are codified in 10 U.S.C. 2371b (section 2371b), and offer a streamlined method for carrying out prototype projects and transitioning successes into follow-on production.<br /><br />This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes only and neither constitutes a solicitation nor a commitment by the government to award an agreement now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be compensated. The Government does not intend to award an agreement on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information in this RFI. Your response will be treated as information only, it shall not be used as a proposal.<br /><br />The government is requesting information from industry in regards to the EMLA (P/N 2022210). The EMLA is a critical mechanical component used on the Air Launched Cruised Missile (ALCM). There are two EMLAs installed in each air vehicle, and their primary function is to control the elevons on the ALCM. The purpose of this OT is to remanufacture the EMLA to meet Government needs and extend the service life of the ALCM to a minimum of 10 years.<br /><br />The Government wishes to invite any companies who are interested in participating in an OTA for prototyping, to include qualification testing and potential follow-on production of an EMLA, to fill out and return the attached OTA Questionnaire.<br /><br />Interested vendors should submit their responses no later than 22 October 2018 by Noon, Central Time to all AFNWC/PZNT POCs listed on the attached OTA Questionnaire.</p>

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.
