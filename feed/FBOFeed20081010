<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final Draft Version of Statement of Work</p>
<p>A. Project Identification &amp; Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to support clinical research in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB). The contractor(s) shall conduct all phases (screening, enrollment, treatment, and follow-up) of clinical trials in patients with TB disease and, if applicable, latent TB infection, including observation, treatment, data collection and follow-up after therapy. The scope of activities will range from conducting small laboratory-based studies to large Phase 2 and long-term Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate new TB drugs, diagnostics, and treatment regimens. The contractor(s) shall also participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium (TBTC). A description of the TBTC and a copy of the TBTC By-Laws are provided as Attachments in Section J. <br /><br />B. Background and Need</p>
<p>The resurgence of tuberculosis from 1986-1992 in the United States served to remind the nation of the continuing threat posed by this disease. In response, national plans for TB control and elimination were developed. These included the "Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Tuberculosis," adopted by the Advisory Council on the Elimination of Tuberculosis, the "National Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis," and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Report "Ending Neglect." All call for the development of new drugs and drug delivery systems for the treatment of tuberculosis and tuberculosis infection, and for the evaluation of different combinations and intervals of administration of new and existing drugs. <br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has historically placed a high priority on the field evaluation of new drugs and drug regimens, new delivery systems, and new diagnostic tests in multicenter trials, to determine their effectiveness under program conditions. The clinical trial evaluation of new treatments for TB must be conducted in different areas of the world to ensure that adequate numbers of patients are studied and to assure applicability of findings among diverse racial and ethnic populations affected with TB. Discovery of findings applicable to management of TB disease in children, in pregnant woman and in persons living with HIV/AIDS are also goals of the TBTC. Recognizing that a network of investigators with access to large numbers of patients with tuberculosis or tuberculous infection is necessary for the rapid and timely implementation of investigative protocols, CDC's Division of TB Elimination (DTBE) funded and established the TB Trials Consortium (TBTC). <br />The current TBTC is a group of &gt;25 clinical study sites (health departments and academic medical centers) that are funded by CDC via individual contracts, or through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Washington D.C., to perform studies of TB treatment. The TBTC also conducts studies of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug-drug interactions involving anti-TB drugs. Examples of past and current TBTC protocols (including Study 29 and Study 29 PK, the TBTC's newest studies), are included as Attachments in Section J.</p>
<p>C. Statement of Work</p>
<p>CDC and the current TBTC investigators have together developed an infrastructure and methods of operation that fully engage the capacities of the clinical sites. The current infrastructure of the TBTC includes:<br />&bull; a network of clinical sites in the US, Canada, Brazil, Uganda, South Africa and Spain. The North American sites are health departments or academic medical centers under contract with CDC, or are funded via the Memorandum of Understanding mechanism administered by the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Washington DC. The study sites in Brazil, Uganda, South Africa and Spain are funded through subcontracts that have been established by academic medical centers in North America on behalf of, and with funding from, the CDC;</p>
<p>&bull; a formal set of By-Laws which govern the function of the consortium, and which define a <br />network of committees, protocol teams and working groups to facilitate the accomplishment of the consortium's objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; a communications system of e-mail, telephone conferences, web-conferences, online transfer of data, and semi-annual in-person meetings;</p>
<p>&bull; cooperative relationships with local TB control programs at each site, which facilitate the recruitment and management of trial patients;</p>
<p>&bull; an expert Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board which convenes approximately annually to review ongoing clinical trials;</p>
<p>&bull; coordination with and between the CDC IRB (ethical review committee) and IRB's from the clinical sites;</p>
<p>&bull; a Data and Coordinating Center at CDC. The DTBE-CDC functions as the Data and Coordinating Center (DCC) for the TBTC. A DTBE-CDC project officer is designated for each clinical study. The DTBE-CDC Project Officer, the designated DTBE-CDC contractor, and the study statisticians have access to all data collected for TBTC studies, and review data as recorded on the case report forms or in the central database;</p>
<p>&bull; Web-based 24/7 enrollment capacity, and a continuous, real-time data quality assurance program;</p>
<p>&bull; cooperative relationships with key manufacturers of TB and anti-HIV drugs, and with key public-private partnerships, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies;</p>
<p>&bull; cooperative relationships with mycobacteriology, pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and genetics laboratories within CDC and worldwide;</p>
<p>&bull; cooperative relationships with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. National Institutes of Health;</p>
<p>&bull; an expert contract research organization (CRO) which performs clinical site monitoring and provides a variety of other support functions;</p>
<p>&bull; collaborative relationships with a variety of relevant global experts in TB clinical trials, medical statistics, pharmacology, animal modeling, basic mycobacteriologic science, and other domains.</p>
<p>As noted above, several executive committees-composed of site investigators, study coordinators, and DTBE-CDC staff-conduct the administrative and development work of the TBTC. These committees include:<br />I. the Core Science Group (CSG), which develops and oversees implementation of the TBTC's scientific research agenda; <br />II. the Implementation and Quality Committee (IQC), which supervises the conduct and quality assurance of ongoing studies, and assures the feasibility of proposed new studies;<br />III. the Publications and Presentations Committee (P&amp;P), which directs the manner in which results of TBTC studies are made public;<br />IV. the Advocacy and External Relations Committee (AER), which manages TBTC's relationships with outside institutions and entities; and,<br />V. the Executive Affairs Group (EAG), which is composed of TBTC leadership (including chairs of other major committees) and which serves as the executive arm of TBTC. <br />The TBTC By-Laws codify this committee structure.</p>
<p>C.1 Contract Requirements<br />Each contractor shall, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the Government, furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to concurrently perform multiple studies and/or clinical trials for the treatment of active and/or latent tuberculosis (TB) and for the evaluation of new tests or approaches for the diagnosis of TB infection and disease, using procedures outlined in each study's applicable protocol. At the study sites, data must be available for external checking against the original source documentation as required by U.S. federal regulations. Either DTBE-CDC staff or an external Clinical Site Monitoring Contractor will evaluate good clinical practice, data collection and reporting, regulatory compliance, accurate protocol implementation, internal quality management, and test product accountability. Site visits will be performed approximately twice a year, or as needed to review selected protocols, provide training on protocol conduct, review internal quality assurance plans, and document error resolution.</p>
<p>The expected duration of these contracts is ten (10) years. During the next decade, the focus of the consortium will initially be on therapy of active TB disease. Studies involving latent TB infection (LTBI) may be undertaken at future times if judged of sufficiently high priority and recommended by CSG, approved by the TBTC Steering Committee, and supported by DTBE.</p>
<p>Specific contract requirements include the following:</p>
<p>a. Participation in clinical research studies each year. The contractor shall:<br />1. Recruit, screen, consent, enroll, treat, and follow patients for TB studies. The patient population shall reflect the demographics of the local community, and shall include minorities and women. Expected enrollment is based upon WHO reported or estimated incidence. The contractor, if based in an area of low TB incidence (&lt;20 cases per 100,000), shall enroll a minimum of 10 newly diagnosed active tuberculosis patients each year over all actively enrolling TB treatment protocols. Contractors based in areas of medium TB incidence (21-100 cases per 100,000) shall enroll a minimum of 30-50 newly diagnosed active tuberculosis patients each year over all actively enrolling TB treatment protocols. Contractors based in areas of high TB incidence (&gt;100 cases per 100,000) shall enroll a minimum of 100 newly diagnosed active tuberculosis patients each year over all actively enrolling TB treatment protocols.</p>
<p>2. Retain, and follow to completion of study, patients enrolled in TB trials and studies.</p>
<p>3. Conduct research studies and/or clinical trials in accordance with each study's applicable protocol. In general, these studies will follow the procedures detailed in each protocol with regard to scheduled clinic visits, required laboratory tests (performed in qualified laboratories), required chest x-rays, and appropriate data collection forms to be used for reporting results. When required by individual protocols, the contractor shall be responsible for shipping of specimens to designated laboratories or repositories.</p>
<p>4. Conduct and report on studies according to accepted Good Clinical Practice and in compliance with existing U.S. Federal Regulations (including CDC, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the Office of Human Research Protections [OHRP]) and applicable national policies concerning use of investigational agents and protection of human subjects. Because these studies will be funded by the U.S. government, they must comply with regulatory requirements of both the host country and the United States.</p>
<p>5. Report adverse experiences of patients in clinical trials according to specific protocols, and in compliance with applicable national and U.S. regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>6. Collect and report data according to the requirements of the specific protocol. Each site shall provide copies of completed patient data forms to the CDC Project Officer by a mutually agreed mechanism, and at intervals determined by the protocol (within 30 days of event unless otherwise specified).</p>
<p>7. Respond to data queries and requests from the Data &amp; Coordinating Center at CDC.</p>
<p>8. Participate in as many active TBTC protocols as is feasible at the site, considering availability of TB patients and staff capacity.</p>
<p>9. Assure laboratory capacity and performance required by study protocols;</p>
<p>10. Send required administrative reports to DTBE-CDC by a mutually agreed upon mechanism and schedule;</p>
<p>b. Full participation as a member of the TB Trials Consortium (TBTC) <br />Throughout the duration of the contract, the contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium (TBTC), as specified in the TBTC By-Laws (provided as an Attachment in Section J). The contractor shall abide by these By-Laws. In particular, as an active member of the TBTC, the contractor shall:<br />1. as a responsible member of the Steering Committee, participate in efforts to develop, implement, monitor, and update the TBTC research agenda;</p>
<p>2. adhere to the policies, procedures, and By-Laws that guide all aspects of the TBTC's activities, and operations;</p>
<p>3. participate as appropriate in protocol development;.</p>
<p>4. participate actively and as appropriate in TBTC committee activities;</p>

<p>7. abide by the TBTC policies and procedures for the publication of data included in the TBTC By-Laws;</p>
<p>8. participate in TBTC conference phone calls and e-mail communications, and attend two TBTC meetings per year;</p>
<p>9. accept and abide by any Conflict of Interest policy included in the TBTC By- Laws; and,</p>
<p>10. interact with local TB and HIV Control Programs to integrate and complement their respective work and research agendas.</p>
<p>C. Special considerations for clinical study sites located outside of the U.S. and Canada</p>
<p>Offerors whose proposal includes the enrollment of patients who reside outside of the United States or Canada can propose to become a TBTC site in one of three ways:</p>
<p>Option (1) - the offeror may be a U.S. or Canadian institution that proposes to sub-contract with institutions outside of these two countries on behalf of the U.S. government (CDC), with the purpose of conducting clinical trials for treatment or prevention of TB. In this instance, the offeror's proposal will include a subcontractual arrangement with an institution outside of the U.S. and Canada. The international, sub-contracted institution would be chosen to provide access to a larger population of potential trial participants (persons with TB disease or infection) than would be available at the institution of the primary offeror. This arrangement will provide for close coordination between the two institutions. <br /><br />Under Option 1, the US/Canadian institution will provide: <br />-expertise in clinical trials, in Good Clinical Practice, in Good Laboratory Practice, and in human subjects protections, and<br />- experience in the management of research contracts with U.S. government agencies (such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), experience in compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to clinical trials, and experience in sub-contracting procedures.</p>
<p>Under Option 1, the international institution will provide: <br />- access to a large population of TB patients,<br />- expertise in the implementation of research in their own national setting, and <br />- the large majority of the skilled staff necessary to implement the trials. <br />Such arrangements serve typically to build or strengthen capacity in both of the partners.</p>
<p>Option (2) - the offeror may be a non-U.S., non-Canadian institution eligible to receive funds (and institute research activities) directly from (and for) a U.S. government agency. In this instance, the offeror should submit a proposal that is inclusive of all required elements, and the contract would be executed directly and solely with the non-U.S., non-Canadian institution. Non-U.S., non-Canadian ("international") offerors opting for this approach are expected to be institutions with substantial and well-documented experience in the conduct of clinical trials, significant experience in tuberculosis research, significant prior successful experience in receiving and responding to clinical research funding, and experienced administrative staff familiar with U.S. government contracting procedures.</p>
<p>Option (3) - the offeror may be a qualified international institution which elects to obtain supporting services and expertise from a U.S. or Canadian institution through the mechanism of a subcontract. As in option #2 above, the offeror must be a non-U.S., non-Canadian institution eligible to receive funds (and institute research activities) directly from (and for) a U.S. government agency. And as in option #2 above, in this approach, the international institution/offeror is expected to demonstrate (i) substantial and well-documented experience in the conduct of clinical trials, (ii) significant experience in tuberculosis research, (iii) significant prior successful experience in receiving and responding to U.S. clinical research funding, and (iv) the availability of experienced administrative staff familiar with U.S. government contracting procedures. The difference from Option #2 is that in this approach, the offeror proposes to obtain some portion of items i-iv through a subcontract with an institution that can provide or strengthen any of these elements. An offeror applying under option #3 must be fully qualified to accomplish administrative aspects of the contract and sub-contract, and should be of sufficient technical strength that it could reasonably be expected to manage its own technical support services.</p>
<p>In each of these 3 approaches, the offeror (with its subcontractors, if any) should demonstrate (a) the availability of patients to enroll, (b) the availability of significant technical strengths in the implementation of TB clinical trials, and (c) the availability of all necessary administrative and regulatory expertise to fulfill the requirements and objectives of this contract.</p>
<p>C.2 Contract Phases<br />This contract will be performed in 10 annual phases of 12 months each as follows:</p>
<p>PHASE 1: <br />The contractor shall perform start-up/preparation activities in accordance with the procedures and guidelines outlined in detail in the enclosed example of a Phase 2 clinical trial, a Phase 3 clinical trial, and/or a pharmacokinetic protocol. Examples of protocols for TBTC Studies are provided as Attachments in Section J. Enrollment into a study may not begin until the relevant ethical committees or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have granted approval (it is recognized that new sites often require somewhat longer time periods to obtain ethical/IRB approvals for the first studies undertaken as part of a new activity). <br />The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above. This will include, during this and all subsequent phases, attendance at semi-annual investigators' meetings. The purpose of these meetings is to review progress and implementation of current trials, to learn from outside experts, and to discuss possible new studies. These meetings will be held twice a year, one in Atlanta GA near CDC in October or November, and one in May in an external location (which may be the site of the annual American Thoracic Society Conference, or may be a different U.S. or foreign site).</p>
<p>PHASE 2: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for the studies chosen to be implemented in Phase 1. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 3: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 4: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 5: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 6: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 7: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 8: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 9: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>
<p>PHASE 10: <br />The contractor shall start or continue the enrollment, treatment, follow-up, observation, data collection, and data analysis of patients for new studies or for the studies that remain active from previous phases. The Government estimates that 0-4 new studies may be initiated during this phase. The contractor shall participate fully as a member of the TB Trials Consortium as described above.</p>

<DESC>DARPA is developing broad and diverse technologies necessary for external sensing deep inside buildings with the objective of providing a  suite of sensing technologies for situational awareness both above- and below-ground suitable across a broad range of building environments.  The component technologies must support all external ISR concepts of operations ranging from pre-mission planning through detailed assessment of targeted structures, and live updates during mission execution. 

The intent of this solicitation, DARPA-BAA-09-08, Harnessing Infrastructure for Building Reconnaissance, is to investigate individual technological approaches that leverage building infrastructure to opportunistically collect information for interior awareness. DARPA believes that opportunistic sensing may be exploited to infer urban interior building awareness using exterior observations. Specifically, DARPA asserts that: 

	The geometry and stimulus response of building infrastructure contains tactically useful information on the interior structure.  Infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, the structural, electrical, plumbing, and ventilation systems. 

	Such information may be acquired through access to the exterior of buildings which may include direct contact with an exterior umbilical, but does not require contact or deployments within the building. 

	Approaches to acquiring such information may require active as well as passive sensing.

	Multiple approaches may be required to provide complete building interior awareness. 

	A mission is expected to depend upon an optimal mix of technologies determined by the specific environment.  

DARPA is soliciting proposals to investigate and validate individual Sensing Technology concepts.  For purposes of this BAA, a Sensing Technology refers to an end-to-end process consisting of the signature of interest (related to a HIBR User Objective), the transducer technology (i.e., the coupling into the building infrastructure), the transmission path to the building exterior, the capture and interpretation of the signature, and the interface that displays the information to the user.  
SEE ATTACHED FILE FOR FULL BAA DESCRIPTION.

In accordance with the attached draft Statement of Work, the FAA requires assistance with the acquisition and management of that aviation insurance liability coverage.  
Required tasks include:	Support and advice for the provision of aviation liability insurance, and the management of an insurance program in conjunction with the FAA Contract Tower Program.
	Recommendations for the selection of insurance underwriters, and determining adequate insurance coverage together with rationale and justification to the FAA.
	Coordination between selected insurers and the FAA.
	Claims management service between the FAA and insurers.
	Regular status reports regarding current aviation liability insurance market conditions.
	Recommendations for improvement of the aviation liability insurance program to the FAA.

Identify your firm's business classification, i.e. large, small, small disadvantaged, woman owned or small service disabled veteran owned (NAICS Code 524298).
The FAA will not use the capabilities statements to screen or down select.  Rather, they will be used to determine the range of vendor interest, experience and capability.  This is not a request for offers, nor is it the Government's intention to use this as a screening device for any such future requests.  However, the Government may invite respondents for follow up discussions.

<DESC>The Dark energy Camera (DECam) requires a Shutter with a clear aperture of 600 mm. This is larger than any astronomical Shutter that has been built to date. At the same time, the accuracy and reproducibility of the Shutter Mechanism employed is crucial to the success of the Project. To minimize vibrations, the Shutter shall be impact-free. This can be achieved by a slit-type Shutter with low acceleration light weight blades driven by computer controlled stepper motors. In order to achieve the required photometric precision absolute timing accuracy of better than 10 ms has to be guaranteed at any point across the aperture. Requirements on Shutter exposure time accuracy and repeatability are 50 ms and 5 ms, respectively. The Dark Energy Camera will be installed on the Blanco 4 m telescope at CTIO in Chile and thus all components have to be able to withstand the harsh mountain environment. The Shutter performance has to be maintained from -5 Degrees C to +20 Degrees C and from 0 to 100% relative humidity.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), China Lake intends to enter into negotiations for a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) contract on an other than full an open competition basis to General Electric (GE) Aviation Digital Systems.  The government requires GE to develop a replacement Radar Display Computer (RDC) to replace the existing RDC for the AV-8B aircraft. The replacement RDC shall: 1) fit in the same location and meet the same environmental conditions as the legacy RDC. 2) The SRAs shall have the same form factor, pin out and I/O connectors excepting those changes necessary for enhanced capability. 3) The microprocessor shall be a PowerPC product. 4)The RDC shall include dual redundant power supplies and backup HUD driving capability.  5) The Contractor shall reuse as much of the current legacy RDC design as practical, economical, and feasible. 6) The replacement RDC design shall be backward compatible with the current Radar AV-8B configuration.   7)The Contractor shall update J2, J3, and J5 connector to support: Twenty-four (24) additional discrete inputs, and Two (2) additional video inputs; 8) The RDC shall provide at least two (2) spare card slots for future growth.

Delivery of the contract line items (CLINs) will be FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD), CA 2 years after award.   This requirement is limited to GE for the following reason:  Smiths Industries, LLC was the original developer of the RDC for AV-8B II+.  Smiths also provided all of the engineering support for software updates through out the life of the AV-8B including the Day Attack and Night Attack configurations.  Recently, GE purchased Smiths Industries, LLC in total.  Therefore, all of the engineering knowledge and expertise related to the AV-8B II+ RDC resides at GE Aviation Digital Systems.   This includes specific and unique assembly language that will need to be converted, and experience metting the restrictive and extreme physical environment inside the Harrier Avionics bay.  Any firm believing that they can provide the above listed RDC's, clearly showing their ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data, while achieving the compatibility issues stated above, may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 15 December 2007.

This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your requestfor source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with youroffer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for sourceapproval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The project applies to Hickam AFB and occasionally to other USAF installations on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. This project will be procured on an unrestricted basis. Basis of award will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical evaluation factors. A competitive best-value source selection will be conducted in which the competing offerors' past performance history, and response to the Technical Evaluation criteria, when combined, will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost/price considerations. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the offer is deemed to provide the overall best-value to the Government. The NAICS code is 237310. The work is required in support of Base Civil Engineer activities. The contract will include a wide variety of paving tasks as listed in the Unit Price List, which will be further priced with the Contractor's coefficient. During the contract period, the Base Civil Engineer will identify each specific project and the Base Contracting Office will issue individual delivery orders to the Contractor to complete those projects. The contractor will be required to furnish all plant, labor, materials, equipment, and appliances; and performance of all operations, complete in strict accordance with the specifications, subsequent delivery orders, drawings, and subject to the terms and conditions of the contract, and incidental related work. The total performance period for the contract will be 12-months for the basic contract period and four 12-month option periods. The total duration of the contract will be 60-months. The total guaranteed minimum amount of $5,000.00 would apply only to the basic contract period. The maximum annual contract amount over the lifetime of the contract will be estimated at $25,000,000.00. There is a $5,000 minimum delivery order limitation; the maximum delivery order limitation is a total of $500,000.00 for a single item, and any combination of items in excess of $1,000,000.00 in any year of the contract. It is anticipated that the solicitation for this project will be issued electronically on or about 12 Mar 2009 on the Government's Electronic Posting System (EPS) at www.fbo.gov. You must register on that site in order to receive notification of changes to the solicitation. The Government will not provide copies of the solicitation, specifications, drawings, etc. Requests for solicitations by telephone or e-mail will not be honored. All prospective eligible Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for a contract award. Registration requires applicants to have a DUNS number from Dunn &amp; Bradstreet. Recommend registering immediately in order to be eligible for timely award. The Pre-Proposal Conference and closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Government in its ultimate acquisition approach, and nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.

Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>U. S. GOVERNMENT SEEKS EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
 IN CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA

Requirement:  

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 9,895 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 8,604 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for ten years.  The space must be available for occupancy by July 1, 2009.  The delineated area is within the city limits of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

- 5 reserved spaces for official Government vehicles
- Public transportation within 1 mile of the premises

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost/benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  Please send expressions of interest no later then November 28, 2008, to:

<DESC>The New York District intends to solicit and award a dredging project of Jamaica Bay Entrance Channel, New York under Solicitation No. W912DS-09-B-0003.  This project requires the dredging, possible transportation, and placement of approximately 333,000 cubic yards of material, with placement at the Historic Area Remediation Site (HARS).  The contractor will be required to maintain a production rate of 4,000 cubic yards per calendar day and complete work within the required time frame of December 2008 through March 2009.  In the past, this maintenance dredging operation required beach placement; therefore, it was performed with a hopper or cutterhead dredge.  Based on the selection of the HARS as the disposal site, it is expected that a hopper or clamshell dredge will be used.  There are no small business contractors in the New York area, or in a reasonable mobilization distance, that owns a large hydraulic or clamshell dredge.  Informal market research indicates no new firms with the required equipment present in the Northeast.  The apparent low bidder shall be officially notified by the contracting officer to submit the following information: a) name, location, point of contact, b) evidence of the daily production capability and the output rates of at least 4,000 cubic yards per day for their proposed integrated system of dredging and placement. In addition, a synopsis (narrative detailing the operation to move the dredged material from the dredging site to its final resting place) of the proposed operation is also to be submitted by the apparent low bidder. Bidders should consult with Section 00800 paragraph 1A.1 of the Specifications for detail submittal requirement. The Apparent low Bidder shall, within 15 calendar days from the date the Apparent low bidder is notified of being the low bidder, provide copies of all required permits and approvals for transfer, transportation, dewatering and/or other processing (if any), and final disposal of dredged material, and shall submit evidence of such permits and approval. The Contractor will be required to commence work within five (5) calendar days after the date of receipt by him the notice to proceed, to prosecute said work diligently and to complete the basic work (216,845 CY) ready for use not later than sixty four (64) calendar days after the receipt of the notice to proceed. Optional work (5 options) totaling 115,785 cubic yards of material, if exercised, will be performed by allowing a rate of one (1) calendar day for each 4,000 cubic yards removed.  The contractor is required to maintain an integrated production of at least 4,000 cubic yards per day. It is anticipated that dredging/placement would take place within the approximately time period of 15 December 2008 to 31 March 2009. The work is estimated to cost between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 24 October 2008 with bid opening on/about November 24, 2008. It is the intention of the Government to award and issue NTP by the first week of December 2008 with dredging to follow immediately. Liquidated Damages will be $1571.00 per calendar day of delay until all work under the contract are accepted. This is an UNRESTRICTED Procurement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, Dredging. The business size standard is $18,500,000. The SIC CODE is 1629, which is Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. Large business concerns must submit as part of their bid a subcontracting plan for this project in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-8 and FAR Clause 52-219-9. Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the Offeror ineligible for award of the contract. The small business subcontracting goals for this procurement are 70% of the total subcontracting dollar value. Of that 8.8%should be placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 6.2% with Women Owned Small Businesses, 7% with HUBZone Small Businesses, 9.8% with Veteran Owned Small Businesses and 3% with Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.

If capacity remains available at the expiration of any contract performance period and the Government determines it to be in its best interest to exercise the next contract option period, the unused capacity will be rolled forward for use in the subsequent contract performance period. The annual rates for the then-current contract period will become effective for both the unused capacity of the previous period and the current annual capacity.

The estimated base and option year contract capacity is $2M each period.  Contract options may be exercised early if the contract capacity is utilized before the contract performance period expires.  However, the contract rates do not increase until the annual period for which they were negotiated has elapsed.  If capacity remains available at the expiration of any contract performance period and the Government determines it to be in its best interest to exercise the next contract option period, the unused capacity will be rolled forward for use in the subsequent contract performance period.  The annual rates for the then-current contract period will become effective for both the unused capacity of the previous period and the current annual capacity.  The annual contract rates are fixed prices for the annual period for which they are negotiated and shall not be adjusted as a result of the early exercise of contract options or when unused capacity is rolled forward to subsequent option years.  The contract minimum guarantee of $10,000 may be obligated via issuance of an initial task order concurrent with award of the IDC.  The IDC is anticipated to be awarded in February of 2009.

The metal outer package lid is then placed on the successfully sealed package and closed to manufacturer specification meeting transportation requirements. </span></p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a market search for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement.
The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide the Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC) with support for its research efforts in the detection and decontamination of chemical, biological, or radiological (CBR) contamination that may be intentionally introduced into drinking water distribution systems, ambient (indoor and outdoor) air, building and other surfaces.  In particular, EPA is seeking sources that can establish and implement a mechanism for testing, evaluating, and reporting on the performance of homeland security related technologies for addressing CBR warfare agents.
Specific homeland security related technologies include the following: (1) Decontamination/surface cleaning (indoor and outdoor surfaces) of large buildings, structures, and other surfaces; (2) Analytical techniques for continuous measurement of fumigant chemicals; (3) Decontamination of drinking water distribution systems and wastewater treatment plants; (4) Water quality monitoring and detection; (5) Ambient air quality monitoring and detection; (6) Air cleaning methodologies for use in buildings and other structures; (7) CBR sampling methods - including water, air, soil, and from surfaces; (8) Point-of-use and point-of-entry drinking water treatment technologies; (9) Treatment of wastewater generated during decontamination; (10) Computer software programs for use in designing water system or building monitoring networks; (11) Personal protective equipment.
The contractor shall expect that pilot scale testing will be required for testing of sample cases.  Full-scale, large-item testing may be required for a more realistic evaluation of technologies using certain CBR agents, surrogates, or both.  It may also be necessary to conduct testing using real chemical and biological warfare agents; therefore, the contractor shall have the capabilities, expertise, and a Biosafety Level 3 facility for handling pathogenic organisms.  The contractor must also have an active chemical surety laboratory and a bailment agreement with the U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM).
Specific areas to be addressed in capability packages submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) Capabilities to test, evaluate, and report on the performance of the homeland security related technologies, enumerated above; (2) Availability of a Biosafety Level 3 facility for handling pathogenic organisms; (3) An active chemical surety laboratory; (4) An active bailment agreement with RDECOM.
The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Statement of Work (SOW).  A draft SOW can be obtained for the OAM website, http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd/.  Any interested firms should submit capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including facilities, personnel, experience and qualifications.  Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis. 
It is anticipated that the contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) Level of Effort (LOE) with five one-year periods, each with LOE of approximately 35,000 hours.  The applicable NAICS code is 541712 (research and development in the physical, engineering, and life sciences [except biotechnology] with a size standard of 500 persons. In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS code, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hub zone, 8(a), women-owned, small-disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern.  
As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel (FAR 52.219-14). The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above should be submitted to growney.matthew@epa.gov no later than 25 calendar days from the date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER KINDS OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.<BR> <BR>1.  SUBJECT:  The Air Force Medical Evaluation Support Activity (AFMESA) is conducting market research on software systems for Operating Room Management (ORM).  Responses are due to this Request For Information (RFI) by 4:00 PM on 10 November 2008.<BR>2.  DISCLAIMER: This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kind of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future Request For Proposal (RFP), as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under any future operating room management initiative, will not be entertained.<BR>3. BACKGROUND: The Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) has identified a need for an AFMS ORM.  That need has been manifest in a lack of reliable, usable data to support evidence-based operational decision-making and surgical care optimization.  Operating Room (OR) staff must be able to schedule, track, and report vital management statistics in a timely, business-like, cost-efficient manner.  Specifically, OR staff must be able to produce accurate and timely reports that meet mandated clinical and Air Force headquarters reporting requirements and provide management with the information needed to ensure efficient utilization of all resources. <BR>The purpose of this AFMS ORM solution is to provide an automated system capable of surgical scheduling/reporting and has interoperability with other automated medical support systems that include Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS), AHLTA, Essentris, Defense Medical Human Resources System - internet (DMHRSi), and Composite Health Care System (CHCS).<BR>4.  REQUIREMENTS: The AFMS ORM solution will provide a cost-effective, role based ORM solution that will automate and streamline the scheduling of personnel, equipment, facility space, and materials used in approximately 12 AFMS medical treatment facilities (MTFs). The ORM solution will provide decision-makers with tools and information necessary to make mission-critical and financially feasible decisions.  The AFMS does not view the ORM solution as the system-of-systems for the Military Health System (MHS), but rather envisions it as a solution to bridge the functionality gap until other MHS programs are fully developed, deployed, and implemented.  Upon achievement of a mature MHS system, the data from the AFMS ORM family-of-systems would be transferred or integrated into the fully implemented MHS system-of-systems suite.  <BR>4A. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS: The following are the top-level requirements for the AFMS ORM system.<BR>1.	The AFMS ORM system will provide automated surgical scheduling and include status board capability. <BR>2.	The system will be interoperable with MHS software systems that will support the OR Mgmt solution.  For example,  DMLSS, CHCS, Essentris, DMHRSi,,the capability to track provider credentials, and patient billing. <BR>3.	The system must be able to support pre-, intra-, and post-operative data input and retrieval.<BR>4.	The system will provide inventory management of consumables and equipment (supplies, equipments, implants, instruments) down to the line item level. <BR>5.	The system will have the capability to conduct resource management activities related to people, facility, and vendors.<BR>6.	The system will be capable of generating user defined and ad hoc analysis reports.<BR>7.	The system will be capable of populating user defined forms.<BR>8.	The system support must include initial and follow-on training along with appropriate training materials.<BR>9.	The system support must include a helpdesk support function.<BR>10.	The system shall be Net Ready and compliant with requirements levied by the Defense Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP), Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other sensitive data protections levied by the Privacy Act, Department of Defense, USAF, and AFMS directives.<BR>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about commercially available products that meet or can be readily modified to meet the requirements discussed above.<BR>5.  CONTACT INFORMATION: Response to this RFI must be addressed to Jim Sylvester, Contracting Officer Technical Representative, via e-mail at james.sylvester@detrick.af.mil. Response must be received by this office on or before 4:00 PM local time on November 10, 2008. This request for information is not a commercial solicitation and the Government will not pay for any information submitted, or for any costs associated with providing the information. POINT OF CONTACT: AFMSA/SGRTE, James Sylvester, Contracting Officer Technical Representative, (301) 619-8624, FAX (301) 619-8638, james.sylvester@detrick.af.mil. <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION to gain knowledge of potential capable firms to compete for awards under the anticipated multiple award solicitation. 

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) Acquisition Directorate (CG-9) is seeking potential sources in support of Program Management, Acquisition, and Administrative Support Services for the Acquisition Directorate its respective Major Systems Program/Project Offices.   

An analysis of the Acquisition Directorates procurement of professional major systems support services concluded that a more strategic or enterprise-wide approach could be employed to obtain comprehensive professional major systems acquisition support services in support of CG-9 Acquisition Directorate in order to limit the impacts of diminishing resources across the Acquisition Directorate.  

CG-9 has developed three (3) separate Draft Performance Work Statements (PWSs) in the enterprise domain areas of 1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology expertise; 2. Business Management, Studies and Analysis, and Cost; and 3. Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration Professional support services.  All services to be provided are non-IT.

The conceptual acquisition strategy is to establish separate multiple award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract domains consisting of a basic ordering period of one (1) year and four 1-year optional ordering periods for each enterprise domain area.  Task orders will be competed strictly within the context of each enterprise domain area multiple awards ID/IQ contract.  

The potential program ceiling (over 5 years) for all enterprise domain areas is $20,000 to $650,000,000 and potentially as follows: 1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology - $20,000  $450,000,000,  2. Business Management, Studies and Analysis, and Cost -  $20,000  $100,000,000; and 3. Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration Professional support services - - $20,000  $100,000,000.  The estimated program ceiling reflects the total value of all actions to be conducted under that multiple award enterprise domain ID/IQ contract area.

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.

The purpose of this Request for Information is to seek capability statements from interested small businesses in order to affirm market research of the possibility of setting aside any or all three (3) of these enterprise domain ID/IQ contracts for performance by Small Businesses.

Any SMALL BUSINESS FIRM, including Small Disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB-Zone, Service-Disabled-Veteran-Owned, or Woman-Owned, intending to propose as a PRIME CONTRACTOR (including those planning to use the affiliation and  teaming rules issued by the SBA) are invited to submit a capability statement to the Government.  Large business requests for capability statement opportunities as a prime contractor are not desired or required at this time.  

While each of the enterprise domain draft Performance Work Statements are separate and distinct from the others, the Acquisition Directorate is only issuing a single Request For Information/Sources Sought Notice.  Contractors may respond to more than one of the enterprise domain areas; however, they must submit separate responses to each area as detailed below.  The conceptual acquisition strategy includes an Organizational Conflict of Interest restriction in the Acquisition, Contracts Management and Administration enterprise domain contract.  This means that contractors that compete on that enterprise domain area will be precluded from competing on contracts in the other areas and vice versa.

This is NOT A REQUEST FOR TECHNICAL OR COST PROPOSALS.  The Government will not award a contract based on this Request for Information nor reimburse participants for information they provide.  This is a request for small businesses interested in serving as prime contractors to submit a brief capability statement demonstrating how they could meet the requirements in each of the enterprise domain areas.   The preliminary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, xxxxx Services, with a size standard of $23.5 million.

The contractors will be expected to provide non-personal services for Major Systems Acquisition Professional expertise in support of the enterprise domain areas for the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9), USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC.  This support is broad ranging, comprehensive, complex, and ever changing.  

The resultant contracts will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful offeror from participating in any other United States Coast Guard contracts.  To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments interests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technical expertise areas of the contractors actual CG-9 performance. 

The capability statements should focus on issues that affect the decision as to number/types of small business awards such as: 

(1) the breadth and depth of technical and management expertise to successfully execute all CG-9 Acquisition support services roles within each enterprise domain area,

(2) the capability to quickly ramp up qualified and trained personnel at the onset of the contract and/or task order, 

(3) the capability to administer and manage an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, task order contract with a potential dollar value from $20,000 to $650,000,000 across all domains, with numerous subcontractors, 

(4) assurance and demonstration that the small business firm or small business team will perform 50% of the work, 

(5) capability to perform realistic cost and schedule projections for complex technical and integrated efforts, 

(6) a contract management structure that allows for an integrated organization accountable for total performance responsibility, and 

(7) an understanding of DHS, Navy, DoD, and Government Agencies with whom USCG CG-9 interfaces.  

Firms that can meet requirements set forth above and as identified in a particular enterprise domain draft PWS are requested to provide a capabilities statement and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. 

This announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in providing complex professional major systems acquisition support services at the prime contractor level; and (2) to roughly gauge the capability of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level.  The Acquisition Directorate is exploring the potential to maximize small business opportunities for CG-9s Acquisition Major Systems Support Services.  Small businesses may team together (or even affiliate) and be eligible for award of a small business multiple award contract.   

The capability statements and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or teams ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process. However, these will be utilized to make final decision concerning number and types of enterprise domain areas. 

Submission shall be limited to no more than ten (10) pages for each separate enterprise domain area and must be submitted for each separate enterprise domain area.  

No more than four (4) pages should be used to address the General Contracting/Company Business Information Topics and no more than six (6) pages for each Draft PWS and Requirements related topics.  All questions are listed below.

<DESC>Notification to USACE Prime Contractors (Other than Small Business Concerns) on the implementation of the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS)<BR><BR>Please be advised that the Department of Defense (DoD) will use the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) for the October 2008 subcontracting reporting period. Prime contractors (Other than Small Business Concerns), along with their subcontractors, are required to submit subcontract reports using the eSRS for the October 2008 and all subsequent reporting periods. <BR><BR>Prime contractors are to modify all subcontracts subject to the flow down requirements of FAR 52.212-5 (Apr2008), 52.219.9 and 52.219-25 (Apr2008). This requires each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan to provide the prime contract number, their own DUNS number, and the e-mail address of the Government Contracting Officer or Contractor Official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the reports, to its subcontractors with subcontracting plans so their subcontractors can file Individual Subcontracting Report (ISR) former SF294 and Summary Subcontracting Report (SSR) former SF295 reports.<BR><BR>Instructions and training on eSRS can be found at http://www.esrs.gov. Contractors are advised to review the training materials located on this website prior to submitting a report. Training presentations can also be found on the DPAP website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/electronic_subcontracting_reporting_system.html. <BR><BR>If you have an unclassified contract with USACE that includes a subcontracting plan, you are required to file your reports using eSRS instead of sending in the hard copy Standard Forms 294 or 295. DoD and USACE will cease to accept SF 294s and 295s after the end of the FY 08 reporting period.<BR><BR>If you have any questions regarding eSRS, please contact the DoD eSRS Help Desk at dodesrshelpdesk@bta.mil. <BR>

Palletization:  The shipping (transport) containers shall be palletized. The pallets shall be 48-inch length x 40-inch width, general purpose, four-way entry, flush stringer, and double-face non-reversible pallets.  The palletized load shall not exceed 2500 pounds in weight for shipments to the Eastern Distribution Center (Burlington). The palletized load shall not exceed 2000 pounds in weight for shipments to the Western Distribution Center (French Camp and Stockton Locations). The palletized load shall not overhang the pallet deck board edge by more than 1 inch and shall not exceed 53 inches in overall height (including pallet). Less than half pallet loads or loads shipped by small package carrier in acceptable transport packing need not be palletized. When less than full but more than a half pallet is used, the palletized load shall utilize proper bracing and/or reinforcement to ensure that the load can withstand two additional loads placed on it. 

Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable. All wood pallet stringers shall be manufactured from hardwoods.  Pallets manufactured of materials other than wood, shall conform to all the requirements specified herein.

Unitization:  For the purpose of this requirement, the assembled group of containers or items in a single load that can be handled as a unit throughout the distribution system. Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 

Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

Notice of special requirements for shipment to all countries that have endorsed the IPPC Guidelines for treatment of non-manufactured wood packaging:  The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) has approved and published on March 15, 2002, Guidelines for Regulating Wood Packaging Material in International Trade.

	(4)	At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ``hourly rate'' for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ``hourly rate'' attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. *______*.
	(5)	(i)	If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may--
		(A)	By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or
		(B)	Terminate this contract for cause.
		(ii)	Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.
	(6)	Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--
		(i)	Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or
		(ii)	The conduct of one or more of the Contractor's employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor's managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.
	(7)	This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.
	(8)	The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.
	(9)	Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.
(b)	Assignment.  The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727).  However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract.

		                                            (1)	       If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.
		                                            (2)	       Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

		                               (A)	      If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractor's established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--
		                                            (1)	       Quantities being acquired; and
		                                            (2)	       Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.
		                               (B)	      Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor--
		                                            (1)	       Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or
		                                            (2)	       Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor's payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.
		                               (C)	      To the extent able, the Contractor shall--
		                                            (1)	       Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and

		                                            (2)	       Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price:  *______*.
	         (2)	    Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.
	         (3)	    Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.
	         (4)	    Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):
		                        (i)	  Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract;
		                       (ii)	  For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment--
		                               (A)	      The original timecards (paper-based or electronic);
		                               (B)	      The Contractor's timekeeping procedures;
		                               (C)	      Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and
		                               (D)	      Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.
		                      (iii)	  For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost--
		                               (A)	      Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and
		                               (B)	      Any documents supporting payment of those invoices.
	         (5)	    Overpayments/Underpayments.
		                        (i)	  Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The contractor's payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and request instructions for disposition of the overpayment.
		                       (ii)	  Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ``completion invoice'' and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
	         (6)	    Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.
		                        (i)	  Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.
		                       (ii)	  Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
		                      (iii)	  Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
	         (7)	    Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
	         (8)	    Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.
	         (9)	    Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.
(j)	Risk of loss.  Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss or damage to the supplies provided under this contract shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon:
	(1)	Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or
	(2)	Delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.
(k)	Taxes.  The contract price includes all applicable Federal, State, and local taxes and duties.
(l)	Termination for the Government's convenience.  The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.
(m)	Termination for cause.  The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance.  In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law.  If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.
(n)	Title.  Unless specified elsewhere in this contract, title to items furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession.
(o)	Warranty.  The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.
(p)	Limitation of liability.  Except as otherwise provided by an express warranty, the Contractor will not be liable to the Government for consequential damages resulting from any defect or deficiencies in accepted items.

(s)	Order of precedence.  Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) the schedule of supplies/services; (2) the Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, and Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts paragraphs of this clause; (3) the clause at 52.212-5; (4) addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) other paragraphs of this clause; (7) the Standard Form 1449; (8) other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) the specification.
(t)	Central Contractor Registration (CCR).
	(1)	Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data.  To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.  Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
	(2)	(i)	If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.  The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.
		(ii)	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
	(3)	The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).  Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database.  Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
	(4)	Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested.  If the Contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarder for less than carload shipments, the Contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.

If specified in an order placed under this contract, the Contractor shall, at the time each shipment is made on such order, furnish a notice of shipment to either the consignee or the ordering office or both, as specified.  This requirement may be satisfied by completion and return of appropriate forms furnished by the ordering office or by the furnishing of copies of bills of lading, freight bills, or similar documents in accordance with normal commercial practice if such document clearly identifies the order number, items and quantities shipped, date of shipment, point of origin, method of shipment and routing, and the name of initial carrier. 
F-FSS-300	SCHEDULING OF DELIVERIES TO GSA FACILITIES (FEB 2005) 
(a)	General:  This clause sets forth the scheduling requirements regarding deliveries to the General Services Administration (GSA) facilities listed below.  When the advance scheduling of delivery time is required or desired, the Contractor is advised that there may be an interval of up to 5 workdays between the time the consignee is contacted for a delivery date and the date the consignee is able to receive the shipment.  Consequently, to allow for the establishment of a delivery date and the time that is agreeable to both the consignee and the carrier, the carrier should be urged to communicate with the consignee as soon as practicable after it is known when the shipment will be available for pickup.  For all Distribution Center shipments and in the interest of effective and efficient deliveries, information such as National Stock Numbers (NSN), Delivery/Purchase Order numbers, quantity of cartons/pallets, and Uniform Product Codes are required when pre-scheduling deliveries.  Deliveries are not accepted on weekends or Federal holidays (except when scheduled in advance during national emergencies).  All times specified in this clause are local times.
(b)	Eastern Distribution Center:
(1)	Large-Load Shipments:  For the purpose of this clause, a shipment consisting of ten or more palletized unit loads, or, if the supplies are not palletized, a shipment weighing 10,000 pounds or more, or measuring 1,000 cubic feet or more, when transported by a single conveyance, is regarded as a "large-load" shipment.  The Contractor is required to notify the carrier on the bill of lading that a scheduled unloading date and time, during normal business hours, must be obtained by the consignee prior to the delivery of a "large-load" shipment.
(2)   Small-Load Shipments:  For the purpose of this clause, a shipment consisting of less than ten palletized unit loads, or if the supplies are not palletized, a shipment weighing less than 10,000 pounds and measuring less than 1,000 cubic feet, when transported by a single conveyance, is regarded as a "small-load" shipment.  The delivery of a "small-load" shipment need not be scheduled in advance of arrival at the facility.  However, the consignee may refuse to accept delivery if the truck arrives later in the afternoon than the time specified below for the receipt of unscheduled small loads.  The carrier should and is encouraged to communicate with the GSA facility (consignee) regarding all impending deliveries.
(c)	Western Distribution Center:  Carrier appointments are required to facilitate GSA clearance of the arriving carriers through site Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) security.  The Contractor is required to notify the carrier on the bill of lading that a scheduled unloading date and time must be obtained from the consignee prior to delivery.
(d)	Facility Addresses:                                                                 Scheduling

Section K
Representations, Certifications, and Other Statements of Offerors or Respondents
52.209-5  Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. 
As prescribed in 9.104-6, insert the following provision: 
CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (MAY 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principals, for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision)

<DESC>The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity ActA Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) and The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) stipulates that the Secretary of Transportation must make a number of determinations before a grant or loan can be made for the construction of any project seeking Section 5309 New Starts funds.  These determinations require that the planning process generate credible information on project costs, ridership, financing, and environmental impacts.   49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 Section 5309 contains criteria for determining whether New Start projects are eligible for funding.  The Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Office of Planning and Environment (TPE) assesses New Starts projects to verify that requirements for eligibility for New Starts funding have been met.  

Reviews of past New Starts projects have documented that ridership forecasts have frequently varied significantly from ridership experienced after those projects have been opened for service.  In addition, increasing numbers of project sponsors are seeking New Starts funding, yet cannot demonstrate that adequate planning information has been produced during alternatives analysis.  To support development of accurate information on New Starts projects seeking New Starts funding, the Office of Planning and Environment provides guidance, technical assistance and oversight of the planning and project development process.  The results of this procurement will help ensure that alternatives analyses produce reliable information that can support the identification of projects that merit federal investment.

The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contractor support services for providing technical assistance to FTA, TPE.  FTA anticipates that the required services will focus on the following functional/task areas:

1  Collection of data on transit ridership patterns 
2  Urban travel models
3  Forecasting for New Starts and Small Starts projects
4  Refinement of methods for FTA oversight of New/Small Starts travel forecasts

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a sole source purchase order for EMC maintenance to EMC Corporation. The order is to purchase EMC maintenance services for Enterprise Computing Centers campuses located Martinsburg, WV, Memphis, TN, and Detroit, MI during power downs necessary to perform power distribution maintenance.  

Enterprise Computing Centers requires EMC on-site vendor support for the three ECC campuses to power down and power up the Tier II EMC Storage Area Network equipment for up to 6 occurrences a year.  The power downs are necessary to perform power distribution maintenance at the locations.  The dates of the power downs vary from site to site and are to be determined as needs are identified.   EMC can only perform this service due to the leased EMC DASD storage located all ECC locations.  Thus, only EMC can service the storage systems otherwise, the IRS is at risk for any damage caused during the power outage and the equipment is not owned by the IRS.  

The IRS has a need for the following item:

CLIN 0001    Six (6) EMC maintenance services during Power Downs

All EMC equipment will need powered down prior to 0300 hours and status reported to the SDCC when completed. Power up must be completed by 1200 hours.  Total labor hours should not exceed 9 hours, the IRS will notify the EMC vendors of all known up coming power outages when they become known and hard dates are available.

The government intends to award a firm fixed price order. All responsible sources who can provide the above requirements shall submit written quotations no later than 1 day from the posted date of this announcement. No solicitation will be issued, therefore, requests for solicitations will be considered non-responsive. If no responses are received the award will be made to EMC Corporation.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) Policy 3.2.2.4 and AMS Policy 3.2.1.2.1 - this announcement is to conduct a Market Survey for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The FAA is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing Support Services to the FAA.  This support is for Operation Support Services. The anticipated contract period is five (5) years, a base year with four one year option periods.
This market survey is to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement - competitive, limited competition or single source.  The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Small Economically Disadvantaged (SEDB) 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under competitive procedures.
The FAA requires the following information from interested eligible SDVOSB or SEDB8(a) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for SDVOSB or eligible SEDB8(a) that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.  
The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) size standard codes for this requirement are 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, Size Standard $6.5 million; 541519 Other Computer Related Services and 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services
All costs associated with the preparation or submission of responses is the responsibility of the potential source.  The Government will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  PLEASE SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT OF WORK AND MARKET SURVEY RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS.

<SUBJECT>Philippines: Wastewater Treatment Systems and Facility Upgrades for Commercial Users Feasibility Study
<SOLNBR>0831033A
<RESPDATE>102408
<CONTACT>Evangela  Kunene, Phone 703-875-4357, Email ekunene@ustda.gov
<DESC>Reference is made to the September 29, 2008 amendment and September 10, 2008 announcement, solicitation number 0831033A, inviting questions from offerors who will submit qualifications and proposal data to develop a feasibility study to investigate onsite wastewater treatment options and/or technology upgrades for four treatment facilities to provide wastewater treatment services to commercial and industrial customers in metro Manila, Philippines.  

The Grantee ("MWCI") would like to amend the RFP and provide a new proposal delivery address.  All proposals should be delivered to the bid box at the Manila Water Office no later than 4:00PM Philippine LOCAL TIME, on October 24, 2008.  If using postal mail service or courier, the offeror should ensure that the delivery arrives on or before the deadline set here and in the RFP.  The addressee and place of delivery for all proposals is:  

To: Mr. Antonino T. Aquino, President
Thru: Ms. Marilou G. Bago, Sr. Manager  Logistics / Ms. Lyn Almario  Department Manager, Sustainable Development

Finance Department, 2nd Floor, MWSS Administration Bldg
Katipunan Road, 1105 Balara, Quezon City
Metro Manila, Philippines


Below are the list of questions that were received and the corresponding responses.  

Question 1.
Section J1. Qualifications, page 20, lists the suggested selection criteria.  Is this the criteria to be used by the MWCI selection committee?  Number 3 lists 5 experts with 5 points each for a total of 25 points.  Can this be interpreted that the Team Leader is the same value as the electrical engineer?

Answer 1.
Refer to Sections 2.3 and 4 of the RFP.  The Definitional Mission report is provided for background information only.  The RFP Award Criteria lists the maximum points given for each member of the project team as the same, in this case 5 points, regardless of the function.

Question 2.
Section J1.  Does point structure make it mandatory that the bidders bid staff as presented?  Would MWCI consider modifying the points structure if different experts were bid based on our opinion of best completing the FS?  For instance, there are 17 days for an electrical engineer and 32 days for a mechanical engineer.  For this type of FS, these inputs do not appear to be needed.  Manufactures can provide needed data and local engineers can assist with local field surveys.

Answer 2.
The Definitional Mission report is provided for background information only.  Refer to Sections 2.3 and 4 of the RFP.  The key personnel specified in Section 4 of the RFP are the mandatory requirements for the project based on Manila Water's assessment.  Bidders, may propose an alternative and/or additional functions apart from those specified in the RFP, providing a justification.  Please note that USTDA's grant funding is provided on a fixed price basis only.  The addition of functions will be considered by MWCI during the review of proposals and evaluated by following this formula: 
Points = (number of valid functions / total proposed functions) x 25

Question 3.
Section J1 and Appendix L1.  There are no points in J1.3. for the Scientist/Auto/Cad and Sponsor Liaison listed in Appendix L1. Are these intended to be all local staff? Are they staff of MWCI?  And if so, are their names and positions available? What are their rates?

Answer 3
The Definitional Mission report is provided for background information only.  Refer to Sections 2.3, 2.20 and 4 of the RFP.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to identify and propose an appropriate team to complete the full Terms of Reference in Annex 4 and 5.  

Question 4.
Appendix L1.  If the sponsor liaison is not MWCI, then can MWCI advise who is appropriate? Maybe they can select a local team(s) and supply the name(s) to all the bidders?

Answer 4.
The Definitional Mission report is provided for background information only.  Refer to Sections 2.3 and 2.20 of the RFP.  Appendix L1 in the report was a budget estimate used by USTDA in order to establish the fixed price value of the grant amount.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to identify and hire any local team members/subcontractors.    

Question 5.
Appendix LI  TOR. Is there any information on the industrial/commercial dischargers('traders)?  A summary of their business, discharges, amount of pre-treatment, locations? Does DENR have this information and does MWCI have access to it? 

Answer 5.
The Definitional Mission report is provided for background information only.  Refer to Section 2.3, Annex 4 and 5 in the RFP.  The Terms of Reference are found in Annex 4 and 5 of the RFP, not in the Definitional Mission report.  

The information requested will be provided to the selected Contractor, following contract signing, for purposes of conducting the feasibility study.  There is publicly available information online.  MWCI encourages offerors to use public resources, as they see fit, in preparing their proposal.  

Question 6.
Is there any further information on the existing WWT facilities operated by MWCI? 

Answer 6.
This information will be provided to the selected Contractor, following contract signing, for purposes of conducting the feasibility study.  The Terms of Reference in Annex 4 and 5 provide sufficient information for the purposes of submitting a proposal.  There is also publicly available information online.  

Question 7.
Regarding the following statement, on page 1 of the TOR, "The Contractor shall identify onsite wastewater treatment systems for 6 individual, different types of commercial customers, and the Grantee shall identify the 6 customers to be considered." Can MWCI provide a general description of the end product of the various types of commercial customers? Are the commercial users major industries or small scale "cottage" type industries? 

Answer 7.
Greater detail and specific information will be provided to the selected Contractor, following contract signing, for purposes of conducting the feasibility study.  This information is not needed for purposes of submitting a proposal to conduct the feasibility study.  

Generally speaking, most of the current non-domestic customers are retail and restaurant businesses.  Smaller and medium scale enterprises ("cottage") are found most often in domestic households and thus contribute to what is classified as "domestic" sewage.  Heavy industry wastewater is treated by the industries themselves to comply with government effluent discharge standards; however there is the possibility that future expansion of sewer network effluents from heavy industries, treated or partially treated, may be sent to MWCI plants, particularly in light of the current strategy of combined sewer systems.  The Clean Water Act details pre-treatment standards that MWCI, as the concessionaire, may implement 'by contract' in the absence of guidelines from DENR.  

Question 8.
Page 1, paragraph 2 of the TOR states, "the Study will identify necessary wastewater treatment technology for wastewater conditioning for reuse." Could you please clarify if this analysis will be done for each of the 4 existing wastewater treatment facilities or, as is referred to on page 26 of the DM, the analysis will only be needed for "one currently planned wastewater facility?" 

Answer 8.
Refer to Annex 4 and 5 of the RFP.  The Terms of Reference in the Grant Agreement detail the required work to be performed as part of the feasibility study.  The DM report is background information only as detailed in Section 2.3 of the RFP.

Only one reuse analysis will be required. This assumes that all effluent will have the same characteristics, regardless of the inflow parameters.

Question 9. 
Page 15 of the RFP (Section 4), #1, states that part of the award criteria will be based on "1.2 Offeror's overseas experience: 10 points". Does overseas refer specifically to work in the Philippines or just work outside of the U.S.? 

Answer 9.
The Grantee will use the following point valuation, 10 being the maximum possible points awarded. For Offerors that do not have experience in the Philippines, the Grantee will add accumulated experience based on the following: 
			
Experience in Southeast Asia                 5 points
Experience in the Philippines 	10 points
Total possible points:                              10 points

Question 10.
Page 15 of the RFP (Section 4), # 3, gives a list of 5 discipline titles. Is the Offeror allowed to propose a project team with greater or fewer than 5 people? In addition, can 1 person fulfill two roles? 

Answer 10.
MWCI will require at least one dedicated person for each role.  

Question 11.
Page 12, paragraph 1 of the DM lists water quality standards of 50 ppm BOD and 75 ppm TSS. Are these standards the current standards for industry throughout the service area? In addition, will these be the requirements for effluent discharged to the existing wastewater treatment facilities, or for effluent discharged from the existing wastewater treatment facilities into open waterways? 

Answer 11.
The DENR DAO 35 effluent discharge standards for Class C water is as follows:


Parameter	Maximum Allowable
BOD5	50 mg/L
COD	100 mg/L
TSS	70 mg/L
Oil & Grease	5 mg/L
Total Coliforms 10,000 MPN/100 mL

These are for effluent discharge into receiving bodies of water.

The Clean Water Act provides pre-treatment standards for non-domestic wastewater generators before they can discharge to the sewer systems they are connected to.  However, the allowable levels are not yet defined by DENR.  MWCI is currently drafting its own pre-treatment standards, relying heavily on the quality standards for domestic wastewater which was used as the design criteria for the existing wastewater treatment facilities. 

Question 12.
Is there any shotcrete (gunite or pneumatically applied concrete), pressure grout of SewperCoat involved in this project?

Answer 12.
This RFP is in reference to a feasibility study that will recommend several technology and equipment options for MWCI business objectives.  No material is being procured or specified at this stage.
