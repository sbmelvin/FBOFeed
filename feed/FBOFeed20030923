<CONTACT>Stephanie Pascale, Contract Specialist, (973) 724-2774
<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the development and system integration of a Small Arms Lightweight Family  of Weapons and Ammunition (LFWA). The LFWA will provide a lethality component of the Objective Force Warrior (OFW) program.  The initial focus of the LFWA program will be on developing a lightweight machine gun and ammunition. The objective is a "clean slate" approach that will yield ammunition and weapons that are reproducible in quantity, robust, easy to operate and maintain, and reliable under all conditions, while taking up less volume and weighing 30-40% less than current systems. The contractor(s) shall devote their engineering and scientific skills to conceive and design virtual prototypes of the entire family of weapons and ammunition, and shall fabricate, test and deliver non-working full scale models of the proposed Light Machine Gun with inert ammunition and full up working Light Machine Gun prototypes with live ammunition, as described in the BAA. Each offeror’s proposal, to include proposed designs, should not be restricted by current weapons, weapon mechanisms, ammunition or ammunition handling. Two major demonstrations of the new system are currently planned. The first will be a non-firing demo in mid FY06 to support the OFW Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD). The second demonstration will be an early operational assessment using full-up weapons and live ammunition, scheduled to be held in late FY07. The planned period of performance is expected to be three Phases with Phase I consisting of nine months, Phase II consisting of 28 months and Phase III consisting of five months. There may be downselect criteria for both Phases II and/or III if multiple awards are made.  It is anticipated that a BAA will be released on or about 15 October 2003. Refer to any attached documents for possible changes to the closing date and time. All responses to this notice shall be submitted in the English language. No telephone requests shall be honored.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS NOT AN ACQUISITION PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION.  THIS SYNOPSIS PROVIDES NOTICE THAT THE FHWA PLANS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIS PROGRAM WILL RESULT IN COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT AWARDS. The Safety Core Business Unit of the Federal Highway Administration is contemplating the award of multiple (approximately 2 to 4) demonstration and evaluation projects for a performance period of 28 months.  A total of $775,000 in Federal funds is available in fiscal year 2003 to fund from two to four demonstration and evaluation projects for a performance period of 28 months.  Individual award amounts are expected to range between $150,000 – $300,000.  Applicants must provide a minimum of a 20 percent match of the Federal funding towards the project. The applicant’s 20 percent match requirement can be met through direct financial contribution or through “in-kind” services.  This request for application (RFA) will only be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Accordingly, NO written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the RFA package will be accepted. The Government anticipates issuing a RFA package on or about May 5, 2003, by posting it on the website www.fedbizopps.gov. Estimated proposal due date is on or about June 5, 2003. Since this RFA will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps.gov website for both the RFA package and any amendments.  The objective of these demonstration and evaluation projects is to determine the extent to which rationally established, well-publicized, and rigorously enforced speed limits lead to higher compliance and improved safety. This cooperative agreement program requires each recipient to conduct a carefully planned demonstration of setting and enforcing rational speed limits.  The recipient will designate a specific demonstration community (or group of communities).  A demonstration community is the geopolitical area where the rational speed limit demonstration will take place.  This could be a State, a county, a city, a township, a borough, or any defined geographic entity or group of geographic entities within the United States with a clear governing body.  All application forms may be found under fhwa.dot.gov/aaa/hamhome.htm.  Scroll down and click on Grants/Cooperative Agreements.  All questions, comments, or concerns, shall be e-mailed to Lise Lyles, Contract Specialist, at Lise.Lyles@fhwa.dot.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA 93042-5001 plans to procure on a competitive basis fabrication, testing and delivery of two Fast Attack Craft Targets (FACT).  In addition, the boats will be delivered with one licensable trailer for legally transporting the target on US roadways.  FACT is to be a self-propelled target capable of simulating various threat scenarios while under remote control.  The government will design and install the remote control equipment.  The boat offered must be a close derivative of a commercial boat currently in production, which therefore requires minimal development.  Physical characteristics include a minimum of 50 feet in length and must be capable of sustained speeds in excess of 50 knots in fully-developed sea state two (10 knot wind with 2 to 3 foot seas) with a 24 hour endurance including an 80nm transit to a proposed operating area, 20 minutes at 35 knots and 30 minutes at 50 knots, and 80nm return to the point of origin.  The FACT additionally will be built and tested in accordance with the government specification provided with the solicitation.  It is anticipated the boats will be delivered eight months after contract award.  The government intends to award two contracts for one FACT each on a best value basis to the two highest rated offers, considering all source selection criteria, submitted in response to the solicitation.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued on or about 13 October 2003 and will be available through the 2.0 Contracts Competency home pages at: https://contracts.nawcwd.navy.mil/rfp-nawc.htm.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be furnished unless absolutely necessary. The anticipated due date for proposals is 14 November 2003; however, the actual proposal due date will be stated in the solicitation when issued. Proposal must be written in English and all costs proposed must be in US dollars.  If you would like to receive email notification when the solicitation is posted, please contact Gary Trimble via email at gary.trimble@navy.mil.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/VSE-B), Kirtland AFB NM, is interested in receiving proposals (technical and cost) on research to advance and demonstrate the technologies required to enable an advanced missile Guidance, Navigation and Control system, and other closely related Ballistic Missile technologies. The total program budget for these efforts is approximately $53.2 million over five years. The government anticipates making up to four (4) contract awards but reserves the right to make more or less than four (4) awards based on the evaluation criteria specified. Funds are not presently available for this effort. Offerors are advised to contact the technical point of contact to verify interest in the effort to be proposed and funding availability PRIOR to committing resources to the preparation of proposals in response to this announcement. B. REQUIREMENTS. Proposals are desired for advanced Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system designs and technologies that could lead to an integrated system for flight demonstration. The research area of interest is enabling GNC technologies for missile boost, post-boost, and terminal phases. Proposals for technologies which could enable future ballistic systems with enhanced GNC performance, reliability, maintainability, supportability, and affordability goals and which enhance performance and significantly reduce cost, schedule, or risk of existing technologies are of interest. Future GNC systems for advanced ballistic missile lift and reentry systems must perform to increasingly more demanding requirements for: 1) affordable, lower cost, 2) higher precision weapon deployment and targeting accuracy, 3) minimization of size and power, 4) immunity to space like hostile environments, 5) high mean time between failures and 6) robust units requiring minimal hands-on maintenance and environmental conditioning. The technologies needed to meet the anticipated strategic navigation, guidance and control requirements of the 2020 timeframe and beyond may be considered a revolutionary change from the current state-of-the-art fielded systems. These systems would satisfy the strategic requirements for the Air Force and Navy and also meet the size, weight, power and cost requirements of the precision strike initiatives. The technical challenge will be to develop the GNC technology to obtain the high precision sensors required for strategic applications, while keeping the cost, size, weight and power low enough to support nonstrategic applications. The envisioned performance goals are on the order of 0.01 degree/hr bias drift rate, with a scale factor error of 0.4 ppm for gyros, and a 1 micro-g bias stability with a scale factor error of 1 ppm for accelerometers with aiding by jam-resistant GPS technology. Work performed under any resulting contract may be classified up to the Secret Level. The DD 254 is attached hereto. The contractor(s) who is/are selected for an award under this PRDA may be required and then must be eligible to obtain a Secret facility clearance. Technical point of contact: AFRL/VSE-B, Dr. Sandra H. Slivinsky, 505-846-7222, fax 505-846-5589, email sandra.slivinsky@kirtland.af.mil. Open communication with the technical POC is encouraged until proposals are received. C. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: Proposals shall be due 45 days from the date of this announcement.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  

The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to procure selected spare parts managed by the DSCP, Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC), and Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR).  Under this effort, called the Strategic Material Sourcing/Rapid Manufacturing Initiative (SMS/RMI), parts have been arranged into various market baskets that group items based on their shared attributes.  Federal Supply Groups (FSGs) to be included in this effort include: 10, 17, 20, 25, 34, 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 53, 62, and 81.  

The market baskets are comprised of a mixture of high and low demand items, and consider other industry attributes such as similar manufacturing processes and/or materials, and prospective competitive representation.  Specific information associated with this initiative will be available at http://www.dscp.dla.mil/gi/smsrmi/.

The market baskets for Phase 1 have been posted as links to this presolicitation notice. Prospective offerors are requested to review and provide comments on the market baskets, considering suitability for small business participation and the offeror's capability to supply the full range of items in each basket. 

The resultant contract(s) terms will provide for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity types with an anticipated eleven (11) year contract term, consisting of a 5-year base period and three (3) 2-year option periods.  All items to be furnished under the resultant contract(s) will be ordered by issuance of delivery orders.    Each contract entered into under this prospective program will include surge and wartime readiness sustainment requirements.   We anticipate the use of Electronic Commerce. 

This Presolicitation Notice has been designated as a partial small business set-aside on the Fed Biz Ops for identification purposes only. This identification is to draw attention to both small and large business. Commensurate with shared attributes and competitive representation specific to each market basket, it is anticipated that respective market baskets will be identified as either a Hub Zone, 8A, Veteran Owned, Veteran Disabled, Woman Owned, Total set aside, Partial set aside or Unrestricted. Market baskets identified as unrestricted will be limited to those requirements where there is no reasonable expectation that at least two responsible small business offers will be received; as substantiated by prior experience, market research, and industry feedback. 

Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government use only.   However, DSCP’s intent is to develop an RFP from the aggregate of the information provided from industry as a whole. 
Please provide written responses by close of business September 30, 2003 via email to Ruth.Herman@dla.mil or via fax to (215) 737-7963.  All responses should reference RFI no. SP0500-03-I-0001.

<DESC>Below find Government responses to industry questions posed since the original broad agency announcement:    
Q1. Specify the proper format for Resume section of the white paper.
A1. The proper format is MS Word.

Q2. May offerors format the Technical /Management section of the white paper in formats other than MS Word?
A2.  The Government requires MS Word format for the Technical /Management section of the white paper. Offerors should format so that the Government can read both electronic and printed versions.

Q3. If submitting multiple white papers, should offerors submit a consent to administrative access form with each white paper? 
A.3 Yes; AFMCFARS 5352.215-9007 referenced in the original broad agency announcement now specifies Schafer Corp., Chelmsford, MA, as non-Government advisors for review and analysis of submittals. Either embed the offeror’s authorized individual’s digital signature on the signature line in this provision, or send a signed hard copy of the provision.              

Q4. Does the Government require a cover sheet with each of the four sections of the white paper? 
A4. The Government requires a cover sheet for the technical management section of the white paper and that offerors identify other sections with the project title. The Government does not require a cover page with other sections.  

Q5. Should offerors design each of four components of white papers as a separate computer data file?
A5. Yes. 

Q6. What is the proper submittal medium for white papers?
A6.  The proper medium for Part 1 white papers is one CD-R; attachment two cost proposal instructions applies only to those offerors selected to present Part 2 oral presentations.   

Q7. May DoE Federally-funded research and development centers (FFRDC’s) submit white papers on their own behalf or in association with others?
A7.  Only Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is excluded from proposing under this broad agency announcement based on a real or apparent conflict of interest within JTO management. Other FFRDC’s may compete consistent with constraints found within the broad agency announcement.  

Q8. Clarify the reference to firm offers relating to white paper submission in the BAA.  
A8. Offerors should submit a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate with white paper submissions. The Government will not consider this a firm offer, but an estimate subject to negotiation.         

Q9. In section BC: 02) Beam Control: Atmospheric disturbance – define the term “complex visibility.”
A9.  Complex visibility-the Fourier transform of the object flux angular distribution. In simpler terms, if one can provide a measure of the complex visibility, one has a measure of the visibility modulus and visibility phase simultaneously.  

Q10. What is the acceptable annual cost ceiling for proposed projects?  
A10. Proposals in the advanced laser topic area are limited to $200k for the basic (first year) effort.  All other topic areas are limited to $1M for the basic effort and $1M for the option.  The option year of an Advanced Laser proposal may not exceed $1M, but the Government may make awards greater than $200k only in cases that have a large potential for exceeding existing technology efforts. The Government may unilaterally exercise the option based on funding availability for the topic area, the potential value of the proposed option year effort to the Government, and on the success of the basic contract.   

Q11.  Reference Section CL: 04) Deuterium Fluoride (DF) Laser: Exhaust Free operation:  Does Exhaust Free Operation equate to, or mean the same thing as, sealed exhaust? 
A11.  Yes.  Plume free operation is analogous to sealed exhaust system.

Q12.  Does the three-page limitation for the technical/management section include tables, figures, pictures and references?
A12.  Yes.  The Government will count any information necessary to convey the required information against the three-page limit.  The Government will not evaluate appendices or other addenda to the technical/management section that exceed the three-page limit.

Q13.  Will the Government consider a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) as a possible contractual vehicle for award under this solicitation?
A13.  No.  The Government will award only contracts.

Q14.  How may industry partner with DoD organizations under this BAA?
A14.  Industrial offerors may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement for facility support services as part of their offer under the BAA to use Government available laboratories, test ranges, or other facilities.  The JTO or other source will separately and directly pay for these services. The Government will consider the cost for these services part of the total cost of the BAA contract and count them against the cost cap; the offeror must account for these costs in the ROM and any subsequent cost proposals. The offeror may use an existing DoD cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) or technology investment agreement (TIA) under this BAA.
Q15. The BAA expresses interest in "eye safe" lasers in the 1.5-1.8 um region. Has the Government interest in other "eye safe" wavelengths within atmospheric windows?
A15. The Government has interest in other wavelengths if found within a window that allows good propagation through the atmosphere.
Q16.  What is the required ROM cost estimate format? 
A.16. There is no standard format for the ROM cost estimate.  It can be as brief
as a one single dollar figure that represents the estimated cost of the work
proposed but may also be a breakdown of the major components of the items
that make up the costs (e.g. Labor, materials, etc.) and could also be
broken down by Tasks.  The breakdown of the total costs should typically be no more than ten items.

Q17. Will the Government consider a single white paper that addresses more than one technical area?
A17. Yes.


Q18. Will the Government accept white papers in Times New Roman 10 font size? 
Q18. Yes. 

Q19. Will the Government accept the schedule in Fast Track instead of MS Project?
A.19. No. End of questions and answers.

QUESTIONS and ANSWERS PERTAINING TO
        REQUEST FOR QUOTATION
               03L000003

Title: HHS Uiversity Academic Partnerships

1.Question: Are you looking for one entity that could offer all
            types of courses, on site classroom , e-learning,
            telecourses? Or could a proposal be submitted for 
            just one type of course, for instance ,e-learning?
  Answer:   A proposal could be submitted for one type of access, but we are hoping the contractor can provide various means of access to their coursework, in order to maximize the benefit to HHS employees nationwide.
2.Question: What does a firm–fixed price inclusive of all
charges for all sites mean? Does a firm-fixed unit price inclusive of all charges include software costs, admission fee and course material costs?
  Answer:  Additional fees for books and materials is expected, but firm fixed price applies to the per credit rate for courses. The rate should be constant for all HHS employees, regardless of duty station or place of residence.  
3.Question: What is the “unit cost”? Semester Credit Hour? 
            Quarter Credit Hour? Per Course?
Answer: Unit cost is a semester credit hour.
4.Question:  How many on-site , e-learning, or telecourses can
             be offered? Can a universities complete catalog be 
Answer:  There is no limit on the amount of courses offered.  Universities can offer their complete catalog in the proposal.
5.Question:  How much detail would you like provided on the 
             individual courses proposed?
  Answer:  As long as the contractor already provides catalogs, program guides or other print media that describes its courses, there is no need to provide detail at the individual course level.
6.Question:  Do you want information on every course in a 
            program?  For instance there may be 40 courses in a
            baccalaureate degree program.  Do want information 
            and pricing on each course or information on the 
            degree program?

  Answer: No, there is no need to cover every course in a program, as long as the contractor already provides catalogs, program guides or other print media that describes its courses in sufficient detail. Pricing should be presented in a per credit basis.  General information should cover types of programs, certificate or degrees.  There is no need to provide information on every course.
7.Question:  What is the suggested format and maximum length 
             for proposal responses?
  Answer:  The technical proposal should be no longer than 20 pages and should address the contractor’s ability to meet the requirements.  The business proposal shall provide the cost information for courses on a per credit hour basis and any separate costs that may be course specific materials or resources.  
8.Question:  What are your evaluation expectations at both the 
           course and partnership levels?
Answer:   There are no specific course level evaluation expectations, other than compliance to any terms a potential contractor intends to submit in the proposal. The partnership evaluation expectations are based on the actual accessibility and utilization of the contractor’s services.
9.Questions: Most State Universities do not supply books and 
           materials with courses.  These are purchased by the
           student from a designated vendor.  Would this system 
           of supplying books, workbooks, and other materials 
           required for the course be acceptable?
  Answer: Yes.
10.Questions: Can fees (such as for information technology) be
              excluded in the course cost?
  Answer: If “information technology” is defined as a course specific material or resource, then it can be a separate cost, passed to the student.
11.Questions: Some courses have pre-requisites.  Can these 
              courses be included. Who will establish that the
              student meets the pre-requisite.
  Answer:  Yes.  Completion of the pre-requisite is the responsibility of the contractor.
12.Questions: Can travel for on-site programs be billed as 
              incurred?
  Answer:  All costs (except books and other course specific materials) should be included in the per credit rate for the course.
13.Questions: In what format should we communicate course 
              information such as length of time & class size
              minimums/maximums?
  Answer:  Existing electronic or print material can be sent to HHS upon award of the contract.
14.Questions: You refer to both a “technical proposal” and a 
              “business proposal” in the announcement.  Are 
               these one in the same?
  Answer: No.  Reference answer to question number 7. The technical proposal shall not include price information.  
15.Questions: Please define and provide examples of 
             “telecourses”.  Would these include video-
              conference delivered courses?
  Answer: Telecourses would cover alternative types of distance learning.  Video conferencing would be included in telecourses.
16.Questions: Please define and provide examples of the content
              you seek in the “technical approach” section of
              the proposal.
  Answer: The technical proposal shall be written in sufficient detail to clearly and conscisely demonstrate the contractor’s ability to provide the services required and explain how the project will be organized, staffed and managed.
17.Questions: In your statement “one tuition rate for all HHS 
              employees”, are you referring to charging one rate 
              to all people regardless of location, etc. or are 
              you seeking the same tuition rate for all courses?
  Answer:  One rate to all HHS employees, regardless of location.
18.Questions: Are you seeking both credit and non-credit
              courses?
  Answer: Ideally, credit courses are preferred, but non-credit courses can be presented.
19.Questions: Are you seeking both graduate and undergraduate
              courses?
  Answer: Yes
20.Questions: Please define what you mean by “accredited 
              academic courses”?
       
  Answer:  Courses that are accredited by an organization that is recognized by the US Department of Education.
21.Questions: What is your definition of a “certificate
              program”?
  Answer:  A series of courses focused in one area of study.
22.Questions: Relative to on-site delivered courses, do you 
              expect the university partner to identify the 
              physical facilities used for these deliveries and 
              make the logistical arrangements with these 
              facilities for delivery of these programs?
             
  Answer:  Yes
23.Questions: Can we add new program offerings as they are 
              developed?
  Answer: Yes
24.Questions: Will we have an opportunity to modify prices in 
              future option periods?
  Answer: Yes
25.Questions: What expectations does HHS have for the
              recuperation of facilities and administrative 
              costs?

  Answer: There are no expectations of administrative costs and recuperation of facilities to be passed on to HHS.  All costs for coursework (except for books and other course-specific materials) should be included in the per credit cost.

26.Questions: Can the course offerings be expanded and or 
              modified during a project period or in subsequent 
              project periods?
  Answer Yes
26.Questions: If a student does not complete a course does the 
              accredited institution return all, part or none of
              the course fee?
  Answer  Once enrolled in a course, the student abides by the rules of the institution; and must adhere to its refund policies.

<SOLNBR>ESUP
<RESPDATE>091003
<CONTACT>Captain Jay Kilpatrick,937-904-4317
<DESC>UPDATE (9-23-03) Paragraph 1 below of the ESUP T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP) RFI  issued on 8-28-03 stated that the government would be conducting an Industry  Day 29 Sep 2003 and that the specific time and location were yet to be  determined.  Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated. POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Capt Jason Ortiz  (Buyer), 937-904-4306.

UPDATE:  The purpose of this update is to give a historical perspective for how  we contract for efforts associated with the steam lines, that are being  utilized for 6 months out of the year.  After the contractors accomplish all  efforts that can be accomplished prior to actually interrupting the steam  lines, the contractor will often be put into dormancy for a specified period of  time.  The contract will be extended for that amount of time, beyond the  original schedule.  All work would need to be completed prior to the start up  of the steam lines on 01 Oct of the following year.

No other changes are hereby  incorporated. UPDATE:  This update is to incorporate Addendum Number 2 to the  specifications.  The Specification is hereby being corrected for the maximum  permissible heat loss.  See Addendum Number 2 for more information. UPDATE:  This update is to add the clause entitled Small Business Program  Representations, FAR 52.219-1, to Section K of the solicitation.  Subparagraphs  (a) and (b) are filled in with a NAICS code of 234910 and a size standard of  $28.5M, respectively.  No other changes are hereby incorporated.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-03-00181
<RESPDATE>092203
<ARCHDATE>10222003
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, David Boris, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2158
<DESC>NAICS Code: 333131   This amendment to RFQ-OH-03-00181 is being issued to clarify the following questions, the answers immediately follow the question. 1) The coal bunker height is specified to be 48" high above grade. It is very unlikely that the system can be configured to accommodate  this requirement. We anticipate the top of the coal bunker to be approximately 120" above grade. Moreover, a total overall height of 150" is need for the mill's air relief bag. It may be possible to employ a horizontal screw conveyor in conjunction with a bucket elevator but this would only result  in an overall height of approximately 75" above grade for the coal bunker. The bucket elevator would complicate the system and add to the overall cost. We wish to submit our offer based on overall bunker height of 120", is this acceptable? Answer:  The only height specification was for the coal  bin.  This is to accommodate loading of the coal into the bin using a Bobcat front-end loader.  An overall bunker height of 120 inches is acceptable. 2) Explosion proof motors and electrical enclosures are specified. However your RFQ does not indicate the hazardous area defined by the NEC  (National Electric Code. At this point, we are assuming that the area classification should confirm to NEC Class 2 (environments containing explosives dusts) Division 1 ( explosive dust is always present ) Group G (dusts containing carbon). We assume this is correct but you need to confirm this.  Answer:  The pulverizing system will need to comply with the NEC requirements for coal dust areas.  This is NEC Class 2, Division 1, Group F (atmospheres containing coal dust). 3.  Please advise any space constraints regarding installation area available for the pulverizing system. Answer:  There  are not any space constraints.   4.  Please advise how many 55 gallon drums are to be filled simultaneously from the system. Answer:  The system shall have the ability to fill one (1) 55 gallon drum at a time. 5.  Please advise if the 55 gallon drums are to be  maneuvered manually into place  for filling and removal or do you require automatic maneuvering of the 55 gallon drums into place along with automatic  removal of the 55 gallon drums once filled. Answer:  The 55 gallon drums will be placed and removed manually.  An automated system is not required. 6.  Power service description  indicates that only single  phase 220 or 110 volt service is available. Please advise  that 460/3/60 hz. electrical service is available.  Answer:  460/3/60 is NOT available on the site. 7. The coal storage bin specifications indicate that the bin must not exceed 4 feet in height. Our assumption  is that the bin will be filled from a dump truck. Please clarify that this is the loading sequence the EPA is looking at using.  Answer:  The bin will be filled with a Bobcat front-end loader.  The height of the bucket is 4 feet. 8. Please advise if all system electrical equipment must be  contained in the pulverizing system area or can we put the power side of the electrical equipment out of this area and locate only local control equipment in the pulverizing system area. Please advise distance from remote area to pulverizing area if applicable. Answer:  The power side of the  electrical equipment can be located away from the pulverizing system.  However, it is desirable to have the electrical equipment within 20 feet of the pulverizer to minimize the size of the shelter. 9.  Please advise if the outside shelter is completely enclosed or just has a roof shelter with  open sides and or ends or what configuration.  Answer:  The outside shelter has not been designed/constructed.  The temporary shelter will be a roof with open sides.  The permanent shelter will be designed at a later time. 10.  Please advise if progress payments paid on milestone fabrication  targets is applicable to this contract. Answer: Progress payments are not authorized.  Offerors shall submit all questions by  Thursday 25 September, 2003.  Quotations are due no later than Monday SEPTEMBER 29, 2003 AT 12:00 PM EST to Mr. David Boris as follows: via regular mail: U.S. EPA,  Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division, 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45268, or via Express Mail/Hand Carry: U.S. EPA, 4411 Montgomery Road, Suite 300, Norwood, OH 45212. Faxed quotations are acceptable and may be sent to (513) 487-2109. Quotations may sent electronically via  e-mail to boris.david@epa.gov. Questions or comments may be directed in writing to David Boris  via e-mail or fax.

<SUBJECT>R -- Robins AFB Chili Cook-Off
<DESC>On October 25, 2003 Robins Air Force Base Civilian Recreation will be hosting its annual Chili Cook-Off at Robins Park.  The best chefs of RAFB will cook before an audience of approximately 250 people.  The audience will primarily consist of active duty military, DoD civilians, retirees, reservists and their family members.
The Chili Cook-Off is an all day event with the best chefs of RAFB competing to see who makes the meanest chili.  The cooking teams can have up to six people and they must cook their chili on-site.  Those who don’t cook can come out to sample the chili and then compare their idea of good chili to the ones of our judges.  The winning team not only gets bragging rights, but also will represent Robins AFB at the State Chili Cook-Off in Macon, GA for Spring 2004.
For this “hot” event we would like to partner with companies and individuals who are interested in providing cash and in-kind for T-shirts, trophies, tasting packages (solo cups, spoons, crackers, etc.) and goody bags for the teams.  
Would your company like to be a part of the Chili Cook-Off this year?  If so, we can offer you possible logo and/or name recognition in promotional event materials, our Services Edge magazine (15,000 published per month), our Services website, the Rev-Up (20,000 published per week) and even on an event thank you sign.  (All opportunities above are dependent on the total value of your donation.) Those interested in participating should contact Marisa Barber at (478) 926-5492 no later than October 31, 2003.

The contract will be for 5 and one-half years,  which is an AE Contract term extension of 6 months and an increase of $500,000 in capacity from $7,500,000 to $8,000,000. The contract is an Indefinite Delivery Term master planning services contract that was advertised in the Commerce Business Daily 10 J anuary 1999 in support of Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. The contract was awarded to Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., Airside Business Park, 100 Airstrip Drive, Moon Township, PA 15108 for one twelve-month base year and four twelve-month option periods. The last qu arter of FY03 is expected to require a number of installation master planning requirements, which will include multiple task orders for DD 1391 preparation, barracks master plans, and GIS sustainment. Because of the AEs experience and the customers desire to continue working with this AE, services from any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. The U. S.
