<DESC>Background

	The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is part of the legislative branch of the federal government. CRS, which is a department of the Library of Congress, works exclusively as a nonpartisan analytical, research, and reference arm for U.S. Congress. The CRS mission is to provide information and analytic support leading to an informed national legislature.  

	CRS provides the Congress, throughout the legislative process, comprehensive and reliable legislative research, analysis and information services that are timely, non-partisan, and confidential, thereby contributing to an informed national legislature. The vision of CRS is that the Congress turns to CRS first when it is in need of legislative, research analysis or information in addressing the issues of the Nation.  As an organization, CRS has adopted the values of client service, uncompromising integrity, total quality, mutual respect and diversity. 

	To ensure that its resources are used most effectively in support of its mission, CRS is making significant staffing adjustments in response to technology-driven changes in the way it performs work for the Congress.  These staffing adjustments will result in the elimination of 59  administrative/product preparation, technical support assistant, and audio/visual support positions.  The affected staff will be offered separation options through Voluntary Early Retirement Authority and a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (i.e. buy-out).  Many are eligible for voluntary regular retirement and some are eligible for early retirement.  Most of the technical support assistants, however, are not eligible for early retirement.  All 59 staff face major decisions to: 1) retire or separate by January 3, 2006; 2) remain with CRS and hope to be selected into new jobs being created; or 3) seek employment elsewhere.  Those who remain in the eliminated positions will be subject to a reduction-in-force on September 30, 2006.  

	CRS will be creating and competitively filling new and different administrative, product preparation, and technology support positions that reflect the functions that are currently needed to support its research and analytical work.  The Service is confident that fewer staff will be required, and some functions may be performed at a lower grade level or contracted out.

	CRS intends to provide each individual whose position is being eliminated with the tools, including retirement and career counseling, to make the best possible decision with the least amount of personal and organizational disruption.  

Scope of Work

	CRS requires expert on-site career counseling/career transition services for up to 59 employees whose positions are being eliminated.  These services will include one-on-one career counseling and monthly group workshops on various career transition topics.  


General Requirements

	Services must be provided by a career counselor with education, training, and experience in career development, such as a Master Career Counselor or National Certified Career Counselor.  The career counselor providing services must follow the ethical guidelines of organizations such as the National Career Development Association, the National Board for Certified Counselors, the American Counseling Association, or the American Psychological Association.

	The contractor must have experience with career counseling for technical support personnel and experience with counseling federal government employees.  


Specific Requirements

	The contractor will provide on-site career counseling services to the CRS staff whose positions are being eliminated.  Services will be provided for one working day each week, during normal business hours on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of each week.  These services will include, but not be limited to, the following (the contractor may propose additional services to be provided within the one day per week timeframe):  

1)	personal counseling sessions to clarify career goals; 

2)	assistance with identification of interests, skills, and career options;

3)	assistance in developing and improving resumes;

4)	assistance in developing job hunting strategies and skills;

5)	practice in interviewing skills; 

and

6)	monthly workshops, open to the 59 employees, on career transition topics such as networking, negotiating salaries and benefits, finding hidden employment opportunities, and marketing yourself to employers.  The workshops will be offered for part of the regularly scheduled day, leaving the remainder of the day available for one-on-one sessions.  Workshops will be rotated so that popular topics are offered more than once.  

	One-on-one sessions will be scheduled directly with the counselor by the employee.  CRS will provide private office space and normal office equipment for individual counseling sessions.  

	Monthly workshops will coordinated with and scheduled by the COTR.  Topics for the monthly workshops will be approved in advance by the COTR.  CRS will provide for the reproduction of any materials and handouts for the workshops.  CRS will also provide a classroom.  Participants in the workshops will sign up in advance, with the contractor.  


Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be one working day per week, during normal business hours on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of each week through September 30, 2006.  


Place of Performance

	Work shall be performed at the Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave., SE, Washington, D.C., 20540.


Payment

	Payment will be made monthly upon submission of the contractor’s invoice and a report listing counseling days and workshops provided.  Payment may be expected within thirty days of receipt of certification by the COTR that all scheduled work has been completed in accordance with the terms and obligations of the statement of work.

Travel

Local travel will not be reimbursed by CRS.

Background Checks for Onsite Contractor Personnel

	Personnel provided under this contract shall not be under pending charges, shall have not
been convicted of any felony within the last 10years, or any misdemeanor within the last 5 years,
excepting minor motor vehicle infractions for which the individual paid a fine or posted collateral in the amount of $300 or less. Note that the term "convicted" would include a disposition of "probation" or "probation before judgment." Should any person employed by the contractor to perform work under this contract be convicted of any of the aforesaid offenses, the contractor agrees to remove the individual from the contract performance and return all Library building and stack passes issued to the individual. The contractor also agrees to remove from the contract performance any individual under pending charges for any felony or misdemeanor with the exceptions noted above until such time that the final disposition is known. Upon request of the Library, the contractor shall identify personnel to be assigned to work under the contract and submit a FD-258 (contractor 5 fingerprint chart) and any other necessary administrative forms provided by the Library so that a background check may be conducted. The parties agree that the Library has final authority to determine the suitability of contractor personnel who perform work under this contract.  Nevertheless, the fact that the Library may conduct background checks on assigned contractor personnel does not relieve the contractor of the responsibility to provide qualified, reliable personnel of sound character and conduct.

Confidentiality of Information

The Contractor shall not release, publish or otherwise disseminate any information received from CRS relating to or materials or products developed for CRS under this agreement without written authorization of the Director. The requests received by the Congressional Research Service from congressional offices and materials received in response to such requests are confidential and are not to be disseminated without prior authorization of the Director either during or after the period covered by this contract. 


Use of Congressional Research Service (CRS) Name or Contractual Relationships in Advertising

The Contractor agrees not to refer to awards from or contracts with the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or infer that the product or service provided is endorsed or preferred by CRS or is superior to other products or services.  The Contractor also agrees not to distribute or release any information that states or infers that CRS endorses, uses or distributes the Contractor's product or service.	

Evaluation Factors for Award 

	Award will be made to that offeror whose combination of factors represent the best value to the Government and is most advantageous, and which is within the available Library of Congress resources. 

	The technical factors in order of importance are: 

1.        Qualifications, credentials, and experience of contractor personnel proposed for the project: 

2. 	Technical Approach – understanding/responsiveness to the specific requirements: 

3. 	Experience providing the full array of career counseling services with a federal agency/organization, with references: 
4.	Cost: 

	Separate cost proposals will be submitted. All contractor expenses should be reflected in the cost proposal.

The first notice was posted November 29, 2004 and the second was posted February 2, 2005. The notices provided background to the NOAA GOES-R acquisition and suggested an RFP release date of March 15, 2005. Due to internal review scheduling conflicts, the GOES-R Program did not release the RFP on March 15, 2005. NOAA anticipates that the GOES-R RFP release date will be on or about March 22, 2005. 


NOAA’s GOES-R Program office provided the GOES-R PDRR Partial Draft RFP on December 30, 2004 and a full Draft RFP on January 28, 2005. These and other documents are available through the GOES-R Program web site http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/index.php. It was anticipated that the Program will release another Draft RFP March 15, 2005. While several of the documents have recently been updated, a full draft RFP will not be released at this time. We encourage interested parties to view the information posted to the GOES-R Program web site.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00032, which is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).    This requirement will be an unrestricted acquisition.  The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated to begin on or about January 3, 2006.  

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range shall be within a 30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.  The 30 minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

The proposed range must meet the following  standards to qualify for consideration:  

The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled .  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25- and 15-yard line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example:  wood).  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use. The range shall be equipped with men and womens restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide adequate parking to accommodate 15 vehicles and coincide with the location of cited above (30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport).  The range must possess an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board to accommodate 10 (ten) students.   The range must be able to accommodate the following calibers: 9mm, .40, and .357 (may be frangible) caliber ammunition.  The range rules must allow movement between firing points and will not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules will allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).   Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.    

	DHS personnel will use the range an average of 8 days per month with usage of 6 hours per day (equating to 48 hours per month). The estimated number of rounds fired is 350,000 per year.    The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in four hour blocks  from 0800 to 1800 hours, and blocks in the evening for night/low shooting.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there are may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of the weekend may be needed.  Should weather (i.e, rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.


	The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one –year options.  Offerors shall submit pricing for all range requirements.:

If range is outdoors, an inclement weather covering will be required nine months after award ensuring a dry shooting environment when it rains.
Offeror shall submit prices for months one through nine without an inclement weather covering.  Awardee must ensure the inclement weather covering is available by the beginning month 10 and pricing shall be submitted for months ten, eleven and twelve inclusive (of inclement weather covering).  Option year prices for terms one, two, three and four must be inclusive of the inclement weather covering requirements. 
For indoor or outdoor range, an operational turning target system which turns targets in less than one second will be required nine months after award.  Offeror shall submit prices for months one though nine without operational turning target system.  Awardee must ensure an operational turning target system will be available by the beginning of month 10 and pricing shall be submitted for  months ten, eleven and twelve inclusive (of operational turning target system).  Option year prices for terms one, two, three and four must be inclusive of an operational  turning target system.

Billing will be invoiced on a monthly basis.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Counterdrug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC), is soliciting white papers and proposals (technical and cost) for innovative research and development projects in counterdrug enforcement and support. The intent of this BAA is to identify and develop technologies that provide improvement in supply reduction capabilities, including the drug and contraband detection capabilities of federal (i.e., U.S. Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Immigration and Custom Enforcement, and Drug Enforcement Administration) and state and local Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). This BAA is focused generally on five major research and development (R&D) areas: 1. Methamphetamine laboratory detection. 2. Battery technology test and evaluation. 3. Low cost portable illicit drugs detection equipment. 4. Innovative surveillance system technologies. 5. Information management technologies. These five areas reflect the core interests of the CTAC Drug Supply Reduction capabilities improvement research and development program. Interest from other federal organizations, however, could be generated and selections could be made for funding by other than CTAC.  The mission of the CTAC is to serve as the central counterdrug technology research and development (R&D) organization of the U.S. Government. CTAC identifies and define the short, medium and long-term scientific and technological needs of the federal, state, and local drug agencies.  Within its mission, CTAC sponsors a counterdrug technology program to develop and deploy advanced technologies to improve national capabilities to reduce the supply of and demand for illicit drugs. The program includes: a) a technology research and development program to improve capabilities for interdicting drugs; and b) a Technology Transfer Program (TTP) to deploy technology to state and local law enforcement agencies for counterdrug missions.  Additional information on the programs within CTAC is available within the CTAC web site (http://www.whitehousedrugpolocy.gov/ctac).  Proposals for research and development that will support the mission of CTAC and its illicit drug supply reduction technology program will be considered under this BAA. Proposed efforts that offer new technologies and approaches that have the potential for significant improvement of current illicit drug supply reduction capabilities are specifically encouraged. Examples of areas that fall within CTAC supply reduction of illicit drugs mission and the scope this BAA include: · Methamphetamine Laboratory Detection. Characterization of residual waste remaining at clandestine methamphetamine laboratory sites and certification of inhibitors for anhydrous ammonia. · Battery Technology Test and Evaluation. Power supplies and conditioners that utilize batteries more efficiently, and battery technology test and evaluation that lead to more efficient utilization of available battery life. · Low Cost Portable Drug Detection Equipment. Handheld illicit drug detectors for roadside use and in situ testing of individual suspects. · Tracking and Surveillance Technologies.  Low probability of detection audio and video surveillance systems that operate under adverse conditions. Mapping and geolocation capabilities for monitoring the movements and activities of cooperative and non-cooperative targets. Advancements in tracking and surveillance support technologies such as information displays, image capture and image processing and basic critical components such as batteries and antennas. · Information Management technologies. Computer based tools for information gathering, management and storage, processing and retrieval; deep extraction of data; integration of existing systems in a modular format; data fusion; and operational applications while maintaining appropriate levels of security. This announcement will be open through 17 October 2006. To save preparation costs and other resources, offerors are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis/white paper. The white paper shall not exceed 10 pages. The body of the white paper shall include, as a minimum, a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. A cover sheet shall be included as the front page with the following information included (1) BAA number; (2) Primary technical area(s) (methamphetamine laboratory detection, battery test and evaluation technology, low cost portable illicit drug detection equipment, and/or surveillance system technologies) this submission is related to, (3) Lead Organization Submitting Proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," HBCU," "MI," OTHER EDUCATIONAL," or "OTHER NONPROFIT" (5) Contractor's reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include salutation, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available,), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available), total funds requested, and the amount of cost-share (if any); and preparation date.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend the ordering period and increase the maximum ordering value of the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract NAS5-01090, Mechanical Systems Engineering Services (MSES), for the Applied Engineering and Technical Directorate (AETD).   NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the services from Swales and Associates, Inc. on a sole source basis to allow continuation of the MSES contract until the follow-on competitive procurement is completed using the Source Evaluation Board (SEB) procedures.  This extension/increase to the MSES IDIQ contract will allow for the issuance of task order modifications and new work task orders up to six months (6) beyond the current ordering period of February 15, 2006. Due to the time constraints and the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, Swales and Associates, as the current incumbent, is the only responsible source qualified to perform this requirement due to its current involvement with complex systems and critical schedules of NASA flight programs such as HST, GOES, JWST, SDO, ST-5, etc.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 01, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Ultrasonic Phased Array Inspection System and Associated Phased Array Transducers, including a 32-channel focus unit; TomoView Software 2.2 for acquisition and analysis of data; 3, l0Mhz 64-element transducers; 1, 5Mhz 64-element transducer; custom water wedge; and operator's user manuals and guides.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from RD Tech Instruments, Inc., 48 Woerd Ave., Waltham, MA 02453 on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and its sister site, Michoud Assembly Facility (MAF) have been jointly using RD Tech Ultrasonic Phased Array systems for approximately five years.  MSFC and MAF have been working together to develop and implement an Ultrasonic Inspection method on the Space Shuttle's External Tank that would be capable of inspecting new types of weldments for detrimental flaws that conventional inspection technologies might overlook.  Over the past five years, NASA, Lockheed-Martin and RD Tech have worked together to develop an inspection technique that promises to significantly reduce overall inspection costs associated with the External Tank production.  NASA and Lockheed-Martin at MSFC have been sharing time on a single RD Tech Ultrasonic Phased Array Inspection System since this project began.  The acquisition of an additional Ultrasonic Phased Array Inspection System from RD Tech would allow for inspection techniques to be developed and improved upon concurrently by NASA and Lockheed-Martin at MSFC.  The proposed inspection system would be an exact duplicate of the existing RD Tech Ultrasonic Phased Array Inspection System currently being used on the External Tank Program, and would provide the continuity necessary to continue development on the inspection techniques discussed above.	In addition, the proposed inspection system could be used as a backup in the event of an inspection system failure so that work could continue.  Inspection data acquired by NASA and Lockheed-Martin at both MSFC and MAF are shared, evaluated, and discussed on a weekly basis to further develop the techniques. 2.  If a different Ultrasonic Phased Array Inspection System were to be acquired from another source, it would not provide the compatibility necessary for this project because it would not simulate and reproduce the same inspection data since the software for the proposed system is proprietary to RD Tech and cannot be obtained from any other source.  The use of different system from another source would render 5-year's worth of collected data unuseable. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 24, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>COMBAT RESCUE TANKER (CRT) COMBAT RESCUE TANKER MARKET RESEARCH Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and the Combat Rescue Tanker  (CRT) Integrated Product Team (IPT) are conducting advanced market  research looking for a new or modified tanker aircraft to replace or  augment the current fleet of fixed wing tankers that are used in the  combat search and rescue mission.  Candidate platform(s) will provide  Personnel Recovery/Recovery Operations (PR/RO) forces with the capability  to conduct in-flight and ground refueling of vertical lift assets, at a  minimum the HH-60 and V-22, and should have the capability to adapt to the  next generation (CSAR-X)  rescue platform.  It will also have the  capability to provide overt/covert airland or airdrop delivery of  Pararescuemen and their equipment.  In addition, the platform must have  the capability to perform the Airborne Mission Commander (AMC) mission. The platform must be capable of operating in 10 percent worldwide climatic  extremes as defined in MIL-HDBK-310., in all environmental regions of the  globe (e.g., arctic, desert, mountainous, littoral, tropical, etc.), day  or night, during adverse weather conditions, and in a variety of spectrums  of warfare to include passing through Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical  (NBC) environments.  The support and deployment concepts include the  capability to operate from main operating bases, forward operating bases,  and forward operating locations.   Onboard defensive capabilities must  permit the platform to operate in an increased threat environment.  The  platform must have an in-flight refueling capability from current  strategic tanker assets.  The platform must be capable of deploying  without immediate strategic airlift support and maintain sustained  operations with a minimum of support. The platform should be capable of refueling rotary wing and tiltrotor  (V-22) aircraft at airspeeds 105-180KEAS, and to incorporate a refueling  drogue that functions throughout that airspeed range without ground  reconfiguration.  It must also comply with Software Compliant Architecture  and Joint Tactical Radio Systems mandates, and also comply with  net-centric, airborne networking and IP networking architecture.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is set-aside for Small Business.  The National Guard Bureau (NGB) requires services for Family Assistance Centers for all deployed service members and their families in accordance with DoDI Number 1342.23, Family Readiness in the Nat ional Guard and Reserve Components, AR 600-20, Army Command Policy and FORSCOM Regulation 500-3, FORSCOM Mobilization and Deployment Planning.  The Family Assistance Center (FAC) is publicized as the primary entry point for service and assistance that any military family member may need during the deployment process.  The FACs are charged with preparing families for mobilizations, serving as the connection point between the chain of command and the chain of concern, providing assistance to families in prepa ring for and coping with all aspects of mobilization and deployment, to include parental/spousal separations and reunion activities.  The primary service provided by the FAC is information, referral, outreach and follow-up to ensure a satisfactory result.  Basic services provided include preparation of ID Cards and DEERS enrollment, assistance with TRICARE/TRICARE Dental, financial and legal Assistance, employment/re-employment, crisis intervention, and Family Readiness Group (FRG) support, liaison with com munity agencies and organizations and emergency services.   These FACs are strategically placed in each state and territory to overcome the geographic dispersion of both Active and Reserve Component families from centralized, installation based service pro viders.  From this baseline the ARNG can surge and relocate capacity and capability where needed.  The number of centers in each state/territory is based on deployments numbers.  As units return and a period of reintegration is completed, resources shift t o other areas throughout our Nation.  The National Guard Bureau (NGB) FAC contractor support, representing the National Guard Bureaus interests, through the Adjutants General offices, to the state and territory State Family Program Directors (SFPDs), shal l provide information, referral, outreach, and support services to members and their families for all services and components per FORSCOM guidelines.  Performance of each contractor employee must be within guidelines of stated regulations. The standard exp ectation for response to family member issues shall be 24hrs with a resolution or follow-up contact.   The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of m inor clarification).  The Government will select the firm that represents the best overall value on the basis of the following five (5) evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance: (a) Technical Expertise & Experience; (b) Management Plan;  (c) Personnel/Staffing Plan; (d) Past Performance; and (e) Cost.  The resultant contract will be a single award, Fixed Price Level-Of-Effort contract with a one-year base period and four option years.  It is anticipated the solicitation and any amendments  will be issued on or about 1 November 2005 in electronic format with firms being responsible for receipt.  The closing date for receipt of technical and cost proposal will be on or about 1 December 2005.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking proposals from sources interested in submitting an offer to provide Geostationary operational Satellite, series R (GOES-R) Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) services.  

Previously, a FedBizOpps notice was posted on 29 Nov 2004 (Reference-Number-NE-EK0000-5-00033) asking for acquisition strategy recommendation white papers from industry and announcing an Industry Day for 13 Dec 2004. That Industry Day was held, and documents resulting from that event are found at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/.     Subsequently, and as discussed at that event, a partial draft RFP for the GOES-R PDRR effort was released for industry recommendations on 30 Dec 2004, and a more complete draft RFP (RFP No. DG133E-05-RP-1034) was released on 28 Jan 2005 (with recommendations due to the Government by 17 Feb 2005). All of these documents are available at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/.     

At this time, the Government has finalized the RFP including all exhibits and attachments, and is posting it herewith.  (RFP No. DG133E-05-RP-1034).  The finalized RFP and all exhibits/attachments are also available at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/index.php.  Up to three, Firm Fixed Price awards are contemplated.  Each award will reflect a 6 month basic effort to conduct work leading up to a System Requirements Review (SRR).  The awards will also contain an option to acquire an additional 6-months of services leading up to a System Concept Review (SCR), and another option for an additional 10-months of services culminating with the conduct of an Interim Preliminary Design Review (IPDR).  The combined total period of performance, if all options are exercised, will be 22 months.  All responsible sources are invited to submit an offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the RFP.

The Contractor shall be responsible for performing an appraisal of the physical condition of each vehicle returned by the Government, prior to that vehicle being released from the Government’s custody, and shall furnish the Government with a copy of the appraisal upon it’s completion.  The Government shall not be responsible for any damage not listed on the appraisal report. The Government will assume full responsibility for reconditioning the vehicles at it’s expense, excluding normal wear and tear as defined below .  For purposes of this contract lease, “normal wear and tear” is defined as those dents, dings, paint chips, scratches, pitted but not cracked windshields, and interior wear such as soiled carpets and seats, normally occurring to a motor vehicle over the contract period of use, in both a rural and metropolitan area.

EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this Request of Quotation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the Request for Quotation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (1) Past Performance; (2) Technical specifications; and (3) Price.  Technical and past performance, when combined are more important than price. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic year.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  PAST PERFORMANCE: The Offeror shall demonstrate successful past performance in performing work that is similar in size and scope to this procurement.  The Offeror shall submit all contracts performed during the past five years similar in size and scope to this procurement. This shall be done by describing current and past work of a similar or identical nature in such a manner that an evaluation can be made of the performance history and the relevance of this experience to the requirements of the solicitation.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement

NOTE:  The NAIC Code for this Sources Sought is changed from 541990 to 541710.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Chemical and Biological (CB) Defense Science and Technology (S&T) Program is seeking interested sources capable of innovative or novel capabilities in multiple disciplines including materials science, computer science, chemistry, biology, medical research and systems engineering.  To satisfy these requirements, for the first time in its history, DTRA anticipates the use of Other Transactions to reach sources that do not traditionally respond to Government solicitations.  It is also anticipated that traditional sources and traditional contracts, grants and cooperative agreements may be used. DTRA plans to release a draft Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on or about November 15, 2005 and a final BAA in late February 2006.  
Research activities within the CB Defense S&T Program fall into the following categories:

o     Medical science and technology programs look at pretreatments (i.e., vaccines) diagnostics, therapeutics to counter both existing and emerging threats;
 
o     Physical Science and Applied Technology programs focusing on Collection, Detection, Protection, Decontamination, Modeling & Simulation, and Support Science & Technology; and 

o     Technology Transition Programs focus on Transition Planning, War-fighter Enhancement, Test and Evaluation, and Homeland Defense.

DTRA is seeking those organizations with the capability to identify, seek and establish relationships with non-traditional and traditional entities capable of providing required solutions or technologies to support the CB Defense and S&T Programs over the next five years.  Flexible organizations and organizational structures are a must, to adapt to the changing CB S&T environment.  DTRA will consider all possible relationships proposed by offerors that provide a flexible, commercially compatible agreement that facilitates basic and applied research, and prototype development, demonstration, and evaluation for commercial applications and technologies.  Potential sources having the capability necessary to assist the CB Defense S&T Program in identifying and pursuing the above services are invited to provide information demonstrating their capabilities.  
Information submitted should demonstrate the firm’s capability to reach the largest pool of traditional and/or non-traditional defense contractors in the areas identified above, and clearly identify the methods used to obtain sources, technologies, products and services related to CB Defense S&T.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status, if applicable, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  It is requested that capability statements be in PDF Format and be limited to five (5) pages in length.  This is a request for information for planning purposes.

DTRA plans to hold an initial Industry Day on or about December 15, 2005 for interested parties.

Information regarding where and when to submit capability statements will be posted to this website:

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services Acquisition and Procurement Office (WHS/A&PO) in support of the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA) requires Security Services for the Pentagon Reservation and other DoD buildings and facilities under PFPAâ€™s purview in and around the National Capital Region (NCR) as replacement and/or follow-on contracts for those currently in place. 

AMENDMENT:
The solicitation documents are nearing final completion and will be released soon; in the interim WHS/A&PO provides additional information to help your firm prepare a proposal(s) for these requirements.  

A pre-proposal conference is tentatively planned for late November; release of the draft RFP will precede the pre-proposal conference; conference details will be stated in the draft RFP. 

NEW INFORMATION: Offerors must be capable of obtaining all licenses, certifications and bonding that is required by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Although the Pentagon Reservation is designated Federal property, the other facilities covered by this requirement are leased office space located within the Commonwealth of Virginia. To conduct operations at those facilities, the successful offerors must meet the Commonwealth of Virginia standards for security service providers. 
Contractor security officer personnel must all be able to obtain a Secret Security clearance.  In the event of elevated threat conditions contractor security officer personnel can expect to receive classified (maximum of Secret level) briefings pertaining to responding to potential situations. Procedures for obtaining the required clearances will be stated in the solicitation. 
The contractor shall hold, at a minimum, an interim secret facility clearance as granted by Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) before the award date and at least 30-days prior to the contract start-up date. Interim secret facility clearances are granted by DISCO subsequent to the final secret clearance.

Offerors who are considered for receipt of more than one contract or a contract for more than one location shall be prepared to show a staffing plan, employee commitment contracts, and a retention and recruitment plan that convinces the acquisition team of the offerorâ€™s capability to provide and maintain quality professional security services for complete, simultaneous coverage of the posts as well as additional surge support for ALL the locations that the offeror is proposing to manage.

OLD INFORMATION:
In accordance with DoD guidance, the new contracts will be performance-based contracts which places the responsibility for management, quality control and successful performance of the work exclusively on the contractor; the contract(s) will provide for scheduled and unscheduled formal evaluations by Government personnel to document performance successes or shortfalls as measured against standards established and incorporated in the contract and to ensure that positive and negative incentives are applied in an equitable and timely manner in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. 

The Government intends to issue one solicitation and award no more than five separate firm fixed price contracts.  The contracts will each have a geographical designation for various locations within the NCR. The Period of Performance for each contract will be a base period of 12 months with two (2) option periods and with the opportunity to earn additional option periods for documented superior performance of security services. The estimated dollar magnitude for each geographical designation is between $23 and $33 Million for the entire period of performance including all option periods. The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 561612 (annual size standard is $10.5 Million).  All five contracts are set aside 100% for small business.  A contractor may receive more than one award, however the Government reserves the right to limit the number of awards to any individual contractor based on the Governmentâ€™s assessment of the offerorâ€™s capability and capacity to manage and perform multiple contracts at multiple locations. 

The Government will entertain innovative business affiliations such as joint ventures, SBA approved mentor-protÃ©gÃ© arrangements, partnerships, teaming, subcontracting, and other business arrangements that enhance the offerorâ€™s capability to successfully meet the requirements of the solicitation while increasing the Governmentâ€™s confidence level in the ability of the offeror to perform the requirements of the work statement with minimal risk of non-performance.  

The Government requires world class providers of security services that can demonstrate the following: a proven track record of verifiable experience in performing similar and relevant projects or contracts of like magnitude; rigorous management practices and controls, including a robust quality control plan and program that ensures the highest quality service; an effective, documented safety program and a record of superior past performance on contracts of similar complexity and magnitude to assure the Government of the firmâ€™s ability to deliver the most professional and reliable service possible. 

The offeror(s) shall provide all management, supervision, labor, and material/equipment (except that specified as Government Furnished) necessary to provide security services in support of PFPAâ€™s mission. The basic mission is to provide security of assigned facilities and to ensure a safe environment for all personnel including DoD/WHS employees, official guests and visitors within the assigned buildings and facilities. Some of the tasks associated with these contracts include: preventing unauthorized access to facilities; maintaining order in assigned buildings; deterring, recording and reporting criminal activity in and around all assigned DoD/WHS controlled facilities; access control (ID check); foot/area patrols; building and grounds security; and safeguarding classified Government information and materials located at DoD/WHS owned, leased, or controlled facilities throughout the Pentagon Reservation and the NCR.  This requirement includes the services of both armed and unarmed security officers; all officers will be required to obtain Security Clearances. Potential offerors are notified that physical examinations and drug testing of all security officers are required in accordance with PFPA rules and regulations. 


This requirement is being solicited in accordance with FAR Part 12 â€“ Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15 â€“ Contracting by Negotiation.  FAR Part 15 Source Selection procedures will be used to determine the Best Value solution to providing these services. Anticipated Evaluation Factors are: Management and Technical Approach, to include the offerorâ€™s Quality Control plan and program; Past Performance; and Price. 

The solicitation will be published on the FedBizOpps website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ in the near future. A pre-proposal conference will be held within ten working days after publication of the solicitation.  Detailed information about the pre-proposal conference will be available as soon as the solicitation is published.

<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Forecast Systems Lab (FSL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Geodetics, Inc, 565 Pearl St. suite 108, La Jolla, CA  92037 to provide GPS data processing software. FSL has been tasked to develop, test and evaluate the impact of correction parameters derived NOAA tropospheric and space weather prediction models on GPS positioning and navigation accuracy. The empirical methodology being used to evaluate the impact of atmospheric correctors on differential GPS accuracy requires FSL to continuously monitor the positions of stations in a network of GPS sites, and evaluate the impact that various combinations of models make on single epoch position solutions. Only Geodetics produces a package with the characteristics required. The Geodetics RTD (Real Time Dynamics) provides three-dimensional precise instantaneous GPS positioning of wide-area networks of static, deforming and dynamic GPS receivers. RTD contains Geodetics' proprietary RNA (Rapid Network Analysis) module with Epock-byEpoch (Trademark) technology. This technology provides an independent estimate of network position and per-site zenith tropospheric delays (the parameter produced by our model) at each epoch of dual-frequency (L1 and L2) observations of five or more GPS satellites. The most important feature of RTD is that it is capable, without modifications, of accepting a priori estimates of zenith delays and their uncertainties for external sources such as a real time atmospheric delay models. The software is especially designed for extremely fast real-time data streaming and processing of GPS data on standard PC workstations and allows execution of simultaneous instances of the application on a single workstation. These features make it ideal for rapid evaluation of external atmospheric models.  

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This synopsis is issued for information purposes. Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any source that believes it can supply this requirement should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements, within 15 days of this notice.  Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail. Anticipated award date will be November 3, 2005

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE; there is no solicitation available at this time.  No response will be provided for requests for a solicitation.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS PUBLISHED FOR INFORMATION PLANNING PERPOSES ONLY. 

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA/NTD) seeks potential sources for the development of nuclear radiation detectors for gamma spectroscopy that can operate in diverse field environments without the logistic burden of cryogenic fluids or excessive power sources. It is essential that these gamma spectrometers provide the very high resolution currently obtainable utilizing liquid-nitrogen-cooled high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors when operated by adequately trained personnel with non-technical backgrounds. These gamma spectrometers must be operable using battery-based power systems and be able to identify all radionuclides in elemental mixtures, particularly when said mixtures occur in naturally occurring radiation materials (NORM) and when radionuclides have been purposely included into a mixture for masking purposes. These detector systems must be capable of providing data through standard network and communications protocols in a format usable by adequately trained non-technical operators. The transmission of gamma spectra by wireless means is also desired. Integral neutron detection is also desired.

Sources sought responses shall reflect corporate information and a capability summary reflecting experience related to the above areas.  Responses are to be limited to no more than five pages.  Company information should include qualifications and experience in work of this nature, point of contact, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, CAGE code, DUNS Number, business size, and small business classification (8(a), HUB Zone, etc.), if applicable.  Any information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice is strictly voluntary.  This synopsis is for information planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.   

Responses shall be submitted no later than 2:00pm EST on 11 NOV 2005.  Electronic responses are recommended and encouraged, and shall be submitted to Mr. Jonathan Becker at jonathan.becker@dtra.mil.  Non-electronic responses, though not preferred, may be submitted via facsimile to 703.325.9294 to the attention of Mr. Jonathan Becker. All documentation shall become the property of the Government.  

Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional information is available.  Requests for the same will be disregarded.  There is no commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, to make award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties in support of any effort in response to this Sources Sought Notice.  Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit or award a contract.
