<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-13  Underwater Express Program; CLOSING DATE:  12:00 Noon, February 1, 2007; FULL PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS:  12:00 Noon, February 1, 2006; local Arlington, VA time.  POC:  Khine Latt, DARPA/ATO; Email: BAA06-13@darpa.mil;  Web:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/underwaterexpress/index.htm

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Underwater Express Program to demonstrate stable and controllable high-speed underwater transport through supercavitation.  The intent is to determine the feasibility for supercavitation technology to enable a new class of high-speed underwater craft for future littoral missions that could involve the transport of high-value cargo and/or small units of personnel.  The Underwater Express program is a technology development and demonstration program:  It will require the investigation and resolution of critical technological issues associated with the physics of supercavitation and must culminate in a credible demonstration at a significant scale to prove that a supercavitating underwater craft is controllable at speeds up to 100 knots.  

Through this program, DARPA is seeking to facilitate new operational opportunities in the underwater battlespace.  Also relevant are the current limitations for small high-speed surface craft which suffer performance degradation in waves and are subject to exposure, while underwater alternatives today are very slow.  The military advantage of very high speed underwater craft has yet to be exploited to its full potential because significant technological breakthroughs are needed for operational viability of such a craft.  The ability to attain substantial underwater speeds for this class of vehicle is severely constrained by the power required to overcome the large drag forces on an underwater body.  Without a radical means to solve this problem, strides that could be made in underwater propulsion are limited, as are breakthroughs needed in underwater sensing, navigation, and communications, all critical to taking strategic advantage of the underwater space.   

Supercavitation offers 60-70% reduction in total drag on an underwater body.  It can be attained by going fast enough to develop a full vaporous cavity, or it can be induced at lower speeds by injecting gas into a partially-developed cavity.  Although the technology has been applied to weapons with minimal control capability, its application to larger vessels with transport missions will require thorough development.  Our goal is to achieve tractable management and control of the dynamics of a supercavitating underwater body so that an eventual system, manned or unmanned, could be envisioned to travel in this state.   

DARPA is interested in proposals that will advance the understanding and use of supercavitation technology through research and development, small-scale experimentation, and a final at-sea demonstration.  The Underwater Express final demonstration will be conducted at ¼ to ½ scale of a notional future craft of about 8-ft diameter and 60 tonnes, a ‘super-fast submerged transport’ (SST) craft.  The ability to generate and maintain the large cavity needed for this scale vehicle has never been demonstrated, nor has a control system for maneuvering the vehicle.  Therefore, this program will emphasize:

1.  Modeling, simulation, and experimentation to provide better physical understanding of cavity formation, stability, and control; 
2.  Cavitator designs that generate stable, robust, and controllable cavities;
3.  Prediction of cavity dynamics and vehicle behavior, prediction of vehicle behavior during fully-wetted conditions, transition to supercavitation conditions, and supercavitation conditions at speed;
4.  Control system technologies that enable maneuverability when supercavitating;
5.  A system concept, preliminary design, and requirements documentation for the notional SST craft.

The technologies will be first developed and proven at subscales.  After demonstrations show the technology to be viable and technically sound, the technology will be scaled up to the next level.  

Phase 1 will focus on stable cavity generation and sustainment by examining supercavitation physics and the interactions between the cavity and body.  During Phase 1, a system concept for the 8-ft diameter notional SST system will be developed so that appropriate scale models can be designed for Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing and the Phase 3 demonstration (at ¼ to ½ scale of the notional SST).  In addition, an initial concept design of a control system for all vehicle operating conditions is necessary.  

Phase 2 will focus on stable vehicle dynamics by continuing to examine supercavitation physics and cavity/vehicle interactions and developing the vehicle control approach.  The propulsion concept will be integrated.  In this phase, maneuvering and body forces will be characterized and measured, as will gas expenditures.  Phase 2 will also continue to develop the SST system concept.  

Phase 3 will focus on design and fabrication of the demonstrator and system testing to ensure safe and effective operations.  It will end with the at-sea demonstration of maneuvering at 100 knots for 10 minutes.  Additionally, the final system specifications for the full-scale SST notional concept craft will be completed.

Potential bidders should include team members with expertise in vehicle system integration, vehicle control, supercavitation (or cavitation), cavity ventilation, underwater propulsion, and computational modeling.

This BAA shall remain open for one (1) year from the date of publication on www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov.  Although the Government may select proposals for award at any time during this period, it is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the initial selections.  Proposers may submit a full proposal in accordance with the instructions provided in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) at any time up to the proposal due date.  In order to be considered during the initial round of funding, full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn: BAA06-13) on or before 12:00 Noon, February 1, 2006 Eastern Standard Time.  

The Government encourages proposals from non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI, small business, or small disadvantaged business participation due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiations. 

PROPOSERS’ DAY:  DARPA will host a Proposers’ Day in support of the BAA06-13, Underwater Express Program, on 16 December, 2005 at the Executive Conference Center, 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 600, Arlington, VA  22201 beginning at 8:00 am and lasting until 3:00 pm.  The purpose of this event is to provide information on the Underwater Express Program, promote additional discussion on this topic, and address questions from potential proposers.  

The Proposers’ Day will be unclassified NOFORN and will include a classified session at the SECRET level.  Attendance is limited to U.S. citizens only, and attendance at the classified session will require an active collateral SECRET clearance.  The Underwater Express Program will be subject to U.S. Export Controls (International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) and National Security regulations.  All performers must meet the requirements for participation set by those regulations.  The Proposers’ Day is voluntary.  Attendance is not required to propose to this BAA.  No registration fee is required for this event.  Additional information is available through the Underwater Express website:  http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/underwaterexpress/index.htm.

Those who wish to attend this event must register NLT December 9, 2005 at the following website: https://enstg.com/Signup/default.cfm?ThisCode=UND63154.  

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this project are: (a) Technical Approach; (b) Experience in Developing Underwater Systems; (c) Management Approach; (d) Potential Contribution to the DARPA Mission, and (e) Cost Reasonableness and Realism.  Each proposal will be evaluated on the merit and relevance of the specific proposal as it relates to the program rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area, since no common work statement exists.

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated PIP available at www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov, which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

It is the policy of BSA to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  BSA is interested in receiving innovative proposals that offer potential for advancement and improvement in the engineering design study for the PHENIX Silicon Vertex detector (VTX).  The successful offeror will be required to perform an engineering design study of components of the Silicon Vertex Detector (VTX) for the PHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The VTX is a compact device, approximately cylindrical in shape with an outer radius of 20 cm and a length of 80 cm. The VTX has three main components, a central barrel containing four layers of silicon sensors (both silicon strips and pixels) with approximately 4.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics plus two end caps with four strip layers each and approximately 1.3 million sensor channels and associated electronics.   The frames supporting the VTX sensors and electronics must be low mass and low density, composed primarily of carbon composite materials to allow a maximum 100 micron deflection under gravity of any component of the VTX mechanical system. The VTX must have an associated cooling system that is capable of removing up to 150 Watts of heat from the device. Together the mechanical and cooling system must add no more than 1.4% to the total mass of the detector. The company performing this job must have experience working with large channel count, silicon sensor detector systems for particle physics and space-based experiments. They must have a demonstrated track-record of design of mechanical support, cooling and alignment systems with micron-level precision and multi-project experience designing and prototyping carbon composite-based low mass mechanical support systems. The company must also have significant experience working on advanced technology mechanical engineering projects for the US Department of Energy and NASA. 

Tasks to be performed:
1) Barrel Ladder Staves
•	R&D: Perform FEA modal analysis to determine the dynamic stiffness of the lay-up. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than 100 microns of gravitational sag. Optimize for mass (low Z) and structural integrity. An analysis will be performed to determine if mounting the staves only at the end of the VTX is acceptable.
•	Design:   Design the staves to be similar in concept to those used by silicon vertex detectors of the equivalent complexity in recent particle physics or spaced-based experiments. Design the connection between the ladders and the barrel mounts.

2) Ladder Coolant Tubes plus Terminations
•	R&D: A thermal analysis will be performed to size the ladder coolant tubes and to determine suitable connectors.
•	Design: Design the routing of the coolant lines inside the VTX detector.

3)Barrel Mounts
•	R&D: Perform FEA modal analyses to determine dynamic stiffness. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than100 micron of gravity sag. Optimize for mass (low Z), structural integrity and access.
•	Design: The cant angle and overlap specifications for precise positioning of the ladders will be incorporated into the design of the barrel mounts. The connection between the barrel mounts and the space frame will be designed. It will be determined how to precisely position the barrels through an adjustment feature.

4)Space Frame:
•	R&D: The VTX space frame design should use a kinematic mounting technique with analysis similar to that used on silicon vertex detectors of the equivalent complexity in recent particle physics or spaced-based experiments. Perform FEA modal analyses to determine dynamic stiffness. Perform FEA for mass-loaded static stiffness to insure less than 100 micron gravity sag. Optimize for mass (low Z), structural integrity and access. Optimize the location and shape of mass reducing cutouts in consultation with Los Alamos National Laboratory project engineers.
•	Design: Design a carbon-composite structure, octagonal in shape. Use stiffening sandwich structure end plates. Determine the best method for connecting the two space frame clamshell halves.

FNAL was founded in 1967 and is a single program laboratory funded by the DOE Office of Scienceâ€™s Office of High Energy Physics. Fermilabâ€™s mission is to advance the understanding of the fundamental nature of matter and energy by providing leadership and resources for qualified researchers to conduct research at the frontiers of high-energy physics and related disciplines.  To carry this out, Fermilab has a staff of approximately 2,000 employees and an annual budget of about $315 million.  It operates the worldâ€™s highest energy particle accelerator, the Tevatron, on a 6,800-acre site.  Approximately 2,500 scientists from 230 universities and laboratories in 35 states and 30 countries carry out research at the â€œenergy frontier,â€ the highest energy environment for discovery of particle physics in the world today.  Fermilab scientists also pursue research in particle astrophysics and cosmology, exploring the convergence of the inner space of the tiniest elementary particles, and the outer space of the structure and evolution of the universe. Fermilab operates the following user facilities: â€¢  The Tevatron, the worldâ€™s highest energy particle accelerator. The Tevatron creates millions of high-energy proton-antiproton collisions per second to allow physicists to study the smallest things human beings have ever detected and their relationship to the evolution and structure of the universe. â€¢  MiniBooNE, a neutrino oscillation experiment. MiniBooNEâ€™s results will provide a stringent test of the Standard Model view of neutrino physics. â€¢  NuMI/MINOS, a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The MINOS neutrino detectors include a far detector located 400 miles away in the Soudan Iron Mine, half a mile underground in northern Minnesota, and a near detector located at Fermilab.  It uses a beam of neutrinos (NuMi) from Fermilab to study the phenomenon of neutrino mass. In addition, Fermilab is the host laboratory for US/CMS, the U.S. section of the Compact Muon Solenoid Collaboration that will build and operate one of two large detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  Fermilab is also the host laboratory for the U.S. efforts building components for the LHC and the U.S. accelerator R&D program with the LHC.  When the LHC begins operations later this decade, experiments at the new energy frontier will provide profound new insight into the mystery of why particles have mass. Anticipated funding (from all sources) for fiscal year 2006 for FNAL is approximately $315 million.  DOE expects to award a new performance-based contract during the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 and will include a two month transition period.  All interested parties are requested to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) to Tonja Stokes, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, RFP Number DE-RP02-06CH11359 at the following e-mail address: tonja.stokes@ch.doe.gov.  While there is no specific format required, please reference the RFP number, list the name of a contact with a telephone number and an e-mail address, indicate your interest as being either a prime or a subcontractor, indicate whether you are a small business, and indicate if you are willing to have your expression of interest information published on the Source Evaluation Boardâ€™s solicitation website.  Submission of an EOI does not commit an interested party to submit a proposal, nor does failure to submit an EOI preclude an interested party from submitting a proposal.  Expressions of Interest should be received no later than 3:00 pm Central Standard Time on December 23, 2005. Future information regarding this solicitation will be posted on DOEâ€™s Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) at URL http://e-center.doe.gov and/or the RFP website at URL http://rfpfnal.sc.doe.gov.  Offerors are responsible for frequently checking IIPS and the RFP website for information, notices, and updates regarding the solicitation.  Offerors are advised of a SUBCRIBE feature on the website, which will allow interested parties to subscribe for automatic receipt of notice(s) regarding updates that are made to the RFP website. DOE anticipates issuing a draft RFP in the second quarter of FY06. Points of Contact Robert Gordon, Contracting Officer, (631) 344-3346, rgordon@bnl.gov; Tonja Stokes, Source Evaluation Board Executive Secretary, (630) 252-2136, tonja.stokes@ch.doe.gov.

<CONTACT>Dale Wilkerson Contracting Officer 6626804009     dale_wilkerson@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service is seeking contractors to remove vegetative fuel accumulations in support of the national Wildland Urban Interface hazardous fuels reduction program on the Natchez Trace Parkway.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is 450-miles long, and runs from Natchez, Mississippi to Nashville, Tennessee.  Over the past several years there has been an accumulation of downed limbs, trees, brush, etc. in many locations along the Parkway.  This material has become "vegetative fuel," capable of feeding wildfires.  Since the Parkway runs adjacent to non-federal lands, both developed and undeveloped, the threat of private property loss should a fire erupt is potentially very great.  Therefore, the purpose of this contract is to mitigate the vegetative fuel accumulation in the identified project areas to lessen the risk of losses due to wildfire, and to remove concentrations of damaged and dead vegetative fuels as a preventative measure.  The contractor(s) will be required to remove all dead and downed woody material and either haul away to an approved disposal site or chip smaller debris.  No standing trees will be cut and stump removal is not a part of this project.  There are three project areas included in this contract and contractors may bid on any or all of the three areas.  Note that multiple awards may result from this solicitation.  Project Area #1 is located near Ridgeland Mississippi in Madison County, with approx. 38 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $50,000 to $100,000.  Project Area #2 is located near Tupelo Mississippi in Lee County, with approx. 87 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude between $100,000 to $150,000.  Project Area #3 is also located near Tupelo Mississippi in Lee county, with approx. 104 acres requiring treatment at an estimated magnitude of $150,000 to $200,000.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside being conducted as an Invitation for Bids.  The applicable NAICS code is 113310 with an associated size standard of 500 employees.  This notice is not the solicitation.  The solicitation package will be available on or about December 14, 2005 and will be issued as an IFB electronically on the Department of Interior's National Business Center (NBC) web site, at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available.  Bidders desiring to conduct business with DOI are requested to register at the National Business Center.

<DESC>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 335313.  The Port Hueneme Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center intends to issue a request for quotation to L3 Communications, Power Systems Group (PSG), 901 E. Ball Road, Anaheim, CA, 92805-5916.  The request for proposal shall be on a sole source basis for the procurement of Ordnance Alteration (O/A) kits 20324, 20375 and 20328 for the AEGIS Training and Readiness Center (ATRC) (Dahlgren, VA) and Goddard Space Flight Center (SCSC) (Wallops Island, VA).  This requirement also includes the installation of O/A 20375 at ATRC and SCSC and installation of O/A 20368 at ATRC.    The anticipated services will be provided on a Firm Fixed Priced contract. L3 Communications, Power Systems Group is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and is the only source for the O/A 20368 kits.  Drawings are owned by PSG and it would not be economical for any manufacturer to buy the drawings from PSG and manufacture kits for a lower price.  As the OEM, PSG designed and developed the MK 84 and the ACSSFC.  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEASYSCOM) assigned PSG as the sole design agent for 400Hz system since the introduction to the U.S. Navy.  As the assigned design agent and producer, PSG has custody of the operational MK 84 and ACSSFC Land Based Test Units for design and test purposes.  Due to the complexity of the O/A, PSG is the only firm possessing the in-depth technical knowledge, experience and capabilities required to complete a successful installation and the only source capable of manufacturing the O/A kits and providing field service engineering expertise to meet the FY06 installation schedule.  Notes 12, 22, and 26 apply.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate on a sole basis with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 W 42nd Street, New York, New York  10036 pursuant to the statutory authority of 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   This procurement shall be processed in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Contractor shall serve as the Secretariat for International Secretariat for the International Organization for Standardization/International/ Electrotechnical Commission Joint Technical Committee 1 on Information Technology, Subcommittee 17 on Cards and Personal Identification, Work Group 4, Task Force 9 on Smartcard Interoperability (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17/WG 4/Task Force 9).   

Rapid Smartcard standardization is critical to accelerate deployment of standards-based security solutions for Homeland Security applications within our Nation's critical infrastructure.  ANSI, and no other entity, is particularly suited to provide Secretariat services for the following reasons:

Since the inception of JTC 1 in 1987, ANSI has served as the Secretariat responsible for the development and maintenance of the JTC 1 Directives, and advisory services for JTC 1 procedure.  As the JTC 1 Secretariat, ANSI possesses the necessary position, authority, and competence to accelerate international identification and Smartcard standardization through its experience with the National Bodies involved in international identification related standardization activities.  
ANSI possesses unique, detailed knowledge and perspective of the directives due to its responsibility to process and incorporate all changes for every new edition of the JTC 1 Directives.  Knowledge of  JTC 1 procedures are required to ensure the acceleration of international Smartcard  standardization. 
The Government is unaware of any other source from which these services can be obtained.  Award to other than the ANSI is not expected result in a satisfactory substitute and would result in substantial duplication of time and costs that cannot be expected to be recovered through competition.  The NAICS Code is 519190 and the size standard is 46M.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.     However, if any interested party believes it can meet the requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.     The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIST to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 3:30 EST, December 5, 2005.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.     Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Tonya Anderson, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)435-2238, Fax (301)402-5687, Email tanders@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions Branch under the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions, intends to negotiate on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) on a sole source basis, under authority U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, with Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland to provide support to the NINDS Section on Stroke Diagnostics and Therapeutics (NINDS Stroke Team).  Suburban Hospital will provide the services of an acute care hospital supporting the ongoing research of the NINDS Stroke Team.  Although Suburban Hospital will not be conducting any of the research under this program, they will be providing support services in the form of patient identification and referral; MRI technologist support for MRI imaging of prospective patients for recruitment; nursing support; neuroradiology support; emergency preparation and blinding of study drugs by a hospital pharmacist; chemistry and hematological laboratory tests required by the NINDS research protocols; neurointensive care and monitoring of patients enrolled under the NINDS Stroke Team, and 24/7 access to a state-of-the-art MRI facility for acute stroke patients.  The MRI facility has two MRI scanners and is located in close proximity to the Emergency Department.  The MRI scanners have advanced stroke and cardiac imaging capabilities and are made available to NINDS Stroke Team within 15 minutes of request.    

Since the goal of this program is to evaluate acutely ill patients, the proximity of the acute care hospital with a state-of-the-art MRI facility to NIH is critical to permit NIH clinical staff to respond to acute stroke patient issues in a timely fashion from NIH site.  Based on the clinical requirements of the acute stroke patient, the hospital must be located within 5 minutes driving time or 10 minutes by foot from the NIH, Bethesda, MD campus.   NINDS currently has six active research protocols established at Suburban Hospital (Protocol Nos. 05-N-0036, 04-N-0264, 03-N-0171, 02-N-0301 02-N-0154, 01-N-0007).  Recruitment for these studies is active and ongoing.  NIH has purchased a 100% ownership of one state-of-the art MRI scanner with advanced cardiac imaging at Suburban Hospital and a 20% ownership of a second state-of-the art MRI scanner with advanced stroke imaging. Based on the above, the Government has determined that Suburban Hospital is the only source that can continue to provide the necessary resources that support this ongoing research by virtue of their 10 plus years of past and current work experience.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays that would result in competing these services in an attempt to see if another source could provide or even achieve or attain the level of performance that is required and provided by the current source, make competition for any continuation of services unfeasible.  Any down-time created by the potential for competition would result in a loss in a large investment that has been already made in the performance of this program.   This contract is being solicited on a cost reimbursement basis, with a base period of twelve months with four (4) one-year options.  All inquiries may be sent to Susan Nsangou, Contracting Officer, on 301 443 2104 or nsangous@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Andrew Chappell, (703) 325-4993
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W909MY-06-R-0001, soliciting full proposals for Autonomous Mine Detection Sensors (AMDS) Technology has been posted to the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.  This BAA; spon sored by the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD); is open for submission of proposals through 12 January 2006, at 12:00 noon.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) and paragraph 35.016 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) which provides for competitive selection of research and development proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  Accordingly, proposals selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and fully compliant with PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. Prospective offerors should note that this BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make an award or pay proposal preparation costs generated in response to this announcement.  The cost of proposal preparation for respons e to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract.  However, it may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.  Funds are not presently available fo r the research interests represented in this BAA.  No contract award will be made unless appropriated funds are available for payment of the effort being acquired.  Prospective offerors are reminded that only a duly warranted Contracting Officer may obliga te the Government.  Any resultant contract award would include all clauses required by Federal Acquisition Regulations and appropriate supplements. The NVESD Countermine Division is searching for technology approaches capable of detecting anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) mines at a minimum distance of 10m (measured horizontally) in front of the detection sensor. The minimum requirement is 10m st andoff from the operator and the goal is 10m standoff from the sensor.  The countermine payload, including but not limited to the sensor(s), mounting hardware, and on-board processors, must be compatible with a small autonomous robotic platform (to be prov ided as Government Furnished Equipment). The goals for size and weight are 10 pounds and 10 watts. The objective of this BAA is to evaluate and demonstrate approaches for autonomous mine detection of anti-personnel (AP) and anti-tank (AT) mines from a small robotic platform.  Full proposals are requested for up to two-year technology development contrac ts from those companies whose proposed approach successfully meets the stated performance criteria.  Previously, Phase II of the AMDS program established the capability to detect typical AP and AT land mines with a probability of detection (PD) of 0.98 and  a probability of false alarm (pfa) of 0.2 (The Pd is the fraction of the encountered mines that are detected, and the Pfa is the number of clutter items declared to be mines divided by the total number of clutter items.).  Pd, and Pfa will be measured aga inst like subsets of targets (e.g., AP or AT mines).  Phase III of this program will build on the success of the previous phase.  The goal will be to further reduce the pfa while maintaining or improving the PD.  The reduction of pfa should be considered t he most important goal of Phase III, and consideration should be given to cost, practicality and safety implications. Potential offerors are reminded that in order for any proposals to be considered, the proposed effort MUST meet the definition of basic or applied research and development found at FAR 35.001.  The selection of one or more proposals for award will be based  on a peer and scientific evaluation of each offerors response (to include both technical an d cost aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.  Proposals shall be submitted in electronic format via the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP).  The URL for the IBOP i s https://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

The proposed action will provide  for the procurement of approximately 10,000 AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting Sets (NSN: 6665-01-504-7769) and approximately 290 AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting training sets, maintenance support for fielded systems and NET over a period of ten years (five-year base orde ring period with an option to extend the ordering period for an additional five years).  The AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting Set is a dual sensor mine detector that provides Army Combat Engineers with a much-improved capability to detect metallic and low-metallic  mines over the capabilities of the previously fielded AN/PSS-12 Mine Detecting Set.  The AN/PSS-14 Mine Detecting Set uses Ground Penetrating Radar coupled with an improved metal detector, an integrated algorithm suite, and enhanced audio features.  An AN /PSS-14 Training Set contains one (1) Sweep Monitoring System (SMS) and one Training Target Set.  The SMS, is a camera-based training tool that assists students in acquiring skills to swing the detector properly. The SMS tracks the movement of the AN/PSS-1 4's sensor head using an advanced video tracker and provides feedback to the operator regarding proper speed, height and ground coverage.  Major SMS components include: rugged, weatherproof computer; AC Power cable assembly; European wall outlet adapter; m ain interface cable assembly; Operator's Manual; Quick Reference Card; Tripod Base Assembly; Tripod Upper Mast; Tripod Foot Pad Assembly; Ground Stakes (3); camera assemblies; speaker; calibration tape; and colored foam target balls.  The training target s et (TTS) consists of simulated mine targets.  The TTS contains the following training targets: fourteen (14) anti-tank metallic targets TT-M-AT, fourteen (14) anti-personnel metallic targets TT-M-AP, twelve (12) anti-tank low-metallic targets 30 centimeter s in diameter TT-30-AT with specified metallic insert, fourteen (14) anti-tank low-metallic targets 25 centimeters in diameter TT-25-AT with specified metallic insert, twelve (12) anti-tank low-metallic targets 20 centimeters in diameter TT-20-AT with spec ified metallic insert, twelve (12) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 12 centimeters in diameter TT-12-AP with specified metallic insert, fourteen (14) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 9 centimeters in diameter TT-9-AP with specified metallic insert, a nd twelve (12) anti-personnel low-metallic targets 6 centimeters in diameter TT-6-AP with specified metallic insert.

<DESC>The Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment, has a requirement to establish a long-term business relationship for the purpose of improving and sustaining military family housing communities at the following installations:  F ort Lee, Virginia; United States Military Academy, West Point, New York; Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  Collectively, these projects are known as the 06 Group.  This requirement will be satisfied through the Army Housing privatization program known as the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI).  RCI operates as part of the Congressionally authorized Military Housing Privatization Initiative (MHPI) (10 USC 2871).  RCI employs best commercial practices in management, development, construction, maintenance a nd operation to meet the Armys long-term needs for military family housing.  The Army will award one contract for the Fort Lee project, one contract for the West Point project, and one contract for the Fort Jackson project.  The Army may also include Fort  Sill, OK as a stand-alone project or in combination with another 06 Group project.  The selected offerors will work with the Army to create a Community Development and Management Plan (CDMP) that will describe a 50-year plan to develop, re-develop, constr uct, maintain and operate the housing assets at each of the particular 06 Group projects.  The Army will solicit this requirement on an unrestricted basis using a Request for Qualifications (RFQ).  The Army intends to publish the 06 Group RFQ on or about D ecember 14, 2005.  At Step One, the RFQ will seek, from interested offerors, a five-page submission addressing three Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs).  The closing date for receipt of MER submissions will be on or about January 3, 2006.  Once the eva luation of the MERs are complete, those offerors who have satisfied the MERs shall be eligible to further compete for the 06 Group by submitting a complete Statement of Qualifications (SOQ).  Offerors will be provided a minimum of 30 calendar days to provi de their SOQ submissions.  The Army recognizes that its RCI solicitations include a Step One selection process that remains fairly constant.  Providing a mechanism to allow certain previously qualified offerors to avoid submitting duplicative documentation  for Step One can enhance Offeror and Army efficiency.  Current potential Offerors who have qualified for inclusion in the highly qualified competitive group (HQCG) in any prior Army RCI solicitation, and whose composition of principal members includes at least the same principal members (with the same responsibilities) since inclusion within that competitive group or award, may waive the requirement to submit Minimum Experience Requirements (MERs) on this solicitation.  Instructions for requesting a waiver  will be provided in the RFQ.  The Army, in its sole discretion, will determine whether the offeror fulfills the waiver requirements.  Offerors not qualifying for a waiver will be asked to submit Step One information in accordance with the RFQ.  There is n o provision for waiver of the SOQ portion of Step One.  All offerors, including those qualified to waive submission of the MERs, must submit the SOQ portion of Step One.  The 06 Group RFQ and amendments will be available at the Army RCI web page at http:// www.rci.army.mil.  Selecting the 06 Group RFQ button from the Army RCI web page will link offerors to a site where they can view and download the RFQ and amendments.  Prospective offerors will be requested to register at the site.  Registered offerors will  receive electronic notification when amendments are posted to the web page.  The Army will only respond to questions about the RFQ if they are received by electronic or facsimile medium.  The Army will not reply to any question submitted later than 10 day s prior to a submission deadline.  All comments or questions by e-mail should be directed to tracy.fetchik@hqda.army.mil.  If by facsimile, comments or question s should be directed to Tracy Fetchik at telephone (703) 604-2441 or fax (703) 602-5862.  Army responses to questions will be issued in the form of an amendment to the RFQ and can be found at the 06 Group RFQ link at http://www.rci.army.mil.  Offerors are also reminded of the Special Notice posted on October 6, 2005 announcing the Industry Forum for the privatization of Army Family Housing at Fort Jackson, SC; Fort Lee, VA; The United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, and Fort Sill, OK.

<DESC>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT ISSUES SOLICITATION FOR ?REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS? (RFQ) FROM DEVELOPERS &/OR TEAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF ?ANACOSTIA GATEWAY GOVERNMENT CENTER? (AGGC) LOCATED IN ANACOSTIA, WASHINGTON, DC


RFQ NO. POAM-2005-Q-0008-RS:       The District of Columbia government (District) is issuing a solicitation for development, design, construction and initial management of an office building to serve as the new headquarters for the District of Columbia government?s Department of Transportation (DDOT) on a site owned by the District, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, Good Hope Road and 13th Street, SE, in Washington, DC.     The project, referred to as the Anacostia Gateway Government Center (AGGC), will include 335,270 gross square feet of above grade office space on six (6) levels, 177,800 gross square feet of below grade parking for approximately 436 spaces and 14,835 useable square feet of below grade office space. The building must meet the LEED Silver Certification rating as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council. The District?s Zoning Commission has given the approval to a C-3-A PUD designation and zoning map amendment for the AGGC project.     

The District will consider development of the AGGC site either with District provided financing or with developer provided financing.     If the District chooses to provide financing for the AGGC site, it will grant a ground lease to a trustee with a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years.     The trustee will concurrently lease back to the District the ground and improvements to be constructed on the ground pursuant to a lease for a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years (the ?Master Lease?).     The trustee will sell Certificates of Participation (?COPS?) in the Master Lease payments in an amount sufficient to fund the cost of development of the AGGC site.     Funds realized from the sale of the COPS will be used by the District to pay a developer for development of the AGGC site pursuant to an agreement(s) to be entered into between the developer and the District.     Alternatively, the District may consider developer provided financing for the AGGC site through any means that utilizes Master Lease payments by the District as the sole source of re-payment of the financing.                   

At least thirty-five percent (35%) of the work for the AGGC development must be performed by the entities that are certified as either Small or Disadvantaged Business Enterprises by the OLBD.     The developer should note that the District?s LSDBE laws were recently amended and that the regulations and contractual clauses are being rewritten by the cognizant agencies.     In addition, the District?s E.E.O. Policies, Davis-Bacon Act (for construction work) and     Service Contract Act of 1965 (for     services activities) shall apply.                       

The District will consider responses to this RFQ and evaluate the quality and capabilities of proposed developers and their team members in accordance with the factors set forth in the RFQ package.     The District is not seeking site development proposals in response to this RFQ.

<DESC>Request for Proposals Notice for a Firm Fixed Price Contract for Exterior Renovations at the U.S. Courthouse in Des Moines, Iowa.  JOB PCN: RIA26510.  This procurement is a total small business set-aside under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Only offers submitted by firms, that meet the Small Business Size Standards set forth by the Small Business Administration, will be considered.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220 and the size standard is $28.5 million. Issue Request for Proposals:  on 11/28/05.  Receive Proposals: on 1/04/06.  Estimated Cost Range: $250,000 - $500,000.  Time for completion: 210 calendar days from the Notice To Proceed.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, material, and disposal required to renovate the building’s exterior entries as shown and as specified.  This work includes but not limited to, stone and concrete work, demolition, installing doors, frames and hardware, railings, lighting, painting, finishes, signage, landscaping and associated electrical and mechanical work.  Base Bid is to provide and install north entry canopy, including associated demolition, concrete and stone work, signage, landscaping and relocation of existing light fixtures as detailed and referenced in the documents.  Option 1 is to provide and install east entry canopy, including associated demolition, concrete work, railings, drainage and card reader bollard as detailed and referenced in the documents.  Option 2 is to provide and install south entry canopy as detailed and referenced in the documents.  This is a competitive negotiated acquisition.  Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selection.  The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation; which in the Government's estimation provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement.  The RFP will be issued on 11/28/05.  Proposals shall be received in this office on 1/04/06.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may make an award without discussions.  Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Two factors will be considered:  a technical evaluation factor and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factor, in order of importance are: (1) Experience and Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management and Technical Approach.  The Technical factor is more important than the price factor.  As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important.  The RFP will be available from the General Services Administration through the GPE on FedBizOps.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.  The solicitation will be available through the Federal Technical Data Solution (FedTeDS) website (fedteds.gov).  FedTeDS is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information.  It is fully integrated with other electronic government initiatives such as FedBizOps and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database, and is available for use by all Federal agencies.  At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information:  Your Company Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) (You can get this from you company CCR Point of Contact), Your Company DUNS Number or CAGE Code (Contact Dun & Bradstreet at 1-800-333-0505 if you do not have a D&B Number), Your Telephone Number, and Your Email Address.  Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may access FedTeDS via the following address www.fedteds.gov.  You will then be required to access the vendor registration form by selecting the hyperlink entitled REGISTER WITH FEDTEDS and then choosing the VENDOR REGISTRATION FORM hyperlink.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to monitor FedBizOps for any changes and/or conditions.  Any offeror submitting a proposal is required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations to use the Online Representation and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. To register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information that you need for your clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read-only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain active status.

<SOLNBR>M6297406T9002
<RESPDATE>112905
<CONTACT>Dale English 928.269.2823
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted by potential solicitors. Submitted quotes must acknowledge this amendment by annotating the amendment number and date of amendment on vendor quote. Q:  When you state the "simulator" must be reusable do you mean the actual pyrotechnic cartridge/devise? Are you intending on the ability to "reload" or "recharge" the simulator device or do you wish to reload the firing device with a cartridge of some sort? A:  The cartridges are consumable.  The simulator device must be reloadable. Q:  In some cases, a 1.4 explosive has commercial storage requirements (BAATFE).  Please clarify any storage requirements/limitations. A:  No storage requirements or limitations. Q:  Regarding the pyrotechnic charges, what distance is "safe for personnel when activated inside a closed space?” A:  The cartridges must be safe enough to be able to detonate while held by hand without injury. Q:  "Must hold and fire a minimum of three pyrotechnic charges each positioned at different angles", what are the angles? Are they horizontal or vertical? A:  The simulator must have three tubes.  One tube points straight up.  The other tubes can be anywhere from 10 to 35 degrees off vertical from the vertical tube. Q:  "Must be capable of being fired while concealed underground".....we assume a light covering of dirt (approx 1").....is this correct or is "underground a different thickness? A:  Light covering of dirt. Q:  "Pyrotechnic charges must be capable of being fired independently of Simulator Base."  We assume this means the cartridge/device should be able to be set on the ground or in a hole, etc… and be wired to the firing device and fired without the base (that holds it in a preset angle). Is this correct? A:  Yes Q:  Is a double action trigger required since there is a requirement that, "The firing device must be small enough to be carried in the pocket of a military issue field jacket".  A double action trigger requires the deliberate initiation of two switches or series of buttons. Is this correct? A:  No.  Double trigger is not required.  A covered firing device is acceptable. Q:  Sound:  Is there a requirement how loud, at what distance?  Flash:  Is there a requirement on how bright....candlepower? A:  Flash must be a minimum of 1 million candlepower at point of detonation.  Smoke must be seen at least  one-half (0.5) mile away.  Noise must be at least 120 decibels at 30 yards. Q:  Is there any chance of an extension in the response date? A:  Product must be available for upcoming exercise.  Closing date cannot be extended.

<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for aeronautical rotary wing engineering, research and development, systems analysis and modeling and simulation. It is anticipated that NASA ARC shall issue a task order contract whereby individual task orders will be issued during the performance period.  The following areas are listed as examples of task order subjects: Rotorcraft Aeromechanics Modeling and Analysis The contractor shall develop comprehensive aeromechanics models for engineering analysis.  Perform automated flight test simulation services to support flight tests.  Perform services to validate aeromechanics models and simulations.  Evaluate the design of aeromechanics models in terms of performance, stability, handling qualities, and other parameters.   Simulation Facility Hardware and Software Development for Experimental Research and Feasibility Assessments The contractor shall provide services to design and develop scenarios for mission simulation exercises.  Coordinate GFE models and simulations with the Government multi-participant simulation demonstrations and simulation.   Aircraft Performance, Handling Qualities, Cockpit Displays, and Flight Control Systems Analysis and Evaluation The contractor shall provide services to evaluate the handling qualities of fixed and rotary wing aircraft.  Evaluate and design control laws for new aircraft flight control systems and upgrades to existing systems.   Distributed and Non-Distributed Models and Simulation Information Technology Services The contractor shall provide services to apply Information Technology principles to the analysis, use, and application of models and simulations in all phases of the software development processes. These services will encompass, among others, the application of high fidelity models and simulations library components to enhance advanced rotorcraft simulations, and the development and application of Verification and Validation (V&V) policies, procedures, and methodologies for aged monolithic models and simulations and distributed simulation systems. Under this task, the contractor will provide a staff of simulation analysts, and simulation, software, and satellite navigation engineering subject matter experts that can apply their expertise to aid the Government in the design, development, and V&V of advanced rotorcraft simulations, including real-time, high-fidelity, human-in-the-loop simulations for piloted operational assessments of future aircraft concepts.  This expertise shall include experience in the design, implementation, and testing of navigation, surveillance, guidance and control, communications, and subsystems hardware and software, a novel approach to the V&V of complex legacy and developing simulation software that incorporates the use of automated tools, and hands-on experience in prototype V&V activities for distributed interactive simulations. Human-In-The-Loop Simulation Research and Development, Test and Evaluation, and Training Provide services to develop design for experiments on rotorcraft mission effectiveness ranging from analytical studies through part-task simulation to full-mission simulation.  These experiments are expected to entail the use of flight simulators for both research on and training of pilot subjects and to require both traditional and innovative experimental design in applied behavioral research.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

1.	Introduction:

USAID/Serbia and Montenegro (USAID/SaM is recruiting a Senior Project Development Officer in its Program Office to provide leadership, advice and support to the Mission’s technical office/strategic objective (SO) teams for program and project development. USAID/SaM will have its new multiyear strategy in place for FY06 which will require the design of a whole range of new activities.  The new Agency strategy process has resulted in a more flexible, long-term strategy framework, that places more emphasis on the activity design stage to ensure compliance with the various policies and rules that govern strategic design and implementation.  Accordingly, design work will be even more important and challenging under the Agency’s new strategy process, and guidance has not yet been finalized.  At the same time, the Mission is in a critical transition period, moving from its early program (and organizational) stage to a more mature program and organization and also shifting to more integrated design under strategic teams as opposed to office structures.  Much of the local staff is still relatively new to USAID and therefore lacks experience in activity design.   Further complexity is due to the strong role that the US Embassy is currently playing in  program planning and funding which creates additional review processes for the Mission.  Finally, during the transition to a new Strategy, there will also be a significant number of activities that need to be closed out – another area in which Mission staff lacks expertise.  The incumbent will provide overall project development support to the Mission’s SO teams in both Serbia and in Montenegro.  The incumbent is also expected to do extensive on the job training for CTOs, as well as Program Office staff, in the area of activity design, implementation and closeout.  

2.	Objective:

USAID/SaM desires to hire one, senior Project Development Officer (SrPDO) under an off-shore US Personal Services Contract.  This Position Description details required services of this SrPDO who will provide leadership and guidance to the Mission in program and project design, implementation and closeout, as well as overall program planning and policy development.




3.	Basic Functions of the Position:

The incumbent will be assigned backstopping responsibilities for the entire program portfolio for Serbia and Montenegro and will report to and be supervised by the Program Officer.  The primary purpose of the position is to provide professional guidance and assistance to the Mission's SO teams in program actions from design through closeout.   This will include providing: 1) extensive training for CTOs, both on an on-the-job and more formal basis; 2) operational coordination and explanation of USAID policies, procedures and regulations to facilitate effective program planning, programmatic operations and an efficient working relationship between the Mission, Embassy, host government officials, grantees, contractors and other diverse private sector interests; and 3) critical consultation and review and quality control for all Mission documentation of program activities.

4.	Duties and Responsibilities:

In accomplishing the objectives of this position, the SrPDO shall exercise independent judgment, programmatic leadership, problem solving skills and cultural sensitivity in executing duties including, but not limited to the following:

A.	Activity Design:  Assist SO teams in the development and design of programs and projects from conceptualization through authorization, with particular emphasis on providing guidance to SO teams on the scheduling of design activities, securing appropriate technical expertise, reviewing required analyses and ensuring sufficiency of documentation.           

1)        Coordinate to ensure an integrated approach across SO teams in the development of new activity designs that fall within the new Strategy.
				
2)	Assist Mission SO teams in the development, review and approval of Concept Papers and Activity Approval Documents under the new Strategy.

3)	Provide coordination and facilitation on all aspects of project development actions between Technical Offices, Program, Financial Management and Executive Offices, Legal Advisor, Contracting Officer, and other technical experts and consultants.

4)	Provide assistance with the critical review, consultation, and quality control of all Mission project development documents to ensure conformity with strategy, Embassy RPA and/or MPP, and USAID regulations, rules and procedures.  

B.	Implementation:  Provide implementation support and guidance to SO teams to identify and avoid potential problems and, as required, to resolve them, to ensure that appropriate procedures are utilized, and to ensure that documentation is complete, accurate and in compliance with agency rules and guidelines.   

1)	Provide support to SO teams to avoid/resolve implementation problems and to assess/improve the quality of implementation activities and processes.

2)	Assist project managers with the preparation of correspondence and documentation (e.g. letters, progress reports, action memoranda, MAARDs, etc.).

3)	Assist, when necessary, with other project implementation actions such as the preparation of waivers. 

C.	Activity Closeouts:  Assist SO teams with the procedures for closeout of existing activities, ensuring proper documentation and compliance with U.S. and local requirements.    
                                                                                      
D.	Evaluation and Monitoring:  Working with the Performance Monitoring Program (PMP)specialist, assist with the development of the new PMP, and ensure that there are monitoring and evaluation processes in place to address all critical aspects of assessing implementation results, attainment of objectives specified in project documentation, programmatic impact of projects and presentation of lessons learned under the new Strategy.

E.	Reporting and other duties: Assists SO teams, as necessary, with reporting on achieving the Mission’s overall program; assures that such reporting represents and justifies Serbia and Montenegro’s future program plans to USAID/Washington and Congress; ensures that such reporting contributes to effective management of the development program.  
                                             
5.	Position Elements

A.	Supervision/Oversight of Others

1)	Supervision Received:  The incumbent will have a broad development background; therefore, s/he will independently carry out the functions of this position, based on general procedural guidelines and strategic/policy direction from his/her supervisor.  S/he will report directly to the Program Officer.

2)	Supervision Exercised:  Will Supervise 2 FSNs and have technical oversight of an additional 3 FSNs in the Serbia and Montenegro offices.

B.	Available Guidelines

The incumbent works within the broad framework of policy and operating procedures established in USAID’s ADS and policy determinations, USAID/SaM Mission Orders, Activity Approval Documents, strategy documents, grants/contracts and related documents.   

C.	Knowledge

The incumbent will serve as the highest level expert in the Mission on USAID ADS and Policies.  A minimum of 10 years of directly relevant experience is required in order to have the sufficient knowledge and expertise to function in this position.  Incumbent will be responsible for leading and directing a substantial number of other professional/technical staff, in addition to the two professional FSNs directly supervised.  Given the innovative and unique character of the USAID program in Serbia and Montenegro, and the challenging transition to a new Strategy with still evolving requirements for design, implementation and evaluation, the incumbent is required to make recommendations and to initiate actions in areas and situations which will not always be covered by available written guidelines.

D.	Exercise of Independence

In discussions with grantees, contractors and representatives of the host government, the incumbent will be asked to explain the USAID program from varying perspectives.  These may range from broad program planning and strategy development considerations to detailed procedures, guidelines and policies set forth in USAID documentation regarding project/program development and negotiation, implementation, evaluation and monitoring.  Within USAID, the incumbent will play a leading role in project/program development and be a key player in providing advise related to strategic/program planning, implementation monitoring and program evaluation.  These roles will require independent evaluation of problems and issues, conceptualization of programs and strategies to attain development objectives, and provision of technical and professional guidance to various offices in the Mission and senior Mission Management.

E.	Authority to Make Commitments

The incumbent does not have the authority to make financial or other commitments on behalf of the USG.  However, on occasion he/she will be called upon to explain and interpret to outsiders USAID guidelines and policies in areas regarding the incumbent's range of responsibilities.

F.	Nature, Level and Purpose of Contacts

Often represents the Program Office at meetings involving all levels of Mission staff, including Office Directors, the Deputy Mission Director and the Mission Director, involving the full range of Mission from program planning and project conceptualization through measuring and reporting on program impact.  Incumbent will represent the Mission, as necessary, in discussions with the Embassy to ensure understanding of overall requirements for program design and implementation.  Incumbent will represent the Program Office and Mission at meetings and discussions regarding these matters with senior personnel of grantees, and contractors.  Incumbent will establish and maintain contacts (phone, e-mail, correspondence, cables) with a range of USAID officials on matters pertaining to these responsibilities.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND
The Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) is a program developed by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous disasters worldwide, it became clear that OFDA could not find in a timely manner adequate staff to cover all positions in the field, in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  OFDA's Senior Management Team (SMT) approved a program which would bring on board select candidates who could work on a part-time basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within hours to facilitate OFDA's response to disasters.  RATS positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.
INTRODUCTION

OFDA is the office within the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (OFDA/DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  OFDA/DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  OFDA/DRM employs sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (OFDA/PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations (OFDA/OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OFDA/OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Support Program (DASP), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The RATS program is managed by the Overseas Administration Team (OAT) in the OFDA/OPS Division.  This team maintains a database for all contracted RATS, providing information to the rest of the office on their availability, skills and previous OFDA experience.  The OAT assists the program offices within OFDA in choosing the best qualified RATS for any specific task, and provides administrative and personnel support to existing RATS.  Each RATS incumbent will provide enhancement to the OFDA team according to his/her skills.  They will be considered part of OFDA-Washington resources that can be deployed worldwide.  At times they may also be a resource for the DCHA Bureau.  Foreign language ability in one or more major world languages is preferred.

OBJECTIVES
The SMT has determined that OFDA needs to maintain a roster of 50 to 75 RATS to meet its surge capacity objectives.  Each incumbent will be deployable to backfill Washington positions, to field offices for staff enhancement, on DARTs and RMTs as disaster response demands, and for assessments of critical situations as warranted.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RATS respond to humanitarian emergencies -- natural, technological and conflict-related disasters -- as required, worldwide.  The contractor may serve in the OFDA Washington offices as staff enhancement when critical shortages of staff occur and on RMTs, which provide program, administrative, technical and logistics support to OFDA DARTs from Washington.  The contractor may also be required to travel on short notice as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team or a DART or to backfill staff members in OFDA regional or program offices overseas.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being accepted and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-20.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541430.  The applicable size standard is $6M.  Commerce Business Daily Note 1 applies to this requirement.  The requirement is to apply high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight Air Force buses in accordance with the following Statement of Work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  Scope:  The 12th Mission Support Group Vehicle Management Flight (12 MSG/LGRV) requires application of a shrink-wrap style vinyl graphic to four sides of eight buses used by their distinguished visitor support section.  These buses are driven throughout the San Antonio area and are ridden by the highest-level executives in the Air Force and other DoD components and must meet the highest quality standards in terms of appearance and durability.

2.  Objective:  The overall objective of this requirement is to install high-quality graphic designs to four sides of eight buses designated by the 12 MSG/LGRV.

3.  Description of Work:  The contractor shall provide all personnel, transportation, equipment, tools, labor, supplies, materials, and supervision necessary to produce and install the vinyl wrap for each bus, unless otherwise stipulated.  The contractor is required to perform the required work on-site in a facility mutually agreed upon by the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV and the contractor is responsible for cleaning the work area daily.  The contractor will produce vinyl graphics, from designs supplied electronically by 12 MSG/LGRV, and apply them to the front, rear, left-hand, and right-hand side of each bus described in the listing of buses to wrap.  One exception is bus 04B2278.  This bus already has vinyl wrap applied.  It only requires application of the Randolph design, described below, to the right-hand side.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining the precise measurements of each vehicle to be covered, prior to production and installation of the vinyl wrap.  The front, rear, and left-hand side graphic are described as the “Recruiting design,” and the right-hand side graphic is described as the “Randolph design.”  The contractor is responsible for preparation of the vehicular surfaces prior to application of the vinyl wrap.  The designs will be applied, conforming to the contours of the vehicular body, covering each entire side and in the event of sectional overlap of the design panels, the graphic will match at the intersection of subject seams.  The panel(s) will extend the entire width of each body side with a minimum of 18-inch overlap onto the roof section of the vehicle(s).  The contractor will trim and fit the panels according to the window and door moldings, corrugated body panels, etc., to ensure all doors, windows, existing body panels, etc., are fully functional upon completion of the work.  Sections of the panels that cover windows or glass portions of the vehicle will be of the type that allow one-way viewing from the inside to the outside of the passenger carrying compartment.  The only exception to glass coverage is the windshield; it will not have any vinyl coverage.  Additionally, the contractor will remove exterior lighting assemblies, door handles, locks, cameras, etc. to properly install the vinyl wrap and reinstall the same prior to completion of the work.  All components removed and reinstalled by the contractor to facilitate installation of the vinyl wrap will be fully functional.  The contractor will apply the Recruiting design to the front, rear, and left-hand side of each bus and the Randolph design to the right-hand side of each bus.  The contractor will re-size the overall graphic to conform proportionally to the varying size of each vehicle.  Prior to production and application of the vinyl panels, the contractor will provide 12 MSG/LGRV digital imagery of re-sized graphics on a representative image of the subject vehicle for final approval.  The specific sequence of wrapping the subject buses is limited to availability from daily operations and will be coordinated/scheduled jointly between the contractor and 12 MSG/LGRV.  Completion of the described work should be accomplished no later than 1 April 2006.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>Synopsis This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial hardware prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated  provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05. The number assigned to it this  solicitation W15P7T-06-Q-B403.

This action is for limited  competition between any vendor with a business relationship with Isuzu.  Isuzu is the only manufacturing source listed on the  Source Control Drawing (SCD) for this diesel engine.  Isuzu is the only source that possesses technical data (drawings or  specifications) that completely defines the form, fit, and function (F3) of this item. The SCD contains Isuzus commercial  part number (C240PW-28), and specific engine calibration and painting requirements. The SCD provides top-level information on  the required item, but does not provide detailed manufacturing, testing or acceptance data that would be needed by any other  source to manufacture this item. Only Isuzus diesel engine meets all of the Governments performance requirements.  Isuzu  manufactures this diesel engine from a standard product line, customizing the engine for the Governments applications using  parts from a standard set of accessories and alternative parts.  There are no nationally recognized industry standards or  specifications that define the F3 of this diesel engine. Failure to acquire these diesel engines will result in a lack of  equipment needed to provide power to the 15kW Tactical Quiet Generators (TQG).  Note, the Isuzu supplied mechanical governor  components that are not used in the 15 kW TQG configurations shall be removed from the engine prior to preservation and  packaging.  A plate or other sealing stiff protective material shall be installed in place of the governor components to  protect internal components of the engine.  The standard commercial warranty applies to this procurement, and the warranty  period shall be a minimum of one year.  Any changes or modifications from the C-240PW-28 shall be submitted in writing to the  Government IAW 52.212-4(c) Changes.  Packaging shall be in accordance with MIL-STD-129 level A, Military Special Packaging  Instructions (SPI) AG000000605.  Barcode markings shall be done in accordance with MIL-STD- 130 L.  The contractor shall  provide UID, or DoD recognized unique identification equivalent, for all items delivered with an acquisition cost of $5000 or  more. UID markings shall be IAW MIL-STD-130L with change 1.  UID Data Submittals: The contractor shall enter the UID data  submittals into the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. See the DoD website for the latest information  http://www.acq.osd.mil/uid.  When UID markings are required for embedded items in this contract then the contractor shall  supply the data required IAW with CDRL for DI-MGMT-80177A and this SOW.  The contractor shall apply passive RFID tags to all  items identified under the contract shipped to DoD IAW MIL-STD-129P w/Change 3, Paragraphs 4.9 through 4.9.4.  Shipments will  be made as FOB Destination with Inspection/Acceptance FOB Source.  All items shall be shipped to New Cumberland Facility, New  Cumberland, PA.  One hundred (100) units must be delivered 300 days after contract (DAC) award, and 100 per month thereafter.   Expedited delivery is encouraged at no additional cost to  the Government. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors are required to complete  and submit a copy of the FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; this provision  is to be sent as a separate electronic attachment. Proposals must be submitted via email to  mark.junda@mail1.monmouth.army.mil, by 7 December 2005 at 1600 EST. The anticipated award date is on or around 12 December  2005.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command proposes to procure detonation cord assemblies consisting of Shielded Mild Detonating Cord, Warhead Separation Charge, Thrust Termination Assembly, Manifold and Witness Cap.  This is a combined synopsis/soli citation.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The action is for commercial items, as defined in FAR 2.101, and will be processed pursuant section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as impleme nted in FAR 13.500(a), to the test program authorized in FAR 13.500(a).  The detonation cords and assemblies will be used in the fabrication of Telemetry/Flight Termination Systems for Army TACMS.  These systems are being built from an existing and proven drawing package, which specifies the type detonation cords and assemblies to be used.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 based on extensive market research for this commercial item.  This procurement is restricted to McCormick Selph, Inc., dba Pacific Scientific, 3601 Union Road, Hollister, CA 95023.   No other manufacturer can provide the detonation cords and assemblies wit hout performing non-recurring engineering and environmental qualification which would incur a duplication of costs and effort that would not likely be recovered through open competition.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to res pond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all proposals received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis.  A determinati on by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduc t a competitive procurement.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT ISSUES SOLICITATION FOR “REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS” (RFQ) FROM DEVELOPERS &/OR TEAMS FOR DEVELOPMENT, DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF “ANACOSTIA GATEWAY GOVERNMENT CENTER” (AGGC) LOCATED IN ANACOSTIA, WASHINGTON, DC


RFQ NO. POAM-2005-Q-0008-RS:	The District of Columbia government (District) is issuing a solicitation for development, design, construction and initial management of an office building to serve as the new headquarters for the District of Columbia government’s Department of Transportation (DDOT) on a site owned by the District, located at the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, Good Hope Road and 13th Street, SE, in Washington, DC.  The project, referred to as the Anacostia Gateway Government Center (AGGC), will include 335,270 gross square feet of above grade office space on six (6) levels, 177,800 gross square feet of below grade parking for approximately 436 spaces and 14,835 useable square feet of below grade office space. The building must meet the LEED Silver Certification rating as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council. The District’s Zoning Commission has given the approval to a C-3-A PUD designation and zoning map amendment for the AGGC project.  

The District will consider development of the AGGC site either with District provided financing or with developer provided financing.  If the District chooses to provide financing for the AGGC site, it will grant a ground lease to a trustee with a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years.  The trustee will concurrently lease back to the District the ground and improvements to be constructed on the ground pursuant to a lease for a lease term of not less than twenty (20) years (the “Master Lease”).  The trustee will sell Certificates of Participation (“COPS”) in the Master Lease payments in an amount sufficient to fund the cost of development of the AGGC site.  Funds realized from the sale of the COPS will be used by the District to pay a developer for development of the AGGC site pursuant to an agreement(s) to be entered into between the developer and the District.  Alternatively, the District may consider developer provided financing for the AGGC site through any means that utilizes Master Lease payments by the District as the sole source of re-payment of the financing.         

At least thirty-five percent (35%) of the work for the AGGC development must be performed by the entities that are certified as either Small or Disadvantaged Business Enterprises by the OLBD.  The developer should note that the District’s LSDBE laws were recently amended and that the regulations and contractual clauses are being rewritten by the cognizant agencies.  In addition, the District’s E.E.O. Policies, Davis-Bacon Act (for construction work) and  Service Contract Act of 1965 (for  services activities) shall apply.           

The District will consider responses to this RFQ and evaluate the quality and capabilities of proposed developers and their team members in accordance with the factors set forth in the RFQ package.  The District is not seeking site development proposals in response to this RFQ.

Finally, senior civilian and military installations staff attend the course, so that adds GS-13s and more Navy CDRs.
