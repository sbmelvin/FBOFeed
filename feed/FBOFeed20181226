 Description/Salient Characteristics

DRAFT
Brand Name or Equal

3 - LS600 Liftseats (toilet seat lifts/risers/accessories) to decrease patient falls while toileting - #LS600-AP-615
Site: Omaha, NE

Scope:
The toilet seat riser must have the following capabilities:
Assist in the decelerate while descending when doing a stand to sit or sit-to-stand movement.
Ability to increase the weight capacity of existing toilet by the ability to place the liftseat over the toilet for heavier patients.  
Ability to use at bedside then able to park over the existing toilet once the patient progresses in ambulation.

Performance Specifications: 
    Vertical Lifting Height:                10 inches
Rotational Arc:                      20 Degrees
Horizontal Movement:                4 inches
Height:                             40  (at push bar)
seating height:                       17.5  to 21

Weight Rating:                      650 pounds

The vendor will customize the push bar to fit the bathroom space for the Omaha locations.  

The LiftSeat converts facility toilets to taller ADA height and increased weight rating without costly
construction and plumbing modifications.

Reduces the risk of staff and patient injury by delivering the hip, knee, and ankle joint support required during the sit-to-stand motion path.

Pod design encloses mechanics for easy unit cleaning; open front enables easy cleaning of toilet and surrounding area.

Large flat transfer seat with removable grab bars. 

Should move easily and lock in place to provide bedside and over-the-toilet assistance anywhere in your facility.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), is issuing this sources sought/notice of intent solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation; therefore, do not submit a quote.  There is no obligation for the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI/sources sought/notice of intent.  No funds have been authorized or received for this effort. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and the Government will not pay for any time expended or information submitted in response to this notice. In accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations, responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Eligibility in participating in a possible, future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.
BACKGROUND
VBA, for its own operations and in collaboration with the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and Veterans Health Administration (VHA), requires authoritative birth certificates, death certificates and/or the ability to make queries confirming the fact of a person's death to support ongoing operations. VBA, VHA and NCA will use this information to independently confirm and/or correct other, potentially inaccurate reports of birth and death received from a variety of sources. VBA, VHA and NCA use birth and death data for many purposes including: 1) establishing eligibility to increased payments for newborn children of a Veteran award beneficiary; 2) terminating benefits when a Veteran or beneficiary is confirmed to be deceased; 3) granting benefits to the survivors of a deceased Veteran; 4) providing burial services for the interment of a deceased Veteran; 5) cancelling appointments and prescription medications for a deceased Veteran. Confirmation and/or correction of death and birth information allows VBA, VHA and NCA to more effectively comply with legislation barring improper payments and more effectively prevent the inadvertent shipments of controlled prescription drugs while also improving data quality in VBA systems 

The Veterans Benefits Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Contract with National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems (NAPHSIS) for the furnishing of authoritative birth and death certificates and queries on fact of death. NAPHSIS is a non-profit national association whose members represent state and local vital records, health statistics and information system agencies and is located in District of Columbia, with offices in Silver Springs, Maryland. It is estimated that VBA will require up to approximately 55,000 queries of fact on death, 36,000 death certificates and 5,000 birth certificates over a twelve-month period. (Subject to change, as needed). The resulting contract will be for a base period with four twelve-month option periods. NAPHSIS is an organization comprising the vital statistics offices of all 50 state governments, several US territories and New York City's vital statistics office. NAPHSIS' system directly connects to databases in almost all of these state and territory governments (48, notably excluding Texas and New York State   outside of NYC). In considering the data required, VBA considered the two critical criteria necessary for effective and expedient reliance on records: 1) the authoritativeness of the data; and, 2) the geographical coverage from this this information could be sourced. 

While other sources may exist, none of the sources reviewed as part of the market research identified the authoritative data set required by VBA. In accordance with FAR 6.305, the Justification will be posted to FBO within 14 days following an award. However, all other responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency. Capability statements will be considered only from entities who are regularly established in the business called for and whom in the judgment of the Contracting Officer (CO) are financially responsible and able to show evidence of their reliability, ability, experience, facilities and personnel to render prompt and satisfactory service and that the data produced is the authoritative data required to enable VBA to make decisions. 

Interested parties responding to this sources sought/notice of intent request shall submit the following information at a minimum:

(1) company name and address, point of contact with phone number, and DUNS number; (2) documentation relating to capability as outlined in this notice; (3) socio-economic denomination or intentions of subcontracting to a socio-economic category; (4) proof of CVE Certification in the VA Vet Biz website or intention of registration prior to submission of offers to a solicitation; Registration may be accomplished at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/

Again, this notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature outlined above, to the Contracting Officer no later than January 2, 2019 by 12:00pm EST. Electronic submissions are acceptable via Mario.quilici@va.gov

<DESC>Dear Industry Partner,
<p><br />This is to advise the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) contractor community of contracts that are affected by a lapse in appropriations.</p>
<p>As you are aware, a full year appropriation or a continuing resolution has not been enacted for the current fiscal year. As a result, certain existing contracts will be stopped.</p>
<p>The contracting officer for each affected contract will promptly provide appropriate notice to the contractor in accordance with the terms and conditions of the affected contract. The notice will contain the necessary directions to adjust the contract due to the lapse in the appropriations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contract non-exempt list is provided and serves as official notice to contractors. If your respective contract(s) is on the list, you are required to immediately stop work. Any work done after receipt of this notice is at your own risk and will not be reimbursed. Do not resume work until provided a written cancellation of a stop work order by a warranted contracting officer. I thank you for your assistance during this funding lapse. Please immediately provide a stop-work order to any and all subcontractors on this Contract.</p>
<p>Lastly, contract invoice payments may be delayed. Contractors will be notified once funding is available and the Government has returned to normal operations.&nbsp; For contracts that are not affected at the onset of the lapse in appropriations, FEMA does not plan to provide any separate notifications or communications of that fact. Unless the contracting officer provides a formal notification to the contrary, all contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p>FEMA will provide periodic updates to the contract list based on mission needs.</p>
<p>We appreciate your continued partnership supporting FEMA's mission during this funding uncertainty.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bobby McCane<br />Head of Contracting Activity</p>

<DESC><strong>This notice is not a request for proposal.&nbsp;</strong>The General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service, Region 8 (hereinafter also referred to as "Region 8"), anticipates an award of a contract to ProSource Consulting, LLC under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." A solicitation for this requirement will not be made available, and this notice is for informational purposes only. All responsible sources that believe they can perform these services in their entirety and at a reasonable price must submit a written notification of interest and provide a capability statement no later than January 10, 2018 by 11:59 p.m. Mountain Daylight Time (MDT) which will be considered by the agency. Any written notice of interest and capability statements must be submitted directly to Dylan White at dylan.white@gsa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Description of Services. </strong>Region 8 requires operations, maintenance, and other facility support services at the Chief Mountain Land Based Port of Entry (Chief Mountain LBPOE), State Highway 17, Babb, MT 59411 and the Piegan Land Based Port of Entry (Piegan LBPOE), US Highway 89, Babb, MT 59411. The identified services include all management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, equipment, tools, and supplies to effective, efficiently, and economically provide services for the satisfactory cleaning, operations, and maintenance at the Chief Mountain LBPOE and Piegan LBPOE facilities (Port Facilities). Normal hours at the Port Facilities are 7:00&nbsp;- 23:00, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Region 8 requires the contractor to be available to respond during facility operating hours during a standard 8 hour work day and provide for emergency call personnel on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Excluded from operations and maintenance services are the housing units located at the port facilities, except for electrical systems and equipment. Other exclusions from the requirement include security systems, telecommunication systems, equipment owned and operated by the tenant agencies, furnishings (not installed fixtures), kitchen appliances and equipment (except ductwork, grease traps, and associated fire suppression and alarm equipment), equipment owned by public utilities, upgrades of software and software licenses, and fitness center equipment. The contractor shall be responsible for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance and repairs of equipment and systems located within the property line of the Port Facilities. Other services provided at the facilities include snow removal and grounds maintenance. Contractor is responsible for furnishing all necessary heavy equipment and other items needed to clear or haul snow and ice from parking areas, roads, driveways, plaza areas, and other covered areas within the property line.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Operations and maintenance work includes preventative and predictive maintenance of building systems and equipment. The contractor is required to conduct tours of the building equipment at set frequencies and record information in accordance with appropriate procedures. Generally, operational services shall be provided for all systems to maintain a safe and healthy environment operating within normal parameters. Efficiency of operation shall be maintained in order to preserve the asset value of the facility and systems and minimize operating costs to the Government.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Generally, the anticipated scope is for performance-based services that describe the expected outcomes and results within measurable standards to evaluate performance. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordination efforts, communication, quality control, management of records and reports, and scheduling. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the management and supervision of all subcontractors.<br /></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Justification for Sole Source Contracting Action. </strong>The incumbent contractor, ProSource Consulting, LLC is uniquely positioned to have a competitive advantage that could not be reasonably overcome through a competitive acquisition process. As a three month contract for bridge services it is impractical for a new contractor to recover costs. Identified costs include processing security clearances, mobilization costs, inspection of existing conditions, development of a quality control program, hiring, training, and other startup costs. ProSource Consulting, LLC is already mobilized at the facilities and will not incur these initial costs. The remote location of the facilities also presents significant costs of mobilization, and no other sources are located in the surrounding area to offset these costs. Accordingly, if the requirement was competed, there is a reasonable expectation that the Government would not receive a proposal from at least one other source for a three-month contract.<br /><br /></div>
<div>Other considerations include the importance of a continuity of operations at the port facilities to avoid a lapse in support services. The operations, maintenance, custodial, and other facility support services provided at these locations are critical to safety, security, general well-being, and operational missions of the facilities. Facility support services are also necessary to preserve the asset and ensure efficient and economical operations.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Efforts to Obtain Competition. </strong>General knowledge of the Montana market from GSA officials and past acquisition efforts and experience support the&nbsp;decision not to compete the requirement. It is highly unlikely that any other contractor is proximate enough to the project locations to overcome identified initial costs over a three-month period; these costs are not incurred by the incumbent contractor. Region 8 is actively working on a new contract with a base period, and four, one-year option periods that is economically viable for other interested contractors. Region 8 made reasonable planning efforts to compete and procure services for full facilities maintenance at the Port Facilities. However, delays outside the Government's control adversely impacted the schedule and has resulted in a planning horizon that is unreasonable to effectively procure the required services before the expiration of the existing contract. Thus, the proposed sole source contracting action to add three months through 02/01/2019 and 04/30/2019 to the existing contract is the best decision given the acquisition history and circumstances.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Additional Information. </strong>This special notice shall not be construed as a request for proposal nor as a commitment by the Government. The Government shall not be responsible for any costs incurred in response to this special notice.</div>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

DELIVERABLES:
Price Proposal

REQUIREMENTS: 

Contractor shall provide a projected schedule in terms of days from the time of award addressing (at a minimum) the following milestones: verification that all system quantities and configurations are accurate; manufacture/assembly of all parts and/or equipment; delivery to identified location; and complete installation of hardware.  
 


Background: The Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) is currently using Tonometer prisms for Tonometry test in the Eye Clinic. Tonometry is a diagnostic test that measures the pressure inside your eye, which is called intraocular pressure (IOP). This measurement can assists physicians in determining whether or not a patient may be at risk of glaucoma. The Tono-Pen is a handheld device that gives a digital readout of the pressure and the pen is classified as non-critical Reusable Medical Equipment (RME). The prism is attached to the Tono-Pen and is the actual accessory that touches the eye for the measurements to be taken and this is classified as semi-critical RME as to the fact that it comes into contact with a mucous membrane. Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC) currently needs to increase the par-level of prisms due to the increase in Tonometry test performed in the Eye Clinic.
 
Project Scope: The overall cost of this purchase is with Tonometer Prisms for $52,125.00

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: The MEDVAMC has a requirement to provide quality care for our Veterans.  We have a need for additional and replacement instruments for scheduled Tonometry tests.    Tonometry is a diagnostic test that measures the pressure inside your eye, which is called intraocular pressure (IOP). This measurement can assist physicians in determining whether a patient may be at risk of glaucoma. The Tono-Pen is a handheld device that gives a digital readout of the pressure and the pen is classified as non-critical Reusable Medical Equipment (RME). The prism is attached to the Tono-Pen and is the actual accessory that touches the eye for the measurements to be taken and this is classified as semi-critical RME as to the fact that it encounters a mucous membrane. Additionally, MEDVAMC staff members are already familiar with the use and reprocessing procedures for this brand.  Therefore, the need to train or re-educate would be eliminated.  Thus, staff errors will be minimized and patient care will be improved.  In efforts to standardize the reprocessing procedures for surgical reusable equipment, uniformity in 

product brand is necessary and critical.  Interchangeable parts and attachments are currently stock items and can only be replaced by trained medical center staff.  To satisfy this unusual and compelling situation while maintaining the need for 

compatibility, standardization with existing equipment, and training requirements.
 
UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE BRAND NAME, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  The Haag-Streit Tonometer Prisms distinguish themselves by their optical and mechanical performance which allows for fast and reliable measurements in daily practice. They are largely handmade by experienced workers and checked for low tolerances in weight, optical quality, durability and for consistent measurement results. They can be disinfected with several commercially available disinfectants. To acquire another brand would create substantial duplication of cost to the facility thru supplies and additional staff training and equipment needed for proper sterilization. The purchase of an equivalent product could cause further delays in patient care and increase the potential risk of staff error with equipment operational differences between systems and sterilization techniques. Compliance with VHA Directive 2009-031, equipment should be standardized when possible to ensure that set up, use and reprocessing are conducted properly.  Compatibility with existing equipment and continuity of services precludes consideration of a product manufactured by another company. 


Offeror shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s).

Offerors must complete annual representations and certifications on-line at http://www.acquisition.gov in accordance with FAR 52.212-3,  Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.

52.209-5 Representation by Corporations Regarding an Unpaid Tax Liability or a Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law(Deviation) (March 2012) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. § 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. § 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. § 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>

<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and</p>
<p>(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.</p>
<p>Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.</p>
<p>(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:</p>

<p>(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.</p>
