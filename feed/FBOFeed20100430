<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the BURNS PAIUTE TRIBE to trap and transport bull trout at Agency Valley Dam.
The deliverables under this contract will address certain terms and conditions of the 2005 Biological Opinion and maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  The opinion directs Reclamation to implement measures to minimize the effects and or amount of take associated with operation of Agency Valley Dam. 
The requirement - Trap and return bull trout that are entrained at Agency Valley Dam back to Beulah reservoir or the north Fork Malheur River upstream from the dam. 
 All bull trout entrained below the dam would otherwise suffer take through death due to poor habitat conditions in the river.
Services required are for the trap and transport of federally protected animals to reduce take and maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act for federal actions.  This is an exclusive governmental service requiring a federal permit that mandates expertise in care and handling of federally protected animals. 
The Tribe has done the most advanced fisheries work in this remote area and therefore is the most knowledgeable entity to trap and transport federally listed bull trout. The Tribes employ staff members who are trained and federally permitted for the capture and handling of ESA protected species and have completed these activities for Reclamation since the listing of bull trout in 1998.  The BPT currently holds a permit to capture and transport fish in the State of Oregon. 
Parties who believe they have knowledge sufficient to respond may e-mail their firm's qualifications to the following address.  mday@pn.usbr.gov   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Electrical and Mechanical Systems Safety Branch, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to EM Software &amp; Systems, Inc. to procure electromagnetic software called FEKO and hardware key to run on 32 bit dual core processor running Window XP.
<p>Purpose and objective: <br />FEKO combines multiple electromagnetic computational techniques in one code. <br />FEKO is based primarily on method of moments (MOM) but as the problem dimensions<br />increase relative to a wavelength, the code can implement multilevel fast multipole<br />method (MLFMM), finite element (FEM), physical optics (PO), geometric optics (GO),<br />or universal theory of diffraction (UTD). Portions of a problem can be solved using one<br />of these alternative solution techniques and the complete solution seamlessly joined.</p>
<p>FEKO is the only computational software package that can cover the complete range of frequencies (from 1000 Hz to 6 GHz) of interest in our research. The ability to take portions of the problem and solve them using independent approaches and then link the answers to obtain a solution over the total volume of interest is very valuable and in the government's best interest.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written item description/item characteristics and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward the item description and pricing information to Margaret L. Mooney, CDC NIOSH, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, Reference 2010-Q-12140. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all item descriptions and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with EM Software &amp; Systems, 144 Research Drive, Hampton, VA 23666 as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Department of Public Health Sciences, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1063. The Government intends to contract for services to serve as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and support for a new cooperative agreement project called "Surveillance, Natural History, Quality of Care and Outcomes of Diabetes Mellitus with Onset in Childhood and Adolescence". The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price. The period of performance is anticipated to be a base and four option periods.
<p>The reason for lack of competition is that Wake Forest University is the only organization available to perform the role and responsibilities of data management and data analysis as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) because of the established communication and coordination among the clinical centers and the infrastructure already set up by Wake Forest University for the collection and analysis of genetic, immunologic, pathogen, and clinical and biological data from the clinical sties. Additionally, Wake Forest University has an established Website for the current SEARCH study and for which the new and continuing grantees under the cooperative agreement project will build upon (www.searchfordiabetes.org). Wake Forest University is also responsible for the support of the study protocol and manual of operations and responsible for the logistics of the Steering Committee meetings, external evaluation committee meetings, and workshops meetings.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting, or exceeding the requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement detailing their capability to include past performance information, which will be considered only if received by response deadline contained in this notice. Email capability statements by the deadline to Angelina H. Waring at fwv2@cdc.gov.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to TOMTEC INC, 1000 Sherman Ave, Hamden, CT 06514-1337. The purchase order is for the acquisition of Quadra 4 NS SPE instrument. The (CDC) reasonably believes that competition is impractical because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is a semi automated system which has no equivalent due to its capability, and incorporation into several CDC response methods.<br />2. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is unique because it can perform simplified solid phase extraction for microplate processing in a manner that other systems cannot.<br />3. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is the only semi automated liquid handler that provides the ability to manually and semi automatically process liquid samples in a 96-well format.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authority for sole source procurements is FAR part 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting, or exceeding the requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement detailing their capability to include past performance information, which will be considered only if received by the Contracting Office by 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on May 15, 2010.

<DESC>Defense Supply Center Philadelphia has a requirement for shipping and storage containers for 8 NSNs within FSC 8150. The NSNs are as follows: 1) 8145-01-483-9115, 2) 8145-01-483-9121, 3) 8145-01-483-9123, 4) 8145-01-483-9125, 5) 8145-01-533-8673, 6) 8145-01-533-8674, 7) 8145-01-533-8675, 8) 8145-01-533-8677. DSCP anticipates an Indefinite Quantity Contract with a two year base period and two 1-year options. The total estimated dollar value is $48M (inclusive of options). The contract resulting from this solicitation will be a Fixed Price with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) (05%) and will be conducted under the authority of FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in conjunction with FAR Part 15. This procurement will be a 50% Partial Set-Aside. Vendors will be invited to offer on any or all portions in which they meet the requirements of the solicitation; however, a successful awardee may not receive more than one award as the policy and procedures of FAR Part 6.202, Establishing or Maintaining Alternative Sources, will be utilized if needed. Inspection and Acceptance will take place at Origin and the RFP will be issued on an FOB origin basis. Because exact destinations are not known and it is impracticable to establish tentative or general delivery places for the purpose of evaluating transportation costs, the provision at 52.247-50, No Evaluation of Transportation Costs will be included in the solicitation. This is a DVD contract for both CONUS and OCONUS locations. All 8 item descriptions are brand name or equal citing salient characteristics. The required delivery date will be 60 to 90 days depending on the size of the order. Smaller, high priority orders will require a shorter delivery date. An Add/Delete clause will be included in the solicitation. DFARS 252.225-7020, Trade Agreement Certificate and 252.225-7021, Trade Agreements will be applicable. The solicitation once issued, will be posted onto DIBBS, https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. The anticipated RFP issue date is on or about March 26, 2010. The anticipated award date is on or about June 21, 2010. Address for responses to the RFP will be cited in the solicitation. All responsible sources will be able to submit a proposal which will then be considered by DSCP. This solicitation will allow for two awards (one set-Aside portion and one Unrestricted portion) and the evaluation will be Low Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). The award(s) will be made to the responsible offeror(s) providing a technically acceptable proposal at the lowest evaluated price. For questions or further details please contact Patricia Kniffin, patricia.kniffin@dla.mil or Jeannette Moy, Jeannette.moy@dla.mil.

<DESC>Scope of WorkThis project is to complete the task of installing a historically accurate replicated copper finial and spire on top of the lantern room of the Loggerhead Lighthouse. The Loggerhead Lighthouse is located on Loggerhead Key within the park boundaries of Dry Tortugas National Park which is located 68 miles west of Key West, Florida, Monroe County, FL. The Loggerhead Light is a brick tower standing roughly 150-feet tall that was constructed in 1858. This structure is located within the Historic District known as the Loggerhead Light Station. Loggerhead Key also sits within the Research Natural Area of Dry Tortugas National Park which is an environmentally sensitive area with specific resource protection laws in place, therefore there are no motorized vehicles on the island or available, there is also no fishing and contractors should be conscious of their environmental impact to the location.  Due to the remote location of this structure the prospective bidders will be responsible for delivery and mobilization of all employees, materials, hardware, tools, safety equipment, hoisting apparatus, power supplies, food, water, and all other incidentals; both personal and work related in order to complete this task.
Contractors will need to make arrangements with private services available or the NPS to transport personnel, material, and supplies from Key West to Loggerhead Key.The finial and spire are located in Key West, FL. Contractor should plan on transporting materials, supplies, and equipment from Key West, FL to Loggerhead Key. There may be an option for the NPS to transport the newly fabricated pieces from Key West, to Loggerhead Key.  The contractor should plan for personnel to travel from Key West, FL to Garden Key via one of two commercial ferry services. NPS can transport personnel from Garden Key to Loggerhead Key.
Installation will take place roughly 150-feet in the air on the roof structure of the lighthouse. Therefore, all current OSHA safety standards must be met in securing personnel, tools, and materials. A safety plan should be included with all potential bids. The only access for personnel will be from the exterior of the watch room. There is a ladder that extends from the exterior gallery floor to the top of the lantern roof structure. Materials and equipment can either be carried up the stairs within the lighthouse or hoisted up on the exterior. Some materials will have to be hoisted up the exterior as they will not fit through the openings inside the lighthouse itself. Any hoisting apparatus temporarily mounted must not have any adverse effects on the historic structure of the lighthouse or other buildings in the area.
The new assembly to be installed includes a 16-inch diameter copper pipe with a hole to receive the  1 -inch spire, a copper spherical finial and base, and a stainless steel 1 -inch diameter spire. The copper pipe needs to be installed inside of the spherical finial and attached via a flange at the base to an existing lantern room metal framing rib. The spherical finial will be attached to the existing roof structure at the base which will need to be custom fabricated on-site to fit around the 16 panel rib caps. The spire will be inserted through the spherical finial and interior pipe and bolted (see drawings and photographs). This apparatus will then need to be re-attached to the existing lightening suppression system in place. 
NPS will arrange to schedule lightening grounding contractors to coincide with this project schedule to ensure the new apparatus is correctly attached to the grounding system.
After installation is complete the contractor will be responsible for the removal of all tools, materials, debris (both personal and work related) as well as all personal items from Loggerhead Key and Dry Tortugas National Park.Housing will be provided on Loggerhead Key. There is a small house that has one bedroom available with 2 sets of bunch beds and one bathroom and kitchen with refrigerator, freezer, stove, and oven.  Power will be supplied to run the house amenities but the contractors will need to bring all food, water, and fuel necessary to run their own power generating equipment for work related activities such as running power tools.
Contractors should be prepared to stay out at this remote location for the duration of the project as transportation to and from Garden Key will not be available unless in an emergency situation. There is limited water available on the island and all power is generated by a photovoltaic system. This work site and project should be prepared for as a back country job with no amenities provides whatsoever. There is no telephone or internet service at Loggerhead Key.It is anticipated that this installation will take 4 employees no more than 1 week to complete mobilization, installation, and demobilization.

These site improvements will include: selective demolition for site improvements and new parking lot drain-age and culverts, new asphalt and asphalt overlays, and improved parking layout.Building 2521(also known as Warehouse A) is located along highway 331 in the warehouse area of NSA Crane and is currently occupied by the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division (NSWC).  
The project consists of the re-grading and resurfacing of approximately 18,800 SY of parking lots and sur-rounding paved areas at Building 2521.  Associated storm drainage ditches and structures are also included in the project.  
Demolition on the site is minimal and shall include, but is not limited to:  cold milling of existing asphalt areas within the fence line, removal of the security fence on the eastern and north western sides of the building and the gravel pavement within the fenced area.  The existing gravel parking lot outside of the security fence will have approximately 5" of gravel removed to allow for this area to receive asphalt pavement.  On the eastern and northern sides of the site, 5-15" corrugated metal pipes will be removed.Primary approach to Building 2521 is from Highway 331.  A Privately Owned Vehicle (POV) parking area is required for this improvement project.  This project also requires concrete motorcycle parking which will be located between Buildings 2521 and 3422.  Approximately 300 linear feet of chain-link fencing will be in-stalled.Within the existing fence line, gravel areas will be re-compacted and receive a 3-inch base course with a 2-inch asphalt surface course.  Per user request, grassed areas were added on the southern and eastern sides of the site.  However, to allow for delivery trucks to have access to doors 8 and 13, 100-foot wide paved turnaround areas were added in front of these doors.  Existing paved areas will receive a minimum of 2-inches of asphalt surface course.  At the location of the existing train tracks, a full-depth asphalt pavement will be constructed.Outside of the existing fence line, a minimum of 2-inches of asphalt surface course and new pavement markings will be applied to the existing asphalt POV parking lots.  The existing gravel POV lot will receive a 3-inch base course with a 2-inch asphalt surface course.All paved areas shall have a minimum slope of 1%.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<DESC>FA4890-10-R-0009<br />REMOTELY PILOTED AIRCRAFT (RPA)<br />SOURCES SOUGHT/MARKET RESEARCH<br />
<p>The government is considering a combined MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper organizational-level maintenance contract starting on/about 1 October 2011 and is seeking industry input on how best to support Air Combat Command's remotely piloted aircraft missions. Support will consist of aircraft, ground control station, and Predator Primary Satellite Link maintenance, weapons loading for both aircraft, munitions build-up for MQ-9 aircraft only, and logistics support for both aircraft to include aerospace ground equipment, tool room, parts ordering, custodial responsibilities for parts and equipment, and Plans and Scheduling responsibilities. Initial plans (subject to change) call for support at multiple deployed locations as shown below. Deployed locations may be combined MQ-1/MQ-9 efforts or stand-alone for each weapons system. Specific locations and exact timing of each location is TBD and the actual number of locations will be dictated by future mission requirements. The level-of-effort will be determined on a "sortie and flying-hour" basis with an allowance for attrition. We expect some level of personnel rotations at the deployed sites, however, are not tied to a specific amount at this time.</p>

<p>** Planned # of sorties is spread across all locations</p>
<p>We are seeking specific industry feedback on the potential for minimizing CONUS support of MQ-1 &amp; MQ-9. If CONUS contractor-supported flying is minimized or unavailable, what options are available to train and maintain proficiency for contractor personnel required to support the deployed mission? If some level of CONUS effort is required to adequately support the deployed effort, provide a recommended minimum sortie/flying hour requirement that will fulfill contractor training/proficiency requirements and justification for proposed CONUS support.<br /><br />We are also soliciting industry feedback regarding the price structure for the deployed efforts. Is it feasible to solicit OCONUS on a firm fixed price basis? What kind of workload data is required to facilitate soliciting on fixed price basis?</p>
<p>Request industry e-mail responses by 14 May 2010 to Donna Rankin, donna.rankin@langley.af.mil, Mark Garrette, mark.garrette@langley.af.mil, and Sharon Potter, sharon.potter@langley.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<BR>This is a request for information (RFI) only.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  All information received will be for planning purposes only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.  All proprietary information shall be marked as such.  The U.S. Army is seeking the availability and technical capability of qualified sources to provide improvements to the current Flame Resistant Army Combat Shirt (FR-ACS).<BR><BR>The Improved Army Combat Shirt (IACS) capabilities are needed to improve soldier survivability and operational capabilities in all operational environments.  The IACS will support major combat operations, stability operations, homeland security operations, and joint operating concepts, as well as the joint force application functional concepts.  The IACS will provide soldiers the enhanced capability to remain mission capable and continue the mission without negative physiological effects due to the environment or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) being worn.  The IACS provides a capability for longer wear of the PPE due to its ability to act as a protective barrier to the PPE, preventing chafing and rubbing on the soldier from the PPE itself.  In hot environments, the IACS provides an enhanced capability for heat mitigation by reducing the number of layers soldiers must wear and providing a more comfortable shirt for wear under the PPE.  In cold environments, it will have the reverse effect, keeping soldiers warmer, and reducing the layers of clothing needed to keep them warm while wearing the PPE.<BR><BR>REQUIREMENTS:<BR>The performance parameters for the IACS are as follows:<BR><BR>Physical Protection: The IACS shall not melt or drip when exposed to flame and it shall be self extinguishing.  As a worn flame resistant clothing item, the IACS shall be subject to independent verification testing in accordance with ASTM F1930, Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Flame Resistant Clothing for Protection Against Flash Fire Simulations Using an Instrumented Manikin, using a 4 second exposure.  Additionally, the IACS shall be subject to the same physical protection standards and testing stated in the current Army Combat Shirt Purchase Description, GL-PD-10-02, dated 23 December, 2009.<BR><BR>The IACS shall cover the upper torso and full length of the arms to the wrist.  It shall be compatible with and compliment all other equipment and items issued to the soldier as individual equipment or PPE.  It shall provide enhanced flame protection in those areas of the uniform not covered by the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV) and/or Plate Carrier body armor vest; this ensures each piece of soldier equipment or clothing, current and future will be an integrated component of the total system and allow the soldier to tailor clothing and personal equipment according to the mission.<BR><BR>Wear and Comfort: The IACS shall not hinder the soldiers full range of motion while wearing the shirt.  The IACS shall not limit any natural physical capability of the soldier while completing individual or collective tasks.<BR><BR>The IACS shall be capable of quick donning and doffing, and shall not restrict soldiers as they don or doff personal equipment or PPE.<BR><BR>The IACS shall be non-irritating to the skin of the soldier; it shall not cause distraction to soldiers resulting from irritation.  Optimally, the FR-ACS shall not chafe the soldier.<BR><BR>Heat Mitigation: IACS shall provide a heat reduction capability; it shall allow for ventilation of body heat.  The IACS shall also be capable of retaining body heat during cold weather operations.<BR><BR>Durability: The IACS shall resist ripping or tearing; it shall be water and wind resistant; and it shall resist staining from contact with common molds and fungus, petroleum, oils, and lubricant products, tars, and  surfactants.  The shirt shall require minimum care and maintenance and shall maintain its protective properties through 50 launderings.  Optimally, the shirt shall provide an electrostatic discharge capability in order to be used with the Army Aircrew Combat Uniform (A2CU) trousers during missions involving rotary wing aircraft.<BR><BR>Sustainment: The IACS shall provide a minimum service life of 120 days of field use and minimum shelf life of five (5) years; the optimal service life is 180 days of field use and optimal shelf life is more than five (5) years.<BR><BR>ADDITIONAL DESIRABLE CHARACTERISTICS:<BR>Force Protection: The IACS shall provide a reduction in infrared (IR) signature commensurate with other current Army combat uniforms.<BR><BR>Physical Protection: The IACS shall provide additional protection at crucial points on the body of the soldier that are supporting PPE or subject to increased frequency of being struck by the ground or other non-ballistic objects.<BR><BR>The IACS shall provide protection from insect borne diseases.<BR><BR>Identification: The IACS shall provide the capability to identify soldiers by name, rank, and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) tag.<BR><BR>Convenience: The IACS shall provide the capability to carry writing utensils and other small articles on the sleeves.<BR><BR>INFORMATION SOUGHT: Potential offerors are invited to describe their capabilities to provide the product as described herein.  All respondents shall include all of the information listed below in an email to jed.watkins@us.army.mil and phillip-blue@conus.army.mil, and limit their responses to no more than 10 pages.<BR><BR>1)	Company name and Solicitation number in the email subject line.<BR>2)	Company address, telephone number, primary contact(s) with e-mail address(es), NAICS code(s), business size (i.e., small/large/HUB Zone), CAGE code, and DUNS number.  (Respondents must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database in order to obtain a DUNS number.  Firms may register with CCR at http://www.ccr.gov.)<BR>3)	Statement of capability demonstrating background, experience, skills, ability and availability to fulfill the Government's requirements described herein, to include recommended improvements.  This can also include current or past performance of providing this or similar products to the Government.<BR>4)	Estimated cost, typical delivery schedule, and anticipated volume discounts.<BR>5)	If applicable, a description of currently available commercial products, as well as the ability to modify existing products or develop new products that could meet the requirements described herein.<BR>6)	All assumptions, including any assumed Government support.<BR><BR>All information shall be submitted within 15 days following the publication of this RFI.<BR><BR>Address any questions about this request for information to Phillip Blue at phillip-blue@conus.army.mil or U.S. Army PM SCIE, 5981 13th Street Bldg 1155, ATTN: Phillip Blue, Fort Belvoir VA, 22060.<BR><BR>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.  The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.  Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

Information provided as a response to the RFI will not be returned. AFMESA will not entertain any questions concerning the composition, requirements, or the nature of services to be performed under any future request for proposal (RFP).<br />3. BACKGROUND: The Office of the Air Force Surgeon General (AFMSA/SG5R) has identified a need for a CS monitoring device that will enhance the Air Force Medical Service's (AFMS) ability to provide a higher and standardized level of care for patients during AE missions undertaken by Critical Care Air Transport Teams (CCATT). The CCATT is a three-person, highly specialized medical team that operates a portable intensive care unit in an aircraft during flight. The CCATT is a limited, rapidly deployable resource and a primary component of the Air Force's AE system. <br />Reducing the medical footprint in theater drives the movement of critically ill patients sooner, resulting in the need for CCATT to monitor and possibly treat more patients while en-route to a higher level of care. The CS monitoring device being sought will increase medical certainties and capabilities in the forward care operating locations that can result in saving the limbs and preventing permanent muscle damage to the warfighters. <br />4.

<SUBJECT>Field Evaluation of Double Crossover Diamond Interchanges
<SOLNBR>DTFH61-10-R-00018
<RESPDATE>031710
<CONTACT>Lise S. Lyles, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-4229, Fax 202-366-3705, Email lise.lyles@dot.gov - Rick Murray, Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 366-4250, Fax (202) 366-3705, Email rick.murray@dot.gov
<DESC>Potential Sources Sought. This is not an RFP. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is conducting as market survey to identify potential sources that can provide the technical expertise for field evaluation of double crossover diamond interchanges (DCD) in accordance with the Scope of Work herein.
<p>Background</p>
<p>Many in-service diamond interchanges are approaching or have exceeded their design traffic capacity. Some sit at strategic locations on the local freeway and major arterial network. Congestion at these locations can create bottle necks that deteriorate the level of service for a large portion of the area transportation network. There is an urgent need to upgrade the traffic carrying capacity of these interchanges to alleviate congestion and improve air quality, not only locally but also system wide.</p>
<p>Increasing interchange throughput can be accomplished by adding lanes or replacing interchanges. These are major construction projects that are typically high cost. Throughput can also be achieved through the combination of innovative channelization, signing, and signal timing, which requires intimate knowledge of the traffic pattern at the site of interest, but can be done at much lower cost. We define the latter as non-conventional approaches. Non-conventional approaches capable of delivering the same level of capacity increase, but at significantly lower costs, are expected to gain more and more attention as DOTs seek to provide the best level of service at the lowest cost to the public.</p>
<p>One such non-conventional approach is the double crossover diamond interchange (DCD) also known as diverging diamond interchange (DDI). It was originated and first implemented in France. The idea is to combine the left turn and through traffic, thereby eliminating the need for a left turn lane and protected left turn phase. A DCD channelizes vehicular traffic on a grade separated crossroad from the right side of the road to the left side at the first ramp terminal, and channelizes the traffic back to the right side at the second ramp terminal. Within the two ramp terminals, the left turning traffic moves with the through traffic, and can enter the freeway without restriction. A DCD utilizes the entire length of the freeway overpass or underpass as storage space for left turning traffic entering the freeway. It is estimated that reducing the number of signal phases and allowing left turn and through traffic to move simultaneously during the green phase will increase the interchange throughput, and reduce crashes by reducing the number of conflict points. According to FHWA research, the DCD design increases capacity up to 30%. A DCD is especially suitable when left-turn volumes are high and opposing traffic on the crossroad is unbalanced.</p>
<p>In the United States, the first diamond interchange converted to DCD is located at I-44 &amp; US13 in Springfield, MO. It was opened to traffic in June, 2009. Two DCDs - Route 60 &amp; National Ave. in Springfield, MO, and I-15 &amp; Main St in American Fork, UT, are currently under construction and planned to open to traffic in late summer or fall of 2010. Three additional DCDs, I-270 &amp; Dorsett Rd in St. Louis, Mo, I-435 &amp; Front Street in Kansas City, MO, and I-590 &amp; Winton Rd in Rochester, NY, are planned for construction in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>Definition</p>
<p>In this statement of work, before period is the time frame of at least one month prior to the start of construction or major preparation work at a DCD site that results in changes to the traffic pattern; transition period is the time frame between 0 to 3 months after a DCD has been fully open to traffic; and after period is the time frame after a DCD has been fully open to traffic for 3 months.</p>
<p>Note: Fully open to traffic means all types of construction equipment are removed, all traffic signs and pavement markings are in place, and there are no signs of work zone.</p>
<p>Special Notes to Offerors</p>
<p>In this statement of work, various types of data collection needs are described. These data elements are to be used in conducting practical and objective field evaluation of the operational and safety impacts of DCD. The offerors are encouraged to propose more or less, or alternative types of data collection needs, and explain the reason(s) in support of the proposed evaluation methodology.</p>
<p>When proposing specific types of data collection technologies to meet the evaluation needs, the offerors are advised to think carefully about how each type of data will be collected and used, team members' experience with the proposed equipment, the level of R&amp;D work needed to ready the data collection system, and especially the level of labor effort required to reduce and archive each type of data. The general direction is to collect the right amount of data at the right locations during the right periods of time.</p>
<p>For crash data collection, reference sites are required to provide a baseline of the local crash trends. The number of reference sites proposed may impact the proposed budget. The offerors should balance the needs of accuracy and cost when proposing the required number of reference sites for each DCD.<br />Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives of this contract are to evaluate the operational and safety impacts of converting an existing diamond interchange into a DCD through before and after study, and investigate how accurately the field observed traffic conditions at the DCD sites can be replicated in microscopic simulation in VISSIM.</p>
<p>Scope</p>

 JT-TRAINING/JB
TEM APPLICATIONS SUPPORT FOR SERIAL EM
Installation support and training of SerialEM and IMOD for a total of 1 week (5 business days including travel)

1. The system must have field emission illumination, a range of accelerating voltages up to 200 kV, an in-column energy filter, a phase plate, a TV rate camera and a 2k x 2k CCD camera with TV rate readout. The microscope must also be compatible with a Gatan 4k x 4k Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera. The following are more detailed specifications.

2. Electron Optical Specifications

Accelerating Voltage. The microscope will have an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, with semi-continuous control (50V steps or smaller).

Field Emission Source. The microscope must employ a field emission gun (FEG) as its electron source with a Schottky field emitter. Beam current shall be 0.5 nA or better in a 1 nm probe (measured at FWHM).

Coherence and Instrumental Resolution. Point-to-point resolution, under cryo low dose conditions (LN2 temperature, 10  20 e/2 total dose in a half-second exposure, ~1 m defocus), at 200kV and ~60kx magnification will be demonstrated with and without phase plate by Fourier analysis of digitized film-recorded micrographs of a thin carbon film. The micrographs will be digitized and diffraction patterns calculated and rotationally averaged. Thon fringes of significant intensity should extend to 3.3  or better. The 2D transforms will be used to check that the resolution is the same in all directions.

Zernike Phase Plate. The microscope will come equipped with a Zernike phase plate located in the back focal plane of the microscopes objective lens and produce a phase shift of &#960;/2 radians for scattered electrons compared to the unscattered beam. The cryopolepiece must accommodate the phase plate holder at the back focal plane as well as an in-lens objective aperture. At least three phase plate discs will be supplied with the instrument, each consisting of 25 or more individual phase plates. The phase plate holder must hold at least three phase plate discs and include fully adjustable heating elements to maintain the phase plate at a selected temperature in the range of room temperature to 250 C in order to reduce contamination. A motorized and computer-controlled goniometer will be supplied to accept the holder and allow precision positioning of the phase plate. A turbomolecular-pumped airlock will be included for exchanging phase plate discs in and out of the column vacuum. A commercial source must exist for the phase plates, as they are a consumable item.

In-column Omega-type Energy Filter. An automated, computer-controlled in-column omega-type energy filter must be included and allow the same wide range of magnifications (50x-1,000,000x) as used in conventional transmission electron microscope mode. Distortion in the image-formation lens system must be less than 1.5% length difference of lattice vectors across the field of view of the film and 10 eV across the same plane for energy spread.

Parallel Illumination. A condenser mini-lens should be supplied that can be controlled independently of the objective lens in order to obtain parallel illumination under a wide range of conditions.

Rotation-free Imaging System. The lens system should be configured to prevent image rotation when the magnification is changed.

Free Lens Control. All optical functions of the microscope will be independently controlled, including all lenses, stigmators, and alignment coils. Once set, these conditions can be saved and recalled.

Apertures. All apertures should be motor-driven and computer-controlled.

Stage Specifications

Goniometer. The stage must be motorized and computer-controlled, with a eucentric goniometer and have at least 70 of continuous tilt, unhindered by the pole pieces or anticontaminator, when using a Gatan Model 914 cryoholder. The goniometer must be able to return to within 2 m of a stored position when recalled by the operator. The stage must have piezoelectric elements which allow an X,Y-motion of 0.4 m or more with a step size of approximately 0.04 nm that can be used for specimen micro positioning and drift compensation.

Eucentricity. Eucentricity must be achievable with all holders. When observing an in-focus object at X = Y = 0, tilting across the full tilt range (in either direction) should yield a deviation in the X and Y position of the object of less than 1.5 m during the entire operation.

Mechanical and Thermal Stability. With a cryoholder at its minimum temperature and within two minutes of the last stage movement, the drift rate, without electronic drift compensation, should be < 5 /min at 0 tilt, < 10 /min at 30 tilt, < 15 /min at 45 tilt, and < 25 /min at 70 tilt.

Vacuum System Specifications

Vacuum System. The vacuum system should be fully automatic and differentially pumped using turbo-molecular, sputter ion, and diffusion pumps.

Specimen Airlock. The specimen rod will have double o-ring seals, with the volume between the o-rings continuously pumped during airlock prepump. With a prepump of 1-3 minutes and a fully filled cryo trap, the microscope vacuum will recover to its original value within 15 seconds of specimen insertion.

Anticontaminator. A cryo box anticontaminator must be an integral part of the cryopolepiece. The anticontaminator will maintain a temperature of 185C or lower and effectively trap extraneous ice contamination. It must not diminish tilt range or resolution in any way. The ice contamination rate of a cryo specimen should be less than 5 /hour.

3. Additional Hardware and Compatibility

Specimen Holders. A Gatan Model 914 High Tilt Liquid Nitrogen Cryo Transfer Tomography Holder will be provided along with standard single- and double-tilt room temperature holders.

Cameras. The microscope must come equipped with a high resolution CCD/TV camera for routine viewing and a 2k x 2k CCD camera with TV readout speed (30fps or more at 4x binning or less) suitable for focusing and stigmation adjustments. Furthermore, the microscope must be compatible with a Gatan 4k x 4k Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera.

4. Software

Software will be supplied for the general operation, control, and use of the microscope. Additionally, software for cryo-electron tomography as well as cryo-electron microscopy applications will be provided. At minimum, this should include a low-dose mode (which employs electromagnetic beam/image shifting to provide search, focus/tracking, and exposure modes along with appropriate beam blanking) and automated tilt-series acquisition software (such as SerialEM). As they become available, the vendor will supply free revisions and upgrades to their software products, core control software, and plug-ins required to operate the instrument. This will include existing and future software related to the phase plate and tomography.

5. Measurement of Electron Dose

The electron dose must be calibrated with a Faraday cup or equivalent method between doses of 0.01 and 120 electrons/2, and be read on a display or determined from counts per pixel on the CCD cameras, or other electron dose measurement capabilities equivalent in accuracy and convenience must be provided.

6. Uptime

Microscope uptime should be 95% or greater and guaranteed by the vendor.


Delivery Date  10 months after receipt of purchase order.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 112990 with a size standard of $0.75M.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Notice must have the capabilities to provide research dogs that meet the qualifications described below.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking information related to the interest and capacity of small businesses, private companies, foundations, and academic institutions to breed and raise research canines that have specific characteristics necessary for NIH-supported research activities that are currently obtained through Class B dealers.&nbsp; A requirement that is to follow will be to supply research animals from sources alternative to Class B dealers.</p>
<p>NIH-supported researchers study basic biological processes and a wide range of diseases, thus expanding our knowledge of the origins and causes of disease.&nbsp; Many medical advances that enhance the lives of both humans and animals originate from animal studies. The types of animals used in research are chosen for their similarity to humans in anatomy, physiology, and/or genetics.&nbsp; This research can lead to insights into how to prevent, treat, and cure human diseases, and often the treatments developed can also be used to improve the health of animals.</p>
<p>Most dogs used in biomedical research are either "purpose-bred" for research by licensed commercial breeders (Class A dealers), or bred and raised in research colonies.&nbsp; Some research dogs and cats, commonly referred to as "random source" animals, are provided by licensed Class B dealers.&nbsp; These dealers acquire dogs and cats from random sources such as individual owners, small hobby breeders, and pounds and shelters.&nbsp; The public has expressed concern about the humane treatment of animals acquired for use in biomedical research, particularly that of random source dogs that are obtained from pounds and shelters and may have come from the general pet population.</p>
<p>The use of random source animals in NIH-funded research is limited; however, the genetic variability and phenotypic characteristics of random source animals are essential for continued scientific progress in several critical health areas. For example, these animals are often larger and/or older animals (especially useful for the study of heart disease).&nbsp; In some chronic cardiovascular studies, highly instrumented dogs are needed to run on a treadmill.&nbsp; These studies require a very tractable, mature dog, which given the level of instrumentation, should be large and broad-chested animals.&nbsp; Tractability and maturity in research animals are necessary for at least two reasons:&nbsp; (1) when instruments are placed in young animals they are likely to move and be displaced as the animals grow and mature; and, (2) immature and poor social behavior in young animals is more difficult to condition to research protocols.&nbsp; Most Class A bred dogs are sold at 6 - 7 months of age; and mature by approximately 2 years of age.&nbsp; Additionally, the blood volume of small, immature animals severely limits the amount of blood that can be sampled for chronic longitudinal hemodynamic and neurohormonal studies.</p>
<p>The most common NIH-supported studies that require animals with the characteristics described above are related to cardiovascular and transplant research.&nbsp; Other projects include, but are not limited to, diabetes and studies of the skeletal system.&nbsp; At this time, Class A dealers report having limited additional animals available with the genetic diversity, conformation, size, age and temperament necessary for these types of research.&nbsp; Thus, without access to animals with these characteristics, vital research could be discontinued and potentially jeopardize breakthroughs necessary for improving human health.</p>
<p>The NIH is assessing alternative sources for dogs currently supplied to NIH-researchers by Class B dealers.&nbsp; Supplementing Class A breeders appears to be a possible option for providing a guaranteed source of animals comparable to those historically provided by Class B random source dealers.&nbsp; Other entities may also have the ability to breed and raise, to maturity, dogs that are large (approximately 25-35 kg.), short haired, barrel-chested, out-bred hounds or mongrels that are socialized and tractable.&nbsp; The NIH is interested in identifying multiple sources of these research animals, with a total capacity for providing 1,100 dogs/year.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the NIH, requests capability statements from entities including, but not limited to, small businesses, private companies, foundations, and academic institutions, that will not fall within the Class B Dealer category, interested in supplying research dogs that meet the above qualifications.&nbsp; In addition to capability statements, the NIH is interested in the following information:</p>
<p>1) Estimate of currently available research canines that are mature, large (approximately 25-35 kg.), short haired, barrel-chested, out-bred hounds or mongrels that are socialized and tractable. Estimate of annual number of canines that could be supplied, on an ongoing basis, over the next three to four years; <br />2) Current availability of infrastructure/facilities necessary to breed, whelp, raise, house and supply these types of animals and estimate of how many animals could be accommodated; <br />3) Current availability of infrastructure/facilities and staff necessary to socialize and train dogs so that they will be tractable for research studies; <br />4) Source of veterinary care and manner by which animal welfare oversight will be assured;<br />5) If facilities are not currently available, the timeline and estimated cost for construction of facilities that would support in 3 - 4 years between 250-400 animals per year, per vendor;<br />6) Estimate of cost per animal for a mature, large (approximately 25-35 kg.), short haired, barrel-chested, out-bred hounds or mongrels that are socialized and tractable over a 3-4 year time course broken down by year; <br />7) Current USDA dealer status; and,<br />8) Any other information that you may deem relevant to this issue.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.&nbsp; All proprietary information should be marked as such.&nbsp; Statements should also include an indication of current certified small business status; this indication should be clearly marked on the first page of the capability statement (preferably placed under the eligible small business concern's name and address).&nbsp; Responses will be reviewed only by NIH personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10: MARKET RESEARCH. This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the United States (U.S) Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. At this time, proprietary information is not being requested, and respondents shall refrain from providing proprietary information in response to this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.</p>
<p>SCOPE: <br />The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is searching for vendors interested and capable of manufacturing and delivering Skiff Ice Boat (SKF-ICE) for the USCG (see the attached draft specification).</p>
<p>The SKF-ICE will be used as a Short-Haul deployment craft (i.e. for ice rescue SAR cases where the response is less than one-half of a nautical mile from shore). The standard response is a three-person rescue team that travels to the nearest point on shore adjacent to the distress location, and traverses onto the ice for the purpose of conducting a rescue. The ice rescue team is assisted by at least one shoreside member for communications relay. The general case response involves the ice rescue team walking to the location of distress and conducting recovery using a shuttle board and approved rescue slings. The shuttle board is also typically used to help transport gear of the rescue team and assist with victim transport over ice back to shore. A timely response may also necessitate transiting small open pools of water or cracks between ice shelves in which the ice rescue team may need to transit these small areas in order to conduct a timely rescue. The proposed platform needs to be able to support the ice rescue team transit these small areas of open water and also assist with survivor recovery.</p>

<p>C. A rough estimate for the boat concerning production timeframe and price ranges.</p>
<p>D. (1) Business Size in accordance with NAICS Code 336612. The expression of interest should state whether the concern is a Large or Small Business, and identify if Small Business Disadvantaged Business, HUB-Zone Business, Women Owned Business, 8(a) certified small business, Veteran Owned Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and business size under the potential NAICS, <br />(2) Dun and Bradstreet number, <br />(3) Any other Government contracts held including General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule (include the GSA schedule number), and <br />(4) If your firm has recently submitted a proposal for any similar requirements with any Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, or other U.S Federal Government activities, please indicate this with your submission to include agency's name, solicitation number, and Contracting Officer's name and point of contact information.</p>

<DESC>AIRCRAFT LEASING / AIR CHARTER<BR>The U.S. Marshals Service, Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (USMS-JPATS) is hereby soliciting potential sources, capabilities, and ideas, in connection with a potential JPATS requirement to fulfill its prisoner/detainee aircraft transportation mission.  JPATS operates a fleet of large transport aircraft to transport prisoners and criminal aliens throughout the United States and to selected countries in Latin America.  The aircraft are operated and maintained to the standards of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91 and are based at three locations Oklahoma City, OK; Alexandria, LA; and Mesa, AZ.  
This is a market survey/sources sought for informational purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal.  Currently, there is no solicitation document available; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail to Arlene Dee Carlson, Contracting Officer, at arlene.carlson@usdoj.gov by 12:00 pm (noon) EST May 11, 2010.  
JPATS is soliciting interest and ideas in connection with how JPATS might best meet its mission utilizing six mid-life to late model aircraft to service all three locations whether it be through one contract covering all three areas or two or three separate contracts (one covering Oklahoma City and either one or two covering both Alexandria and Mesa).  Each location is currently serviced by two (2) MD-83 aircraft.  Any new prospective JPATS requirement would require the contractor to provide only aircraft of a U.S. Registry with a valid FAA issued Standard Certificate of Airworthiness with passenger seating capacity of not less than 156.  Any prospective JPATS requirement would most likely necessitate this general range and payload or greater.
JPATS is interested in considering all available options to meet its requirements, including dry leasing, wet leasing, or a combination of wet and dry leases of aircraft.  Other specific information of interest is as follows:
The type of large aircraft the source has available for a dry lease;
The type of large aircraft the source has available for a wet lease;
Whether a standardized fleet of six to eight aircraft in either a dry or wet lease scenario is feasible;
Whether eliminating a requirement for a standardized fleet for dry lease purposes would have an impact on estimated pricing, and if so how;
The significance, if any, in terms of estimated pricing (per flight hour and monthly), interest, capability, etc., from the source's perspective if JPATS were to break out any potential requirement to be encompassed in three different contracts covering the three locations (Oklahoma City, Alexandria, Mesa) with approximately two aircraft for each location;
If the source would have the capability/interest in proposing a mixture of dry lease and wet lease aircraft and if so, how such a arrangement could potentially operate and whether it would be advantageous with explanations behind such rationale;
The estimated pricing on a flight per hour basis and monthly basis per aircraft in a dry lease arrangement, a wet lease arrangement, and/or a mixture of both; 
If the available aircraft (both wet and dry), the timing of when it would be available and, with a wet lease, if and when the vendor would want the aircraft to be unavailable;	The current plans, if any, that a source might have for acquiring additional aircraft and if so, what type of aircraft and whether such fact would have an impact in a sources interest in a possible JPATS requirement;
The significance, if any, in terms of estimated pricing (both flight per hour and monthly), interest, capability, willingness to engage in dry leases or wet leases, etc., from the sources perspective if JPATS were to formulate a requirement to cover a multi-year base requirement on the contract (e.g. 2 to 5 years) as opposed to one base year, both with successive options;
The detailed capabilities and ability to provide maintenance support for the aircraft fleet and the impact, if any, in maintenance if three separate requirements (covering approximately two aircraft each) for each JPATS location was created as opposed to one requirement for all three JPATS locations;
Are there provisions in the current long-term lease that made it less attractive;
The level of interest in this potential requirement; and	Any other information or data that JPATS should know about in connection with a particular companys capabilities or requirements as it considers what next steps, if any, JPATS should take in formulating a potential future requirement.

<p>The follow-on effort's source selection will not be completed by 9 May 2010, the end date of the current period of performance.

<DESC>RECOVERY - CMS intends to award a Task Order under its contract HHSM-500-2010-00001I for Medicaid Analytic Extracts (MAX) Data Warehouse to Support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). MAX data are person-level data files on Medicaid eligibility, service utilization and payment information. MAX transforms the state-submitted Medicaid and CHIP data into individual-level use and cost research-ready data in five file types: Personal Summary (including eligibility), Inpatient Hospital, Long-Term Care (institutional services), Pharmacy, and Other Services (physician services, therapies, DME, and community long-term care services). <br /><br />MAX Data Warehouse objectives:<br />&bull; Establish a MAX data warehouse and load MAX 1999-2006 data.<br />&bull; Add additional years of MAX data as they become available.<br />&bull; Build a data extraction system to deliver customized MAX data extract files with minimum data necessary to the research community. <br />&bull; Support CER researchers by providing MAX data.<br /><br />MAX files are a version of the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) data for researchers. When fully populated, MAX files combine demographic and claims data from all States to reveal a more optimal picture of activity in and across states that cannot be accomplished through MSIS-submitted data alone without considerable ad hoc data processing. By merging demographic and claims information, and other means of transforming the data, CMS and external data users conduct a variety of studies pertaining to health services research and policy development. The MAX data are an extremely important data source for a number of important CMS research and policy analysis activities. Other Federal agencies and approved users also rely on the MAX database for research and policy analysis related to Medicaid populations. Studies based on these data continue to contribute to empirical research on the impact of the Medicaid and CHIP and contribute to health care policy development presently and, as intended, for the future. The period of performance is twenty-four months.<br /><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security/ Federal Emergency Management Agency (DHS/ FEMA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 6.302) with International Association of Fire Chiefs, Inc. (IAFC), 4025 Fair Ridge Dr # 300, Fairfax, VA 22033-2865 as the only responsible source that can provide the services to identify, recruit and facilitate group participation from the nine major US fire service organizations to validate and/or modify the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program priorities and criteria and to assist the AFG program in the development of annual rating and evaluation criteria for the Fiscal Year 2010 grant cycle as required by the Grants Program Directorate, Assistance to Firefighters Grants office.<br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /><br style="mso-special-character: line-break" /></p>
<p>The services required are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All existing and potential criteria should be matched against the goals and objectives of DHS and FEMA and revised to improve achievement of those goals, if warranted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Framework and content of all criteria for FY 2010 will include, at a minimum:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Modification of existing priorities, criteria, definitions, and characteristics as necessary, for non-fire-based EMS/Rescue departments;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Modification of existing priorities, criteria, definitions, and characteristics as necessary, with a specific examination of the criteria and priorities for fire departments in rural, suburban, and urban areas;</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Consider appropriate limitations on equipment requests with respect to a department's capabilities;</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Identification of strategies to enhance fire service participation in fire prevention activities;</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Consider appropriate implementation of proposed strategy that will use risk-based, tiered categories of "baseline" service and response capabilities for fire and EMS organizations to identify an organization's "baseline" needs; </li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Provide comment on the proposed AFG strategic plan and the associated technical committee report.</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Continued improvement of definition and articulation of ineligible costs (but not to supersede relevant OMB rules and guidelines); and</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Other program parameters that may emerge, such as feedback from OMB and information pertaining to the program's anticipated reauthorization by Congress.</li>
</ul>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important that this criteria development group be comprised from representatives from the major fire service organizations (recommend three from each organization).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Representatives should be associated with the following organizations:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC), National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM), International Association of Arson Investigators (IAAI), International Society of Fire Service Instructors (ISFSI), North American Fire Training Directors (NAFTD), and Congressional Fire Service Institute (CFSI). As such, we will provide the contractor with a list of State representatives and alternates that should also be included in this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is important that both fresh thinking and experienced thinking be placed into the development of each year's rating criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a mix of individuals that participated in previous criteria development and individuals knowledgeable about the fire service (yet new to the criteria formulation process) be involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is imperative that every effort is made to enlist participants who hold leadership positions and/or have a broad range of experience in fire, EMS, training/education, and/or fire prevention as well as a working knowledge about the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in previous criteria development sessions, members of the various participating fire service organizations shall be provided with the opportunity to communicate their organization's activity priorities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The final report shall include detail regarding the recommended priorities along with the assigned numerical values and formulas, as appropriate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A consensus is not required, but in those cases where agreement is not present amongst all participants, the final report shall record and detail the various objections from the representative(s) of the respective organization or organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to be in a position to implement the 2011 program early in the fiscal year, the criteria development meeting (Meeting A) is scheduled to occur in late September 2010 and, at the discretion of the COTR, convene a follow up meeting (Meeting B) within the second quarter of FY 2011 to assess the effectiveness of the program and any changes made to the program as a result of meeting A, and recommend potential changes for future program direction based in part on OMB feedback and the anticipated reauthorization of the AFG by Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>DHS/FEMA will secure meeting space and lodging for all participants as well as contractor staff and facilitators at a location within the U.S. yet to be determined, at no cost to the contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the government will provide computers, printers and projectors, the contractor will be responsible for all ancillary materials and equipment required to complete the requirements of this project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><br />This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Standards Services Division, intends to negotiate with State Net.; Sacramento, CA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide a specialized legislation and regulations information service.<br /><br />In order to comply with NIST counsel recommendation (May 2004) and in order to fulfill the United States' World Trade Organization (WTO) Member obligation under the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (TBT), NIST-NCSCI (acting in its capacity as the U.S. WTO TBT Notification Authority) is required to notify the World Trade Organization of changes in U.S. technical regulations and conformity assessment rules at the Federal and sub-Federal (State) level. To fulfill this obligation, NCSCI proposes to purchase a specialized legislation and regulations information service, StateNet, to monitor, process, and transmit proposed State regulations from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. <br /><br />Market research has shown that State Net is the only known capable provider of a tool that can satisfy the needs of NIST. The following specifications/features of the "State Net" tool make it the only capable solution for state-level monitoring:<br /><br />-Capable of monitoring over 60 websites daily. Although some states provide electronic access to regulatory information, over 60 websites would need to be monitored daily for state regulatory information.<br />- Provides a vendor consultant for daily systematic review, identification and updates on the most important issues to the user agency.<br />- Capable of monitoring all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Register<br />-Service is Internet-based with unlimited access<br />- Contains full texts of all regulations<br />- Updated daily<br />- Is searchable<br />- Offers customized issue screening and reporting. Customized issue screening and reporting is required due to the volume of materials required for review. It is more cost effective for NCSCI to procure the screening and reporting services than to have NIST staff perform the work.
<p><br />Based on recent market research, State Net is the only known&nbsp;tool that can provide a legislative and regulatory service that currently provides the required screening and reporting services, in addition to customer access to the database that meet the required specifications.</p>
<p><br />The NAICS Code for this requirement is 519130 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to State Net for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements in full listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage serves as an alternative if the FBO website is unavailable.

Request for Information:  This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.  NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane requests MARKET SURVEY information relative to a High Energy Density Systems (HEDS) Roadmap, which includes future technologies research and development (R&D), demonstrations, production plans, and readiness level timelines for airborne, sea, and land-based military applications in the following energy/power based areas:  Lithium Based Batteries, Other Electrochemical Batteries, Capacitive Storage, Fuel Cells, Advanced Energy Conversion/Power Systems, Packaging/Systemization, Energy Systems Management/Control, Advanced Applications Technology, and Safety/Risk.
Respond to this RFI by submitting one or more white papers as described below and by indicating your willingness to participate in a one-week workshop.
The objective of the project is to produce a strategic roadmap with key technological elements that will communicate the technology options for high energy density systems over a future timeframe.  The roadmap will be a tool for planning highly effective, safe, affordable high energy density systems (HEDS) for Navy systems.  Scope - HEDS used in U.S. Navy systems above the size of personnel-carried systems and below primary propulsion for ships.
Items under consideration in the roadmapping process:	Competitive Position	Pervasive Competencies	Systemic Challenges	Technology, Applications/Capability Timelines	Allied (companion, enabling) Technology Timelines	New knowledge/tradecraft requirements	Risk (including Safety/Heat)	Total Ownership Cost High Level	Dependencies	Drivers	Key Enablers/Impacts	Technology Gaps	Science & Technology Brickwalls	Critical Success Factors/Dependencies	Critical Success Factor Futures	Insights
Information will be technically evaluated by NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, other Navy, DoD, and Government organizations, and some academic and industry participants for the purposes of market research and the development of a HEDS Roadmap.
A HEDS Roadmap workshop is scheduled for 12-16 July 2010 at NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane and in Bloomington, IN.  Respondees to this announcement are asked to indicate their interest in participating in the HEDS Roadmap workshop.  Some respondees from academia and industry may be invited to participate as working group members for this workshop.  
The HEDS Roadmap workshop will be highly technical in nature; marketing and sales pitches will not be allowed.  Participants ideally will be chief engineers/scientists or other similar senior personnel with an orientation toward the energy and power sources expected to be achieved in the next 30 years.  

SAMPLE "WHITE PAPER" RESPONSE OUTLINE
Interested parties shall submit via email an initial synopsis. (commonly referred to as a "white paper")   Offerors should submit all correspondence (white papers, bio, comments) electronically to the NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane Contracting Office point of contact below NLT 2  PM EDT 05/10/2010.  Please insert "N00164-10-R-GS67 - HEDS" on all correspondence.
Submit a white paper of one page or less in length that briefly discusses one energy/power technology capability that will be a significant difference maker to the warfighter at any point between the years 2010 and 2040. For example, if you were to bet on a particular capability that could be in production during that timeframe that provided a highly significant return on investment, what would that capability be and why?  Also suggest potential applications that could incorporate this technology capability.  Respondees are encouraged to submit papers both on conventional capabilities as well as advanced and exotic capabilities.
Respondees may submit separate papers on as many such capabilities as they wish.  Such capabilities do not have to be within the current or planned product line of their employer.  Any technology readiness level may be considered that could result in at least small-scale manufacturing of that product by the year 2040.  
Respondees who wish to be considered for an invitation to participate in the workshop must submit a biography via email.  Invitees will be notified of workshop details.  Attendance at the HEDS Roadmap workshop is limited to U.S. citizens employed by the U.S. Government, U.S. academic institutions, and U.S. industry.
Note that the responses to this RFI may be viewed by academic/industry representatives within the working groups.  Therefore, do not submit any proprietary or confidential business sensitive information.
This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP), and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any costs incurred by invited attendees or their employers relating to workshop participation will NOT be reimbursed. Any information submitted to the Government under this RFI will not be returned.

<DESC>PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATINAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Mobile District has a requirement to upgrade the Walter F. George Lock and Dam Spillway Gate Controls.  Walter F. George Lock and Dam are currently expanding the plant Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems to encompass the spillway gates.  The system currently in place is the SCADA system that was supplied by Scipar, Inc.  Due to the uniqueness of the functions performed by the custom applications and their interdependence with the hardware, installation of another system and program changes and additions to the existing SCADA system would limit the functionality of the installed system. Changes made by another vendor would interfere with the operability of the existing SCADA functions, and would negatively affect powerhouse operations.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Scipar Inc, 26 West Spring St, NY 14221, under authority of FAR 6.302.  The contract to install the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems at Walter F George was originally competed and awarded to Scipar Inc., who installed some custom applications and software that are proprietary and licensed for USACE use only.  Therefore, Scipar Inc. is the only source capable of modifying the existing applications and software to expand the system capabilities to remotely control the Walter F. George spillway gates.  It is anticipated that a fixed Price contract will be awarded.  The (NAICS) code is 541519 and size standard is $25.0 Mil.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions should be sent by email to Geanette Kelley, at geanette.kelley@usace.army.mil.  <BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201e.   This is not a solicitation for proposals.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.  No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.<BR><BR>BACKGROUND:<BR><BR>Chemical Biological Medical Systems  Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (CBMS-JVAP) is the DoD organization responsible for developing, producing and stockpiling FDA-licensed vaccine systems to protect the Warfighter from biological agents. The current CBMS-JVAP portfolio includes vaccines at varying stages of clinical development in addition to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines. <BR><BR>RFI number W9113M-10-S-0005 was issued in January for the purpose of collecting information to determine the appropriate contract solution for developing and producing FDA licensed filovirus vaccine(s).  The current planned approach is to use smaller contracts, along with Interagency and International Agreements to perform development efforts through completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  <BR><BR>REQUIREMENT:  CBMS-JVAP has a new requirement for a pre-exposure prophylaxis filovirus vaccine that provides balanced onset and duration of protection for administration to healthy individuals.  The vaccine must provide broad spectrum protection against exposure to multiple species of the Ebola (minimally Sudan and Zaire) and Marburg viruses.  Because there are no naturally occurring incidences of aerosolized filovirus exposure, this vaccine is expected to be developed under the Animal Rule (21 CFR 601 Subpart H). <BR><BR>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:  The primary objective of issuing this RFI is to seek information and comments from companies that own or have the right/ability to license Intellectual Property (IP) for filovirus vaccines. The Government is seeking to purchase or license the IP for a filovirus vaccine and to develop the selected candidate through a Phase 1 clinical trial(s).  Specifically, CBMS-JVAP is seeking filovirus vaccine candidates that have in vivo efficacy data demonstrating protection against Ebola and Marburg viruses and in vivo animal safety/performance data that would suggest safety of the proposed vaccine.  <BR><BR>As such, the Government is researching information and interest about current industry capabilities via responses to the areas listed below:<BR><BR>A.	Describe your companys filovirus vaccine candidate that is currently under development.  Specifically, identify the candidates capabilities to fulfill the CBRN prophylactic requirement specified above, including: a description of their candidate which clearly supports its prophylactic potential; summary of in vivo efficacy (i.e., route of challenge, challenge species, animal model) and safety data; and a description of the manufacturing process, if available. <BR>B.	Describe your companys rights and ability to sell or license the filovirus vaccine IP.  State your companys interest in selling or licensing the IP.  The Government intends to develop the candidate using any means it deems appropriate and may grant sub-licenses or transfer ownership or the license, if applicable, to third parties.  Therefore, the Government seeks Unlimited Rights.  If your companys interest is in licensing rather than selling the IP, and Unlimited Rights are not an option, explain the Restricted Rights that would potentially be offered to the Government.   <BR>C.	Express level of interest in ongoing participation as a consultant for development of the candidate.<BR>D.	Indicate company business size (based on the NAICS size standard), business status (i.e., large business, small business, disadvantaged, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, etc.), and date of incorporation.<BR> <BR>The Government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <BR><BR>Questions regarding this RFI should be forwarded to the CBMS e-mail address listed below within 5 days after RFI release.  <BR><BR>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS:<BR><BR>All written responses must be received within 15 days of issuance of this RFI.  Submissions should: (1) use Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF); (2) be sent to CBMSFiloRFP@AMEDD.ARMY.MIL; (3) be minimum 11 font on 8.5 X 11 paper; (4) be complete, sufficiently detailed, and organized in a manner that tracks to the information requested in this RFI; (5) include a single company point of contact with name, title, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address(es); and (6) not exceed 10 single sided pages in total (not including cover page and cover letter). Other media types (i.e. CD, printed technical information) that meet the submission criteria above will be accepted and should be sent to US Army Space & Missile Defense Command, ATTN: Larry Mize, 64 Thomas Johnson Drive, Frederick, Maryland 21702.

Arundo donax L., giant reed is an exotic and invasive weed of riparian habitats and irrigation canals of the Rio Grande River Basin and the southwestern U.S. Arundo dominates these habitats, which leads to: loss of biodiversity; catastrophic stream bank erosion; damage to bridges; increased costs for chemical and mechanical control along transportation corridors, and impedes law enforcement activities on the international border. Additionally, this invasive weed competes for water resources in an arid region where these resources are critical to the environment, agriculture and municipal users. Biological control using insects from the native range of Arundo may be the best option for long-term management of this weed. Arundo donax is a good target for biological control because it has no close relatives in North or South America, and several of the plant-feeding insects from its native range in Mediterranean Europe are known to be specialists feeding only on this one plant species. USDA-ARS has an on-going biological control program for Arundo.</p>
<p>Additional plant production of Arundo is needed for use in the insect mass-rearing program. 1) Contractor will grow Arundo donax plants in 3 gallon plants. 2) Contractor will provide weekly deliveries (every Monday and Thursday, 500 each day) of 1,000, 3 gallon pots of Arundo donax plants. 3) Contractor will deliver healthy Arundo donax plants that are 18-24 inches tall and have a minimum of 3 stems emerging from the rhizome. 4) Contractor must obtain prior approval from USDA, ARS to apply any insecticides to plants. (NO insecticide use without prior approval.) 5) Arundo donax plants must be grown from Arundo donax rhizomes (4-8 inches long) that are mechanically field harvested by the Contractor from the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The main bud must be cut from the rhizome to stimulate multiple buds. 6) Plants may need to be grown in native Lower Rio Grande Valley sandy loam soil or soil mix as specified by USDA. Soil PH may need to be adjusted to 7.1. 7) Plants must be grown in an enclosed and heated greenhouse that will not have any insecticide use on other crops. Greenhouses must be capable of maintaining a minimum average temperature of 80 degrees F during winter. 8) Plants need to be fertilized with urea fertilizer as required by USDA. 9) Plants must be grown from rhizomes that are no older than 1 week from field harvest. 10) USDA reserves the right to cancel the contract with a 30 day written notice from the Contracting Officer. 11) USDA reserves the right to decrease or increase the number of plants delivered each week with advance notice to the grower. Advance notice will account for the time it takes for the grower to dig and grow the optimum plant. 12) Period of the performance is 26 weeks.</p>

<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE</strong>: Armament Technology</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE</strong>: Initial Announcement</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER</strong>: BAA-RWK-10-0001</p>
<p><strong>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S):</strong> 12.800 Air Force Defense Research Sciences Program</p>
<p><strong>WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME</strong>: This BAA will remain open through 30 April 2011, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. <strong>White papers</strong> may be submitted at any time during the open period to <strong>afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW) under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed at increasing knowledge and understanding in relation to long term national security needs. It is an enhancement to related exploratory and advanced development programs. A program should be designed to demonstrate well-defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort. Any significant testing is unlikely; however, there is a possibility of experimental testing to support battle lab experiments proposed under this BAA. Occasionally, AFRL/RW will have more specific research interests or topics that warrant specific attention. Under those circumstances, a specific BAA will be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding availability, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria. Programs to support Team Eglin Technology Demonstration Programs may also be considered under this BAA.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for research in armament technology. This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to this Directorate. Offerors contemplating submission of a proposal to AFRL/RW should carefully examine this BAA, and are also strongly encouraged to contact the appropriate AFRL/RW technical Point of Contact (POC) identified in this publication to ascertain the extent of interest AFRL/RW may have in a specific research project.</p>
<p>AFRL/RW is the primary Air Force organization concerned with conventional munitions technology development. AFRL/RW plans and executes research, development, and test of conventional munitions, and supports conventional munitions Wings/Groups or Weapons Program Offices. There are four divisions within the Munitions Directorate that conduct research and development (R&amp;D). They are the Demonstration Division, the Advanced Guidance Division, the Strategic Planning and Assessment Division, and the Ordnance Division.</p>
<p><strong>DEMONSTRATION DIVISION (RWA)</strong><br />The Demonstration Division (RWA) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile airframes, and submunition design and dispensing. RWA also integrates optimal subsystems, performs tests, and conducts flight demonstrations. RWA consists of the Systems of Systems Branch (RWAS), and the Flight Vehicles Integration Branch (RWAV).</p>
<p><strong>ADVANCED GUIDANCE DIVISION (RWG)</strong><br />The Advanced Guidance Division (RWG) conducts research and directs exploratory and advanced development in guidance and control technology to support development of autonomous, precision-guided munitions. The relevant technologies are in two general areas: seekers and conventional guidance and control. The seeker technologies include electro-optical, infrared, millimeter-wave, and radio frequency seekers for air-to-air and air-to-surface conventional weapons, exointerceptors, and submunition guidance. This includes signal/image processing algorithms and processors. Conventional guidance and control includes inertial sensors, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, antijam GPS technologies, and relevant information processing including guidance laws, state vector estimators, and autopilots. RWG performs digital modeling and simulation, synthetic scene generation, laboratory, field, and captive flight tests of seeker concepts and conventional guidance and control concepts. RWG also operates and maintains a hardware-in-the-loop closed loop guidance evaluation facility with synthetic scene generation and digital modeling and simulation capability, a radio-frequency measurement laboratory, a laser radar facility, an advanced navigation laboratory, and an electro-optics laboratory. RWG consists of the Integration Guidance Simulation Branch (RWGG), Integration Sensing &amp; Processing Sciences Branch (RWGI), Weapons Dynamics &amp; Controls Branch (RWGN), and the Weapons Seeker Sciences Branch (RWGS.)</p>
<p><strong>ORDNANCE DIVISION (RWM)</strong><br />The Ordnance Division (RWM) directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development research of fuzes, damage mechanisms, and energetic materials for air launched munitions for use with a full array of launch platforms including fighter, bomber, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft. RWM consists of the Energetic Materials Branch (RWME), Fuzes Branch (RWMF), Damage Mechanisms Branch (RWMW), and Ordnance Integration Branch (RWMI). RWME operates the High Explosives R&amp;D (HERD) facility which is responsible for the development of energetic materials from concept formulation through pilot plant production for transition into existing or future inventory weapon systems. RWMF is responsible for the research and development of technologies to enable precision burst point control initiation of current and future weapon systems. Examples of precision burst point control include post-impact hard target intelligent fuzing and high-closing rate air-to-air and air-to-ground target imaging and aim point selection. RWMW interests range from fundamental understanding of detonation wave implications for damage mechanism formation (i.e., explosively formed penetrators, stretch long rod penetrators, directed fragments) to shaped charge liner materials processing in the Focused Energy Warheads arena that is striving to reduce warhead size and increase lethality and adaptability for application to surface mobile targets and fixed targets. These interests range from fundamental understanding of material behavior in high rate, high-pressure processes (i.e., strain, erosion, toughness), to enhancement of existing blast/fragment warheads, to R&amp;D of novel kill mechanisms for fixed surface targets, both soft and hardened, in the Unitary Warheads arena. RWMI is responsible for conducting the ordnance level studies to establish the development trade space for the fuze, energetic materials and damage mechanism technologies. RWMI is also responsible for defining the interfaces between these technologies, and integrating and demonstrating various levels of ordnance packages prior to higher level weapon system integration and/or transition.</p>
<p><strong>STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ASSESSMENT DIVISION (RWP)</strong><br />The Strategic Planning and Assessment Division (RWP) is responsible for strategic planning and assessment of lethality, effectiveness, utility of weapon technologies, and evaluation of expected weapon performance by simulation. Strategic planning consists of overall RW investment planning; determining warfighter issues and requirements related to munitions and the transition opportunities for science and technology, and managing the cooperative research, technology transfer, and SBIR programs. RWP directs and conducts research and exploratory and advanced development in weapon/missile modeling and simulation, basic physics and computational modeling. RWP consists of the Capability Planning Branch (RWPB), the Computational Mechanics Branch (RWPC), and the Lethality and Vulnerability Branch (RWPL).</p>
<p>The descriptions of the technical areas are organized by scientific discipline, and the reader may note some overlap between sections. The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the sixteen prospective research areas. These descriptions are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to challenge the reader to create and submit truly creative proposals that have the potential to dramatically shift existing air delivered munitions paradigms. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Directorate focal points associated with these technology areas. However, any submitted white paper or proposal must be grounded in achievable technology goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FLIGHT VEHICLES INTEGRATION RESEARCH (RWAV)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform flight vehicles integration research in the areas of: weapon airframe design, weapon propulsion integration, alternate flight control, miniature weapon design and dispensing technology, precision emplacement, compact power systems for micro air vehicles (MAVs), energy harvesting systems for MAVs, and compressed carriage munition design. Applications include high angle-of-attack missile, air-to-air and air-to-surface weapon airframes, rapid response weapon concepts for use on time-critical targets, hypersonic platform and space operating vehicle weapon integration/dispensing, unmanned combat air vehicle weapon integration/dispensing and micro air vehicle munitions. Other areas of interest include active and passive control of air vehicles through the use of innovative technologies such as adaptive smart structures, micro-electromechanical systems (e.g. micro blowing, synthetic jets), application of weakly ionized gasdynamics (i.e. plasma aerodynamics), and innovative methods for munitions strike performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Technical POC: <br />Dr. Azar Ali<br />AFRL/RWA<br />(850) 882-8876<br />Fax: (850) 882-4793<br />azar.ali@eglin.af.mil</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 2 - BIOMIMETIC SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL (RWGI)</strong></p>
<p>Both biological systems and smart munitions are required to collect space, time, and color information from the environment, process it, and make some decision. The decision may be that of detecting, recognizing, tracking, or intercepting an object. The decision may also be that of changing position or direction of motion for vehicle navigation or for better viewing of a target. A clear understanding of how the natural systems collect and process information to make these kinds of decisions may lead to revolutionary seeker concepts for autonomous weapons, as well as other machine vision applications. Thus, RWGI is interested in signal processing and control methods that use natural concepts found in biological systems. Our focus in biomimetics (the science of mimicking biological systems) is on leveraging efforts previously aimed at understanding how life forms collect and process environmental information. We want to use what is understood about the natural seekers to build small and affordable autonomous munitions seekers. As biologically inspired seeker system concepts mature and exploit commercially available technology, the resemblance to the original biological system may diminish or even disappear. This consequence reflects our focus on building affordable, capable seekers for smart munitions. Proposed concepts should support the mission of the Munitions Directorate and Advanced Guidance Division.</p>

<p>RWGI is interested in investigating all aspects of Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) technology as it applies to seekers for conventional guided weapons. Interests range from basic signal/image processing foundations through tower and flight test of advanced real time ATR/host signal processor implementations. ATR systems (and related technologies) designed for use with all relevant weapon system sensors (MMW Radar, SAR, IIR, LADAR, Dual Mode combinations, etc.) are of interest.</p>

<p>RWGG is interested in developing advanced capabilities related to hardware-in-the-loop and digital simulation of guided weapon designs. RWGG exercises simulations to verify weapon performance, with particular emphasis on target acquisition, tracking, and guidance performance during terminal homing. Sensors and algorithms for Strategic and Theater Missile Defense concepts developed under the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Tactical Munitions subsystems developed within AFRL/RW are evaluated. Weapons tested typically include visible, imaging infrared, millimeter-wave, and/or LADAR seeker subsystems. Emphasis for simulation technology research is placed on advancement of scene projection technologies, real-time target scene generation techniques, target phenomenology methods, simulation architectures, compact range millimeter-wave simulators, wide field-of-view flight motion simulators, and high bandwidth motion simulators.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 5 - ADVANCED SCENE GENERATION (RWGG)</strong></p>
<p>Integral to the development of advanced munitions programs is the capability at AFRL/RW to perform high fidelity simulation-based testing of munitions, components and systems. The current capability to generate synthetic imagery for high fidelity hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) and Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) algorithm testing is based on a toolbox of independent Government and industry tools for predicting threat characteristics, environmental effects, and munitions hardware and software performance. The evolution in complexity and capability of modern weapons systems, however, is leading to demands for higher fidelity and performance from test simulations. In addition, the integrated nature of the modern battlefield requires test simulations to encompass not only the weapon itself, but also a variety of other systems. New scene generation (SG) techniques are needed in the areas of characterization of Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and Air Force threats, urban environments, chemical/biological effects, coupling and integration of scene generation software, multiple sensor views, and advanced computing techniques. These SG improvements must be designed to streamline the process for evaluating guided munitions concepts from initial design to final implementation, lowering development costs and shortening time from drawing board to battlefield. The improved testing realism will provide confidence that the munitions will perform as expected under a much wider variety of combat conditions than previously possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 6 - LASER RADAR COMPONENT RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing the components and systems necessary for imaging and non-imaging laser radar systems. These include, but are not limited to, optical sources, detector systems, beam pointing and beam scanning systems, detection schemes, and discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems. Interests range from complete systems and devices to basic materials and components. These include the following: Optical Sources: Optical sources of various wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared (&lt; 5 microns) are desired. These devices may be diodes, diode or flashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, or optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). The systems can operate at moderate output powers at pulse repetition rates ranging from a few Hz to greater than 1 MHz. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, novel laser and OPO operating schemes, laser and OPO systems and designs, optical coatings, laser materials, and non-linear materials. Associated technologies, such as diode drive electronics, output power control and stabilization, wavelength tuning and stabilization techniques, rapid pulse generation, optical shutters and Q switches, polarization and phase controllers, and optical coupling techniques are also of interest. Detector systems: Single element and array detectors sensitive in the visible to mid-infrared wavelength range are desired. Rapid rise times (approaching a nanosecond) are desired, as is operability without cryogenic cooling. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, detector systems, detector materials, amplification and biasing electronics, temperature control systems, wavelength selection (filters, gratings, etc.), and readout technologies (for array detectors). Beam pointing and beam scanning systems: Systems that can rapidly steer a laser beam as well as the field of view of the detector are desired. Systems capable of search/track modes and variable fields of view are also desired. Technologies of interest include, but are not limited to, controlled mirror sets, microlens assemblies, gratings, acousto-optical devices, and liquid crystal devices. Associated technologies such as scanning drives and controllers, beam direction monitoring techniques, and pointing stabilization techniques are also of interest. Detection schemes: Various incoherent and coherent detection schemes are of interest. Such schemes include, but are not limited to, direct detection of reflected radiation, return detection of a modulated signal, detection of laser-induced fluorescence, and detection of raman scattered radiation. Possible methods for coherent detection include amplitude, frequency, phase, or polarization modulation. Discrimination, ranging, and acquisition systems: Systems that can discriminate the signal from the background environment, condition the signal, and store the data are required. These systems should be able to resolve time differences as small as or smaller than a nanosecond, dynamically adjust the gain of any amplification stages, allow variable timing/ranging techniques, and/or minimize range uncertainty. A variety of discrimination techniques are of interest, including nth pulse detection, constant fraction threshold detection, variable threshold detection, and others.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 7 - NAVIGATION AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (RWGN)</strong></p>
<p>RWGN is developing global positioning system (GPS) anti-jam technology, geo-referenced alternative to GPS navigation, control algorithms for agile autonomous micro air vehicles and micro munitions, vision-based guidance methodologies, control algorithms for path planning and task assignment of cooperative systems of munitions and air vehicles, track fusion and on-line state estimation methods for fusing target tracks between weapon platforms, methodologies for operators to supervise the time critical control of collections of cooperating air vehicles, small and low cost components for secure low probability of intercept data links on micro weapons, and network topologies and routing algorithms for small to large networks of munitions with line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links. GPS technologies of interest are anti-jam techniques including spatial (beam forming and/or null steering) and temporal anti-jam technologies, and miniature GPS antenna technologies. Biologically inspired but mathematically rigorous techniques are being pursued for agile and vision-based guidance and control. Cooperative control methodologies currently emphasize integrated path planning and task assignment, hedging for un-modeled (adversarial induced) uncertainty, and information theoretic bounds on performance of cooperative networks. Data link technologies are needed that will yield extreme miniaturization while being compatible with current and future military tactical networks.</p>

<p>The goal of this work is to develop/modify and employ models used to analyze advanced weapon concepts and their related concepts of employment to highlight technologies worthy of consideration for investment. The objective is to apply, modify and/or combine engineering, engagement (one-on-one), mission (few-on-few), systems-of-systems, campaign (many-on-many, military worth), level modeling techniques, tools, and analysis methods as well as virtual and constructive digital simulation which lend themselves to the quick and effective evaluation of advanced weapon concepts. Concepts include, but are not limited to, intercommunicative weapons, novel damage mechanisms, lethal and non-lethal destruct mechanisms, multiple targeting, and time critical delivery. Detailed modeling includes, but is not limited to, sensors, aerodynamics, autopilots, navigation and guidance schemes, propulsion, warheads, fuzes, datalinks, error filters, environment (wind, fog, dust), lethality, vulnerability, and threats. Scenario development and visualization at each level of MS&amp;A is also sought. Research into new simulation toolsets and architectures designed for this purpose will also be considered. Additionally, environmental factors that influence a weapons performance can be considered. This can include but not be limited to urban environments, collaborative simulation environments, scenario generation and infrastructure simulation common to environments that weapons may operate in. Existing tools of interest include, but are not limited to, ESAMS, RADGUNS, MATLAB/Simulink, FLAMES, EADSIM, CFAM, and STORM. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be performed on-site (e.g. at the Government facility) and security clearances at the SECRET level will be required.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TARGET VULNERABILITY AND WEAPON EFFECTIVENESS (RWPL)</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to collect data, conduct research, develop/modify and employ responsive modeling tools, target models, and processes as part of AFRL's R&amp;D efforts. These efforts will identify potential vulnerabilities in targets and their subcomponents for conventional or concept weapons to exploit. They will also enable understanding and predictive capability for the effectiveness of inventory, developmental, and conceptual munitions when deployed against targets and critical components. Targets of interest can include but are not limited to mobile, fixed (above and below ground), hard and deeply buried, chem-bio and air-to-air. This research will allow development of new techniques or enhancement of existing techniques to measure and compare weapon effectiveness, collateral damage, and potential collateral hazards. Research will include improvements in our ability to predict and measure component vulnerability and functional defeat allowing assessment of weapon effects that degrade a target's ability to perform its intended functions without necessarily destroying it. It could also include research and modeling of new or conceptual damage mechanisms. Development of new target and associated functional models would improve our abilities to exploit high interest targets or newly discovered vulnerabilities. Research to enhance or develop methodology to account for the target critical equipment/components, and their interconnections, and associated failure logic and failure modes could be required. Tools of interest include, but are not limited to AJEM, ARM, BLASTX, BRL-CAD, Endgame Framework, FastCD, FASTGEN, FATEPEN, IMEA, JWS, MEVA, ORCA, PENCURV, PDAM, STEP, STMG, VALUE, WEAPS, and WinBLAST. White papers and proposals should be designed to demonstrate substantive knowledge in any or all of the specific areas of weapon testing, experimentation and weapon effectiveness and target vulnerability MS&amp;A. Some or all of the work performed under this BAA Research Area will be classified. Approved classified processing capabilities and security clearances at the SECRET level as a minimum will be required.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - WEAPON/TARGET MECHANICS (RWPC)</strong></p>
<p>The performance assessment and development of advanced conventional weapon systems requires the capabilities to model complex weapon/target interaction phenomena and to predict environments produced by impacting, penetrating, and detonating warheads. Modeling may be achieved with simplified engineering models or system/subsystem analysis codes, but the emphasis of this effort is the development and validation of continuum mechanics codes yielding high fidelity weapon and target models. Areas of particular interest include penetration mechanics, high strain rate fracture dynamics and constitutive modeling, modeling the shock survivability of fuze<br />electronic components, predictive models for the change in material properties due to thermal cycling (energetics and electronics), fragmentation, mesoscale modeling (metals and energetics), localized shear band formation, high pressure/high strain rate modeling of geologic and geologically derived materials, modeling of reacting droplet and particulate flows, equation of state and constitutive models for chemical and biological agents, numerical modeling of neutralization mechanisms for biological and<br />chemical agents, hydrodynamic ram, atomization and aerosolization of chemical and biological agents, direct numerical simulation of detonations, coupled detonation physics and multi-phase flow, accurate and efficient boundary interface treatments, the ability to span several orders of magnitude in spatial and temporal length scales, and advanced numerical methods.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 11 - DAMAGE MECHANISMS RESEARCH (RWMW)</strong></p>
<p>RWMW is interested in all aspects conventional munitions warhead technology as it relates to the destruction, damage, defeat, or denial of function. Technologies and concepts are sought for a robust and affordable capability of air-launched munitions in the areas of: hard and deeply buried targets, fixed ground targets, mobile ground vehicles, air dominance, chemical/biological/radiological/nuclear/explosive (CBRNE) neutralization or access denial, and cybernet neutralization. Additionally, there is interest in specialized diagnostics, techniques, and experimental methods for the development and validation of these capabilities. Technical interests within the Hard Target Effects technical competency are in penetration mechanics, materials for surviving high speed penetration of geologic and cementitious materials, abrasion resistance, terradynamic stability, innovative case structures and composites, and production methods. Fundamental science studies in high rate particulate flow and meso-scale modeling is an area of emphasis. The Damage Effects technical competency has interests in miniature and micro warheads, multifunctional energetic materials and damage mechanisms, directional control and focused effects, selectable effects, and collateral damage control. Approaches in all of these areas are not to be limited to traditional nor classical blast-fragmentation effects. Novel concepts of target defeat are encouraged to augment or replace the more traditional kinetic energy methods.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 12 - FUZE RESEARCH (RWMF)<br /></strong><br />RWMF develops, demonstrates, and transitions technologies that have application to fuzes for air-delivered weapons, including, but not limited to, guided and unguided bombs, missiles, and submunitions. Fuzes must reliably remain in a safe mode until the appropriate post-deployment environments (such as freefall) are sensed; the fuze must then arm the weapon and, upon receiving a signal from a target detection device (TDD), initiate the explosive fill (or other damage mechanism). RWMF thus seeks proposals for innovative technologies that can be integrated into the design or testing of air-delivered weapon fuzes.<br />RWMF is particularly interested in fuzes (including submunition fuzes) and related technologies that are capable of surviving the repetitive, multi-axis shock environment experienced by a fuze during penetration of a hardened target and functioning the warhead through cockpit-selectable time delay functions and advanced post-impact environmental sensing. However, current test technologies do not fully duplicate the multi-axial fuze environment in terms of duration, repetitive high-acceleration loading, and other aspects of the mechanical loading profile. This necessitates extremely expensive sled tests for fuze research, testing, qualification, and performance evaluation. Therefore, a need exists for laboratory and field test techniques and equipment to duplicate these repetitive, multi-axial shocks.<br />Some additional penetration fuzing-specific research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Develop a jam-resistant, greater than 250 kilobits/second shock-hardened wireless Data Link for two-way communication with a fuze during a weapon's deep underground penetration event;<br />- Investigate methods/techniques for improving the shock survivability of inventory hardened fuzes (FMU-143, FMU-152) used in penetrating weapons; e.g., techniques for eliminating gaps/air voids between the fuze and fuzewell;<br />- Develop a hardened, passive, unpowered, tri-axial device that irreversibly and measurably changes some physical configuration or property without relaxation/hysteresis to record the peak acceleration as a back-up data point for tests when a hardened fuze data recorder fails;<br />- Develop a low-cost (&lt;$100), shock-hardened accelerometer;<br />- Develop non-inertial techniques and appropriate devices for detecting voids and layers during hard target penetration; and<br />- Develop a miniature passive or active sensor capable of identifying case breakup and/or severe trajectory instability during a hardened penetration event for the purpose of salvaging the fuze function and high explosive detonation-this technology must operate inside an existing fuze well as an add-on to existing fuze components and have low false alarm rate.<br />RWMF is also interested in improved sensors, techniques, and/or systems for second safety environment sensing for gravity released general-purpose bombs. For example, an improvement or replacement for the FZU-32, -48, etc., would be of significant interest. <br />In the area of miniature and micro-munition fuzing, research tasks of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br />- Reliable miniature three port air valve that has a wide temperature operating range (-55 to +75 degree C) <br />- Ground profiling fuze sensor technology<br />- Active imaging aimpoint selecting fuze sensor technology<br />The final area of focused interest is in the area of in-line and out-of-line initiation systems. RWMF Initiation Science and Technology group is interested in novel ignition devices or ignition circuitry that can enhance reliability while reducing energy budgets for initiation systems. Additionally, concepts that would enable novel warhead designs are of interest. We are also interested in novel or more inherently robust manufacturing processes that can be applied to components within initiation systems. Finally, there is interest in methods or techniques for characterizing performance of those systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 13 - ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>Advanced energetics research proposals are of particular interest. This topic includes development of more energetic materials and/or combinations of materials including nanometric explosives as well as other high energy density materials. Reactive materials comprising metastable interstitial composites (MICs) and/or metal fuels in combination with oxidizers and explosives are also included. Constitutive modeling of these materials, including mesoscale descriptions of their dynamic mechanical response, initiation mechanisms and reactive equations of state are included as well. Novel approaches for formulating, processing, enhancing the mechanical properties (i.e., strength, toughness) and characterizing the special features of novel energetic materials and functionally graded materials in terms of their performance and energy release benefits are also of interest.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 14 - FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT ENABLING MICRO MUNITIONS AND ADVANCED ENERGETICS (RWME)</strong></p>
<p>AFRL/RW anticipates a need for new, improved, and often unique facilities and equipment to support expanding future in-house RDT&amp;E (research, development, test, and evaluation) work especially in the areas of micro munitions and advanced energetic. This work will require facilities with the capability to work with energetic nano materials that may also be classified as an explosive. These new RW facilities and equipment will enable world class research, development, integration, fabrication and testing of future prototype munitions system concepts demonstrating emerging micro munition and advanced energetics technologies. Developing concepts and preliminary designs for these new and unique facilities as well as for much of the new equipment to be used in these facilities will need to be approached as research and development projects, not as just design projects. New control/monitoring techniques and equipment will be required to simultaneously meet HVAC requirements for working with nano materials that are also an explosive especially in areas where a clean room environment is required. Of particular interest are proposals for preliminary feasibility studies; concept development, assessment, evaluation, preliminary design and associated cost estimates/presentation material for the new facilities and/or new research equipment that will be required to pursue this evolution of energetics from conventional explosives to reactive materials and nano energetics and munitions from the current conventional munitions to micro munitions. Also of interest are proposals for structural response calculations/modeling, design analysis, and design needed to support Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) submittals/presentations required for explosives siting approval of new facilities to be located at one of RW's remote explosives locations. This topic includes work to advance the understanding of nano energetic material effects on both the human body and the environment as well as work relating to the understanding, interpretation, and assessment of present and likely future applicable environmental, safety, and health requirements/regulations that would relate to nano energetics. A need is anticipated for developing new systems/components that will enable the new facilities and equipment to meet these emerging future requirements/regulations.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 15 - Multi-function Multi-mode RADAR RESEARCH (RWGS)</strong></p>
<p>RWG has an interest in developing innovative multifunction radar systems that lend themselves to a variety of applications for both munitions and Combat UAV's. There is a need for generating multi mode seeker systems where RF is one of the modes that can provide the weather capability and be amalgamated innovatively with IR, EO or Ladar modes in order to provide improved ATR and aim point selection to the munitions seeker system. There is also the interest of creating small munitions seeker and sensor technologies that would provide low cost solutions for creating submunitions seekers. These seekers are to be integrated into a 20 pound munitions full-up-round, for creating smart guided submunitions that can be incorporated into a larger cluster munition for dispensing in a target rich environment. These submunitions require weather capability, and innovative miniature RF solutions are of great interest. There is also interest in developing a Noise/ LPI radar seeker that can provide the capability of not being detected. These seekers must provide the function of detecting, acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets with a very small probability of being detected. The interest also extends to hypersonic and high speed environments. The high speed environment provides interesting requirements that provide great opportunities for innovations in materials implementation, apertures, component technologies and processing. RWG is also interested in dome technology and dome materials for these high speed applications. Concepts and innovative ideas for solutions to these different seeker applications are also of interest. The various seeker applications listed above have many implications of RF components, aperture technology ( conformal, broadband, electronically steered, mechanically steered, concentric apertures), real time processing, miniaturization of subsystems, etc. Signal processing techniques for these various seeker technology described, and the ability to detect, track, and engage targets is of interest. The seeker systems listed above are also expected to provide good measurements for the purpose of guiding the munitions, or CUAC to the intended target. Along with this is the ability to provide measurements or information for the use of classifying the target once reacquired. Another interest is in the seeker system being able to provide fuzing information that would lend itself for an innovative approach for Guidance integrated Fuzing (GIF) applications.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 16 - REVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH (RW)</strong></p>
<p>This research area is intended to cover, in general nature, all revolutionary research areas of interest to this Directorate. AFRL/RW is interested in revolutionary munitions-related research that has the potential to create new<br />airframe, ordnance, and guidance and control technology weapon paradigms. One of the goals of this program is to develop highly innovative solutions relating to munitions ordnance packages and airframe technology for the purpose of defeating a variety of targets including fixed and moving targets, hard and soft targets, and above ground and deeply buried targets. Ideas and concepts are sought that represent new approaches - lethal and non-lethal - to defeat these targets. With this type of revolutionary thinking, as opposed to evolutionary, order of magnitude increases in performance may be realized.</p>
<p>The military payoff would be in terms of significant munitions weight and size<br />reduction, reduced weapon cost, and improved effectiveness. Non-lethal<br />approaches also have the benefit of disabling enemy capabilities with reduced<br />loss of life.</p>
<p>Another goal of this research area is to develop highly innovative concepts and approaches in guidance and control technologies for air-deliverable autonomous munitions. This program may develop advanced concepts in such areas as electro-optical, infrared, millimeter wave, and radio frequency seeker technology with the components and signal/image processing systems used in such seekers. Advanced concepts in the guidance, navigation and control (GN&amp;C) of munitions airframes will also be sought. The basic seeker technologies to be considered include: sensing materials, sensing elements for target characterization, autonomous target acquisition algorithms, signal and image processing algorithms, and multi-sensor data fusion algorithms. The basic GN&amp;C technologies include: miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, jam resistant GPS, and micro-electro-mechanical system based sensing and control cooperative attack algorithms. In addition to advancements in the basic technology, revolutionary changes that shift current or create new guidance and control paradigms will be developed.</p>

<p><strong>V. WHITE PAPER REVIEW INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Criteria:</strong> The following four criteria and an assessment of risk will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria and proposal risk for schedule discussed in paragraph 2 below will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested.</p>
<p>The following factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:<br /></strong><br />a. An integrated assessment of the proposed technical approach to include scientific and/or technical merits and the potential contributions of the effort to extending the scientific understanding associated with the technologies being pursued by the four AFRL/RW Divisions and described in the 16 research areas. <br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed project objectives presented in the white paper/formal proposal. <br />d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding). Cost/Price is a substantial factor but is ranked as the fourth order of priority.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical and cost will be assessed for white papers and formal proposals, should they be requested, as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential scientific benefit. Additionally for formal proposals, proposal risk for schedule will be evaluated. This relates to an assessment of the risks associated with the offeror's proposed number of hours, labor categories, materials, or other cost elements as it relates to meeting the proposed period of performance.</p>
<p>Individual white papers will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers as privileged information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. White papers will be subject to an evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should white papers be selected and full proposals requested, the proposal is subject to incorporation into a resulting contract and is therefore releaseable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) unless specifically exempt or portions of the proposal are exempt under FOIA .</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three categories below:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Category I:</span></strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the AFRL/RW technology research areas, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Category II</strong></span>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Category III:</span></strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>

<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE:</strong> Tactical Capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE:</strong> Initial Announcement</p>
<p><strong>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER:</strong> BAA-RWK-10-0003</p>
<p><strong>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) NUMBER(S):</strong> 12.800 AIR FORCE DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES PROGRAM</p>
<p><strong>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> This BAA will remain open through 30 April 2011, or until amended or superseded. It may be reissued and/or amended periodically, as needed. White papers may be submitted at any time during the open period. Submit white papers to afrl.rwk.baaworkflow@eglin.af.mil in accordance with the instructions in paragraph IV below.</p>
<p><strong>1. BACKGROUND - BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN</strong></p>
<p>Certain ground combat capabilities are an Airman's responsibility and require unique surface operations that are integral to the application of air and space power. To meet this responsibility, the Air Force recognized the need to organize, train, and equip a force of Battlefield Airmen (BA) capable of delivering distinctive expertise in a ground combat environment with unequaled firepower, accuracy, responsiveness, flexibility and persistence. These BA include Combat Control, Pararescue, Tactical Air Control and Battlefield Weather professionals. BA provide skill sets not commonly found across the Air Force and typically operate in combat zones outside the perimeter of Air Force bases, often in the deep battle space.</p>
<p>Each of these career fields has unique missions in support of both Special Operations Forces and conventional forces. However, many core disciplines are common to the majority of BA. These commonalities include areas such as methods of employment, mobility, force protection methods, communication, and advances in mission planning and rehearsal. Advancements are sought to support specific mission areas as they pertain to each individual career field. To better understand the needs of each BA expertise, a short summary of each career field's mission is provided below.<br />The Air Force Combat Controllers are Special Tactics ground operators who work as members of Air Force Special Tactics Teams and as members of Army Special Forces, Navy SEAL, and Joint Special Operations teams. Combat Controllers are certified to act as air traffic controllers and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers in hostile and dangerous environments. They can be deployed by sea, air, and land to take over or construct an airstrip, set up navigational equipment, and direct airplanes and helicopters to a safe landing without the use of a tower or elaborate communications system. They also establish drop zones and control parachute drops of personnel and equipment, and control airstrikes and air attacks from fixed and rotary-wing aircraft from all military services.</p>
<p>Pararescue Airmen, known as PJs, conduct conventional or unconventional rescue operations. These PJs are the ideal force for personnel recovery and combat search and rescue. PJs' primarily function as personnel recovery specialists with emergency medical capabilities in humanitarian and combat environments. They deploy in any available manner, to include air-land-sea tactics, into restricted environments to authenticate, extract, treat, stabilize and evacuate injured personnel, while acting in an enemy-evading recovery role. PJs participate in search and rescue, combat search and rescue, recovery support for NASA and conduct other operations as appropriate. They are among the most highly trained emergency trauma specialists in the U.S. military, maintaining emergency medical technician-paramedic qualification throughout their careers. With this medical and rescue expertise, along with their deployment capabilities, PJs are able to perform life-saving missions in the world's most remote areas. <br /><br />Battlefield and Special Operations Weathermen are meteorologists with advanced tactical training to operate in hostile or denied territory. They gather and interpret weather data, and provide intelligence from deployed locations while working primarily with Army (Battlefield Weather) and Special Operations (Special Operations Weather) forces. They collect localized weather information, assist mission planning, and generate accurate, mission-tailored target and route forecasts in support of conventional and special operations. They deploy into restricted environments by air, land or sea to observe and analyze weather data. They also train joint force members to take and communicate limited weather observations. Additionally, Special Operations Weathermen conduct special reconnaissance, collect upper air data, organize, establish and maintain weather data reporting networks, determine host nation meteorological capabilities and train foreign national forces. <br /><br />Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) personnel advise U.S. Army conventional and special operations ground maneuver commanders on the integration and execution of air and space power. Qualified individuals, serving as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers, provide final attack control to aircrew when aircraft are inbound to the target, ensuring the aircrew identifies and attacks the correct target, minimizing the risk to friendly ground forces and preventing unwanted collateral damage. Operating on the forward edge of the battle area and behind enemy lines, TACPs coordinate with Theater Air Ground System elements through the use of state-of-the-art communications, and maintain proficiency in the tactics, techniques and procedures of their aligned Army units. When deployed, the TACPs live under austere field conditions, and coordinate, de-conflict, and execute air-to-ground missions within the Army's area of operation.</p>
<p>To continue to maintain superiority over our enemies, research and development to improve the effectiveness of Battlefield Airmen is vital. The Air Force Research Laboratory seeks to address capability gaps, limitations or deficiencies through this Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p><strong>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>This is a Broad Agency Announcement of the Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/RW), under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraph 6.102(d)(2), which provides for competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA, that are selected for award, are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>Tactical Capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces white papers may also be submitted for the acquisition of test assets. In the event these submissions are selected for award, they could be awarded under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2373, Acquisition for Experimental Test Purposes.</p>
<p>For purposes of this announcement, AFRL/RW intends to contract with private industry, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions for research in tactical capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces (BA and SF). Research includes scientific study and experimentation directed at developing technologies, components, and quick reaction capabilities (QRC). This work includes tactical level Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), threat intercept, and force application capabilities for Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces. Potential areas of interest include tactical level targeting applications such as wireless network applications, line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight communication links, remote sensing, remote switching, target tagging, tactical command and control of ground forces, tactical electrical energy, small Unmanned Aerial Systems, and general improvements in situational awareness, targeting, force protection/fractricide prevention, and damage assessment Efforts proposed under this BAA should be designed to demonstrate well defined and substantive research results, should not be overly ambitious or open-ended, and should not be a paper study that inherently requires a substantial testing effort; however, there is the possibility of analysis efforts to support experimental testing or to support other demonstrations proposed under this BAA.</p>
<p>These basic and applied research effort results could include deliverables with provisions for future prototyping, field demonstrations and warfighter evaluation. Prototypes may be a deliverable but only as may be necessary to evaluate the basic or applied research efforts in a meaningful manner. Under some circumstances, we expect that narrowly focused white papers or proposals for advanced research may be required during the time of this open announcement. Under those circumstances, a specific or special BAA amendment may be issued describing the requirement in greater detail, defining funding available, elaborating on white paper or proposal submission due date and format, and possibly providing more specific evaluation criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS</strong></p>
<p>The following narratives are intended to provide an abbreviated description of the prospective research areas mentioned in the Program Description. These descriptions furnish specific examples of areas of interest and Technical Directorate focal points associated with these nine technology focus areas. Proposed efforts under this BAA must be in the realm of basic or applied research. Hardware development that is unrelated to a specific weapon system and not intended directly for the Air Force inventory may qualify if it falls into a category often called "breadboards/brassboards" or exploratory development models. <strong>Development of prototype hardware may be pursued under a BAA; however, such development must be for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of a technology or solution. It should not be for the purpose of acquiring specific hardware that has already been defined or developed by the Government</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 1 - FORCE PROTECTION ENHANCEMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of force protection to enhance the safety, survivability and capabilities of the deployed battlefield airman. The objective is to conduct research which could eventually lead to the development of improved shelters, materials, armor and related items for the deployed Battlefield Airmen. Research to effectively detect, deceive, avoid and prevent contamination and/or injury or exposure to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) and other threats will greatly enhance BA effectiveness. Research in areas that will allow the Battlefield Airmen to engage threats from greater standoff distances is also desired. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0069, 0070, 0071, 0119, 0153, 0272, 0393, 399 and 0409.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for components and software in the areas of command and control, communications, computers, and intelligence in the mission planning, execution, and assessment stages of operation. The objective is to conduct research to improve training, planning, and rehearsal systems that function in a collaborative manner while fostering dramatic improvements in geospatial information systems, database access and information management. Research in fusing multiple sources of information including information in foreign languages, and adroitly cataloguing and classifying data across multiple levels of security classification may be proposed. Technical approaches to improve line of sight and over the horizon bandwidth for voice, video, data burst transmit and receive while maintaining low probabilities of intercept, detection, and exploitation may be proposed. Specific goals are to allow the operator to reduce carried weight and volume while adding long endurance, multi-net, multi-channel communications devices capable of operating in the full range of mission environments. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0001, 0006, 0042, 0044, 0046, 0066, 0074, 0081, 0095, 0176, 0186, 0198, 0203, 0206, 0210, 0211, 0219, 0225, 0238, 0240, 0241, 0249, 0270, 0292, 0354, 0356, 0379, 0404, 0411 and 0436. Part I, Section B of this document references the AFSOC Prioritized list. <br /><br />Technical POCs: <br />Ralph Kohler <br />AFRL/RISD <br />315-330-2016 <br /><a href="mailto:ralph.kohler@rl.af.mil">ralph.kohler@rl.af.mil</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />or<br /><br />Eric Werkowitz<br />AFRL/RWAV<br />850-883-8541<br /><a href="mailto:eric.werkowitz@eglin.af.mil">eric.werkowitz@eglin.af.mil</a><br /><br /><strong>RESEARCH AREA 4 - OPTICS AND DISPLAYS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the area of handheld and wearable optics and displays. To improve the capabilities and effectiveness of the Battlefield Airmen, research areas proposed may include multi-spectral, day or night, color and fused capabilities. There is significant benefit in the ability to integrate on- and off-board system information through integrated symbology. The objective is to conduct research which could lead to the development of systems that will aid the dismounted Battlefield Airmen in their ability to detect, locate, georegister, designate, classify and assess targets in all environments. The ability to detect and identify through obscurants and camouflage while remaining undetected by enemy personnel is also desired. Reductions in volume and weight of equipment are key considerations. This research area addresses deficiencies 0127, 0157, 0361, 0375, 0405 0406 and 0409 from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of sensors and navigational aids to enhance the safety, survivability, and capabilities of the deployed Battlefield Airmen. The objective is to conduct research and development that improves our ability to emplace and maintain remote sensors that operate autonomously and in all weather and environments. These sensors shall feed collected information to the Global Information Grid (GIG) for dissemination to air, sea, and ground systems in near real time and will leverage advances in imaging and sensing technology to increase situational awareness across the force. Research to develop multispectral, all weather, covert visual and electronic navigational aids and technology to aid in employing these devices may be proposed. Threat situational awareness advancements may also be proposed that alert friendly forces in the event threat forces are targeting them by laser, ladar, Radio Frequencies (RF) or any other means. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0066, 0157, 0292, 0352, 0356, 0358, 0361, 0363, 0405 and 0406.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RESEARCH AREA 6 - TACTICAL ENERGY</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can generate reliable, energy that is compatible with current and future SOF C4 systems, sensors, and BA equipment. Additionally, the capability to generate Low Probability of Detection (LPD) high and low-density power used at deployed and/or remote locations is, at times, mission essential and impacts a wide variety of BA mission areas. The objective is to conduct research that would eventually lead to development of rugged, light-weight, extended-life power sources. The solution(s) should be light-weight, minimize overall volume as much as possible, reduce the frequency of resupply, and increase the duration of surface operations worldwide. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List: 0096, 0175, 0210, 0211, 0241, 0272, 0351, 0357, 0359, 0401, 0404 and 0427.

<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can provide improved clandestine, long-range ground and water mobility platforms that can be inserted via all SOF air assets. Current mobility platforms are becoming obsolete as new detection technologies make vehicle movement more observable than in the past. The objective is to conduct research that would lead to the modification of existing ground/water platforms or development of new ground/water platforms with reduced signatures (heat, acoustic, electromagnetic, and other emissions) capable of operating for extended durations/ranges. The focus should be on detection avoidance and solutions that reduce signatures to cloak SOF presence in the area of operations. These technologies must be rugged, lightweight, compact, waterproof, and operable in all light and weather conditions and must be comparable or better in performance (speed, capacity, armor, weapon integration, etc.) than current capabilities. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List: 0089, 0394, 0399, and 0415.

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 8 - MEDICAL</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the areas of medical equipment, remote diagnostics, prioritized casualty assessment, and patient/casualty extraction. The objective is to conduct research which could lead to development of synthetic blood replacement fluids, non-invasive administering techniques, improved pharmaceuticals, and bio-threat prophylaxis that address emerging and evolving biological threats. Research in the area of telemedicine to assess and intervene will greatly enhance patient survivability in austere environments. Applicable development areas and related systems should not interfere with tactical communications capabilities. Improvements in tactical medical equipment and portable diagnostic equipment that is smaller and lighter will reduce carried weight and volume. Systems that can be remotely manipulated will allow standoff treatment of contaminated personnel. Research on forensic collection, analysis, and databases will provide near real time assessment necessary for sensitive site exploitation operations. Research in improving patient extraction from austere locations and advancements in utilization of the CV-22 as an extraction platform may be addressed. . This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0096, 0134, 0175, 0268, 0269, 0270, 0271, 0272, 0357, 0362, 0414 and 0418.

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 9 - TACTICAL METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research for technologies that can improve weather collection, communication and transmission systems and/or sensors. Technologies should be developed to collect, automatically and accurately measure, and securely transmit weather information (surface and upper atmosphere conditions) and Meteorological and Oceanograhic (METOC) data across the battlespace from any location and in any environment. Sensors should have the capability to be emplaced either remotely or by hand, turned on and off remotely, and should be small, lightweight, long endurance and when possible, include camouflage or deception capabilities to avoid detection. The capability to create a weather state depiction for use on common mission planning, mission rehearsal and operational C2 platforms with the capability to be automatically updated in real or near-real time is also desired. All systems and sensors should be standardized and networked to existing and future C2 systems so the data can be provided in real or near-real-time to staff commanders, operators, planners, weather forces, and global weather databases. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List: 0023, 0046, 0205, 0210 and 0355. Part I, Section B of this document references the AFSOC Prioritized list.</p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH AREA 10 - ALTERNATE MEANS OF INSERTION AND EXTRACTION</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this work is to perform basic and applied research in the area of alternate insertion and extraction (AIE) methods to improve, augment, or replace current systems and methods. Current capabilities include but are not limited to rope ladder, fast rope, hoist, SCUBA, HALO (High Altitude Low Opening), HAHO (High Altitude High Opening), and static line parachute operations. The objective is to conduct research which could lead to development of new and enhanced capabilities and equipment that aid in mounted, dismounted, and airborne ingress/egress operations on land, sea, and air. Research to enhance survivability for the dismounted surface, sub-surface, and airborne operator that would reduce visual, thermal, and electromagnetic signature of the operator moving in both permissive and non-permissive environments is desired. Innovative research in improved systems for rapid, safe, and clandestine insertion and extraction may also be proposed. This research area addresses the following deficiencies from the AFSOC Prioritized Deficiency List (may not be all inclusive): 0089, 0294, 0362, 0394, 0395, 0399 and 0415. Part I, Section B of this document references the AFSOC Prioritized list.</p>

<p><strong>A. Criteria</strong>: The following five criteria, listed in descending order of importance, and an assessment of risk, will be used to determine whether full proposals will be invited based on the white paper submitted. The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. These criteria will also be used to evaluate formal proposals, should they be requested. <br /><br /><strong>1. Evaluation Criteria:</strong><br /><br />a. An integrated assessment of the proposed approach to include scientific and/or technical merits, associated risks, and the potential contributions of the effort to meet/fulfill Battlefield Air Operations Kit (Battlefield Airmen and Security Forces) mission requirements. Potential value to the government (technical promise) will be assessed, based on innovation (originality and feasibility), transitionability, and desirability to the warfighter.<br /><br />b. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives.</p>
<p>c. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.</p>
<p>d. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror, if any, and the availability of funds (i.e., considering budgets and funding).</p>
<p>e. The extent to which the proposal supports government field testing when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> Proposal risk for technical, cost, schedule, and other will be assessed as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff.</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual white papers/proposals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>It is the policy of AFRL/RW to treat all white papers and proposals as privileged information, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Those selected as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified Government scientists. The offeror must appropriately indicate any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the white paper or proposal (see also paragraph IV.B. above). Should portions of a proposal be incorporated into a resulting contract, that portion may be subject to release under the Freedom of Information Act unless exempt from release.</p>
<p><strong>B. Review and Selection Process:</strong> The evaluation described above will generally result in white papers being placed in one of the three Categories below:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Category I</strong></span>: Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Category II</span></strong>: Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Category III</span></strong>: Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.</p>
<p><strong>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Award Notices (White Papers):</strong> Offerors of those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the Contracting Office. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting offeror will be awarded a contract. Offerors of those white papers not selected for further consideration will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors may request status of their white paper no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p><strong>B. Award Notices (full proposals):</strong> Offerors will be notified whether their proposal is recommended for award after evaluation of the proposal. The notification is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract is assured, as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award.</p>
<p><strong>C. Administrative and National Policy Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a classified facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to information at the equivalent level of security at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p><strong>D. Reporting:</strong> Contractors should expect any contract or assistance instrument resulting from this BAA would contain the requirement to provide various types of periodic and final technical reports, and possibly cost and other reports.</p>
<p><strong>E. Data Rights Assertions:</strong> It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The contractor shall identify data rights assertions, licenses, patents, etc. that apply to any proprietary materials, technical data, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime or subcontractor(s) in the performance of this program; and shall address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral toa resulting contract.

<p><strong>VIII. OTHER INFORMATION PERTINENT TO AWARD OF CONTRACTS AND/OR ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Support Contractors:</strong> Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The AFRL Munitions Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: <br />1. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files;<br />2. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and<br />3. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.<br />Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p><strong>B. Communication:</strong> Dialogue between prospective offerors and Government representatives is encouraged until submission of proposals. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p><strong>C. Debriefings:</strong> When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content may vary to be consistent with the procedures that govern BAAs (FAR 35.016).</p>
<p><strong>D. Wide Area Work Flow Notice</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. The clause cites three possible electronic formats through which to submit electronic payment requests. Effective 01 October 2006, the Department of Defense adopted Wide Area Work Flow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA), as the electronic format for submission of electronic payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to use WAWF-RA for invoicing and receipt/acceptance, and provide coding instructions applicable to this contract. Contractors are encouraged to take advantage of available training (both web-based and through your cognizant DCMA office), and to register in the WAWF-RA system. Information regarding WAWF-RA, including the web-based training and registration, can be found at https://wawf.eb.mil/ . Note: WAWF-RA requirement does not apply to Universities that are audited by an agency other than DCAA.</p>
<p><strong>E. Item Identification and Valuation</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Aug 2008) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, "the government's unit acquisition cost is the contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost at time of delivery to the government for cost type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items" (per DoD, "fully burdened unit costs" to the government would include all direct, indirect, G&amp;A costs, and an appropriate portion of fee). If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/sitemap.html .</p>
<p><strong>F. Forward Pricing Rate Agreements</strong>: If formal proposals are requested, offerors who have Forward Pricing Rate Agreements (FPRAs) should submit them with their proposals.</p>
<p><strong>G. Pre-Award Clearance</strong>: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Program's (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Preaward Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past 2 years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p><strong>H. Excessive Pass-Through Charges</strong>: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.215-7004, Excessive Pass-Through Charges, (May 2008) which requires the contractor to identify in its proposal the percentage of effort to be performed by the prime contractor and the percentage expected to be performed by each subcontractor. If the contractor intends to subcontract more than 70% of the total cost of work under the contract or task order, then it shall identify the amount of the contractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the contractor. If any subcontractor intends to subcontract to a lower tier subcontractor more than 70% of the total cost of its work, then it shall identify the amount of the subcontractor's indirect costs and profit applicable to the lower tier subcontract work, and a description of the value added by the subcontractor. <br /><br /><strong>I. Associate Contractor Agreements:</strong> Associate Contractor Agreements (ACAs) are agreements between contractors working on government contract projects that specify requirements for them to share information, data, technical knowledge, expertise, or resources. The contracting officer may require ACAs when contractors working on separate government contracts must cooperate, share resources or otherwise jointly participate in working on contracts or projects. Prime contractor to subcontractor relationships do not constitute ACAs. For each award, the contracting officer will identify associate contractors with whom agreements are required.</p>
<p><strong>J. Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation</strong>: As prescribed in FAR 19.308, FAR Clause 52.219-28, Post-Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation (Apr 2009), is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. This clause will be contained in any contracts resulting from this solicitation. This clause requires a contractor to rerepresent its size status when certain conditions apply. The clause provides detail on when the rerepresentation must be complete and what the contractor must do when a rerepresentation is required.</p>
<p><strong>K. Enabling Clause:</strong> Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at AFMCFARS 5352.215-9008, Enabling Clause between Prime Contractors and Service Contractors, (Jul 1997), substantially as written, in Section I when a prime contractor must agree to cooperate with a support contractor during the performance of this contract. <br /><br />L.

<DESC>The 309th Aircraft Maintenance Group is seeking quote for the purchase of one (1) F-16 Milling Table, PAR System part number 07448730. The proposed item shall include all freight and handling charges delivered to building 265 on Hill AFB, UT 84056.
<p>PAR System part # 07448730 is considered the only one responsible source for the purchase of the F-16 Milling Table as authorized under 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B). This purchase is a follow on contract #FA8224-07-C-5018 for the purchase of an additional table to help increase the workload or production of these wings at faster rate. The existing table and requested table contain PAR Systems proprietary information and PAR Systems owns the design and calculations. The Government has no design specification and drawings in their possession of this table. We could solicit to another company, but this would be extremely costly due to the need to reverse engineer the existing table. Hence the awarding to any other source would result in duplication of engineering, design and prototyping. These costs would not be recovered through the use of open completion.</p>
<p>Solicitation FA8224-10-T-0037 RFQ should be submitted by 10:00 am MDT on 17 May 10. Please refer to the solicitation for more detailed information. The Contract Negotiator information is listed below:</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) anticipates award of a modification to contract W911W6-09-D-0007, an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with L-3 Communications, to increase the maximum value by $40,050,000 to a total value of $50,000,000.  The objectives of this program are to procure engineering support services, and hardware including, but not limited to VORTEX radios associated hardware, in support of demonstration and fielding of the capability on Army and other DoD aircraft to both transmit and receive video and data from current U.S. Army UAS and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64D Apaches in the Ku, C, S, and L frequency bands. The ability to transmit and receive video on all of these frequencies in one component is a vital distinction differentiating the VORTEX radio from other available products.  A flight test will be performed of the system providing level 2 control.  The system must also provide the capability to transmit ownship Mast Mounted Sight (MMS) sensor video to the OSRVT operators and VUIT-2 equipped AH-64Ds.  The system will display both received video and position data on the aircraft Lightweight Color Multi-Function Displays (LWCMFD).  As well as viewing this data the pilot/copilot must be able to control all of the systems functionality while the aircraft is in flight.  Due to size and space limitations of the aircraft, the system must occupy a minimal size and weight footprint.  The system must be compatible with OSRVT software to ensure commonality with all U.S. Army UAS, VUIT-2 Apaches, and OSRVTs.  The contract will support projects to demonstrate and provide the capability to other Army or DoD aircraft.  The increase in the ceiling will allow continued support to demonstrations and fielding of this capability on various Army and other DoD aircraft.  A sole source award per 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  AATD Orders will be issued on a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) or firm fixed price (FFP) basis.  L3 Communications is deemed to be the only responsible source uniquely capable of meeting this requirement without a substantial duplication of cost and schedule.  The development of these systems to provide the same functionality within a single component would require duplication of cost and take significant additional time and delay implementation of this critical capability that reduces operational risk to aircraft and Soldiers. Market research has identified L3 Communications as the only manufacturer with knowledge, experience and as the original designer and manufacturer of the VORTEX system.  L3 Communications has sole access to the technical specification, the design an intellectual property to the VORTEX system equipment.  Alpha contract negotiations, appropriate for sole source requirements, will be limited to L3 Communications.  The contract terms and conditions will be developed jointly between the Government and L3 Communications consistent with alpha contracting procedures in accordance with the FAR.  The ordering period for this IDIQ is sixty (60) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541330.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any responsible source may submit a proposal that shall be considered.  Written proposals should be submitted no later than May 14, 2010 at 12:00 p.m. EDT to U S Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Center, AATD, ATTN:  CCAM-RDT Beth Jackson, Bldg. 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  Ms. Jacksons phone number is 757-878-2100.  Anyone desiring an explanation or interpretation of this announcement must request it in writing at the above address, fax 757-878-0008 or Email elizabeth.a.jackson@us.army.mil.

<p>GLOSSARY</p>
<p>******************************************************************************<br />PACKAGING TEXT</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH APPLIES TO ALL PACKAGING CALLED OUT IN THIS DOCUMENT:</p>
<p>For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,<br />which includes either Depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-<br />Direct) shipments, both DoD linear and two-dimensional (2D)<br />bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels<br />in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December<br />15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the<br />requirement for MSL and 2D symbols). See the DLA packaging<br />web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change<br />notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply. 2D bar coding shall be<br />in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3)<br />and DoD 4500.9-R. MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar<br />coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388. Shipping<br />label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002. Bar code print<br />quality shall meet ANSI MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000)<br />for applicable 2D and/or linear bar codes. All DVD shipments<br />shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD<br />52.211-9010(C). Except for the Transportation Control Number<br />(TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping<br />Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as<br />defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available<br />from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the field is<br />not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be<br />left blank. If there are inconsistencies between the schedule<br />and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION TEXT</p>

<p>REFERENCE NUMBER IA061:</p>
<p>ADEQUATE DATA FOR EVALUATION OF ALTERNATE<br />OFFERS IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE PROCUREMENT<br />AGENCY. THE OFFEROR MUST PROVIDE A COMPLETE<br />DATA PACKAGE INCLUDING DATA FOR THE APPROVED AND<br />ALTERNATE PART FOR EVALUATION.</p>

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupy approximately 3,175 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space in a building under lease at 143 Laura Drive, Thibodeaux, Louisiana.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location. .  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
	North by Forty Arpent Rd
	East by Paul Lane

	West by Hwy 3266
Other applicable requirements include:
-	Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
-	Parking  20 on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control
The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.
EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Price and Technical.  Technical is significantly less important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offerors initial quote should contain the Offerors best terms from a price standpoint.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR><BR>Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM) Risk Vulnerability Assessment (VA)<BR><BR>1.0  DESCRIPTION OF WORK<BR><BR>1.1  Introduction<BR><BR>The objective of this effort is to identify TIC/TIM vulnerabilities attributed to both intentional and non-intentional threats, assess the risk for each finding, and recommend practical control/mitigation options that enable risk managers to determine the best allocation of limited resources to protect people and mission-critical systems and services.  Although not a formal inspection, the effort also assists installations by identifying Anti-Terrorism (AT)/Force Protection (FP) vulnerabilities with other installation VAs and for inclusion into the Core Vulnerability Assessment Management Program (CVAMP). <BR><BR>1.2  Background<BR><BR>AFI 41-106, Medical Readiness Planning and Training requires the installation Bioenvironmental Engineer to conduct an annual assessment of local industrial facilities (on and off base) that may be of consequence to base operations if toxic TIC/TIM are released and report results to the MRSF and Wing Force Protection Working Group.  AFTTP 3-42.2 requires medics to conduct TIC/TIM VAs in a deployed environment.  DoD Instruction 2000.16, DoD Antiterrorism Standards, requires AT VAs provide a vulnerability-based analysis of an activity's AT program. The assessment identifies, for the commander, vulnerabilities that may be exploited by terrorists and suggests options that may eliminate or mitigate those vulnerabilities.   Additionally, ASTM standard E2413-04, Standard Guide for Hospital Preparedness and Response, recommends healthcare facilities conduct a hazard vulnerability analysis to ensure proper planning for a variety of incidents.  <BR><BR>1.3  Scope <BR><BR>The objective of this work is to conduct a TIC/TIM VA and training at Warfield AFB, MD.  The project will include threat identification and assessment, effects-based modeling and hazard projections, determination of probability of events that could present the threat, and determination of risk from each threat.  The most up-to-date guidance shall be used in completing the effort IAW AFI 10-2501 and AFI 48-106.  Major planning, data gathering, and information processing tasks associated with the TIC/TIM VA are outlined in Section 3.0, Technical Requirements.  To minimize stakeholder interruptions and optimize efficiencies, information requests, interviews, and other activities will be consolidated where appropriate during the combined effort.  Reports will be completed for the TIC/TIM VA are outlined in Section 4.2, Technical Reporting Requirements.<BR><BR>The TIC/TIM VA is an assessment required by AFI 41-106 and compliments the installation-level VA required annually by AFI 10-245.  This VA can serve as a baseline assessment for subsequent updates on an annual basis until the need for a new baseline is determined by the presiding installation Bioenvironmental Engineer or Anti Terrorism Officer.     <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>2.0  APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS. <BR><BR>In performance of the effort associated with this Statement of Work (SOW), the contractor shall apply all relevant criteria derived from Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force (AF), MAJCOM, Department of Justice (DOJ), and primacy agency policies, directives, and instructions.

THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil
It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial ItemsNOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
     (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE    (ii)  PRICE
(b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iii), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  
(d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.

Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractors proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractors technical proposal.

Price Risk:  The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.  Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.

52.212-2   EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
 The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.

(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

RATING METHODOLOGY     	
 
All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, with the exception of  Past Performance which may be rated neutral.

The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offerors technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Unacceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

OUTSTANDING  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the superior
achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of OUTSTANDING
indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.

GOOD  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the
objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.

 ACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional 	features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks of failure.

 UNACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate to excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating  indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. The Offerors interpretation of the Governments objective is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.

NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is
neither favorable nor unfavorable.

Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation teams assessment of the
technical proposal for accomplishing the Governments objectives.

Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.

<DESC>FAXED OR EMAILED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED


*****PLEASE NOTE******
THIS CONTRACT REQUIRES (1) 200 cube Pick Up Truck with Camper Shell or Van. 


Enclosed please find the formal solicitation package you requested. The Postal Service has determined that Highway Contract Route (HCR) transportation services will no longer be advertised to the public as an Invitation to Bid. Accordingly, this solicitation is being offered to the public as a Request for Proposal. There are significant changes in this process. Some of these changes are as follows:

1. As stated under Clause 2.2.8 in the Terms and Conditions, the Postal Service has implemented a program under which postal highway contract route (HCR) suppliers will obtain fuel at certain designated wholesale fuel servicing facilities and retail fuel servicing facilities; all suppliers are required to participate in the Fuel Management Program (see the Fuel Management Program document enclosed dated December 31, 2009). For evaluation purposes, the contract baseline fuel price per gallon will be determined by the Contracting Officer based on the fueling locations provided by the HCR supplier on the enclosed Fuel Purchase Form (HC 131). The contracting officer will use the average quarterly Department of Energy Regional Fuel Index cost per gallon on the solicitation closing date to evaluate proposals (based on the Fuel Purchase Form submitted). For bulk fuel purchases, the quarterly average USPS Bulk Fuel Program Price Per Gallon will be used for proposal evaluation. Therefore, for line 6 (fuel) on Form 7468A, Highway Transportation Contract  Bid or Renewal Worksheet, the supplier should include the number of gallons only; the cost per gallon and total cost should be set to zero ($0.00).

2. All parties submitting a proposal will continue to receive a formal notification of contract award. The notification will identify the successful vendor and price.

3. Under Clause 2.1, as stated in the Terms and Conditions, this is a fixed rate contract for highway transportation service to be provided according to the Statement of work and Specifications indicated in the solicitation, schedule, and special notes. The basis for payment established for this contract is stated in the solicitation. No adjustments will be made in contract price except as provided under other clauses of this contract.

4. The solicitation may require a supplier to submit with their proposal information that was not previously requested in advance of the closing date. The vendor must carefully review Section 3.1.2 of the HCR Terms and Conditions (February 26, 2010) for Information to be provided. 
5. Section 2.3.3a of the terms and conditions, Termination with Notice, is incorporated in this contract; Section
2.3.3b, Termination for the Postal Service's convenience, does not apply.

The Postal Service reserves the right to award this solicited service with or without discussions.


Once the contract has been awarded, adjustments to the bottom line can be made only in accordance with Management Instructions on Economic Adjustments. If you do not understand the adjustment process, contact the office that published the solicitation for an explanation prior to preparing your offer.

Please ensure completion prior to submission of your quote. Also note that paragraph (b) of FAR 52.204-8, applies.</p>
<p>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />Pursuant to the requirements of the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) as implemented by FAR Subpart 6.3, HSAR 3006.3, HSAM 3006.3, CGAP 1206.3, and in accordance with (IAW) requirements of FAR 6.303-1, the justification for the use of the statutory authority under FAR Subpart 6.302-1 is justified by the following facts and rationale required under FAR 6.303-2 as follows: <br />1) Agency and Contracting Activity: <br />The US Coast Guard, Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), proposes to purchase equipment on a basis other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved: <br />Procurement of brand specific and model specific radio VHF receivers and associated equipment for installation at a Vessel Traffic Service San Francisco during the VTS San Francisco relocation project.</p>
<p>3)Description-of-Supplies: <br />The proposed acquisition consists of the following:</p>
<p>Item 1-6 each Desk Enclosure Zetron PN#815-9172 <br />Item 2 -9 each Channel Check Instant Recall Zetron PN# 930-0052<br />Item 3-6 each Foot Switch Zetron PN# 950-9102<br />4) Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:<br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." <br />Section (ii) "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in-<br />(AA) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition..." is directly applicable.<br /><br />5) Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: <br />Congress has directed the Coast Guard to actively manage commercial vessel traffic in particular ports. RADIO communication is a required and critical function of commercial vessel traffic management. The RADIO system needs to be powerful enough to receive and transmit in the vessel traffic area and be configurable to transceive on all the channels assigned to the area without interfering with non-assigned channels. The Coast Guard tasked C2CEN with providing the equipment and systems necessary to achieve the required vessel traffic management.</p>
<p>It was determined that deploying the same RADIO system in the ports would minimize support costs, operator training costs, maintenance costs, depot sparing costs, and technician training costs. The selected RADIO system was also required to be compatible with the infrastructure at the ports and meet all the Coast Guard configuration and security requirements. The Zetron system was selected and has already been deployed in most Vessel Traffic ports. Systems acquired from Zetron are configured in accordance with Zetron build number 178103. For compatibility, all systems should be configured in accordance with build number 178103.</p>
<p>The San Francisco site is moving from its existing location to a new location. The RADIO system at the current site is due to be replaced with the Zetron system. This acquisition shall acquire the Zetron system which has been manufacturer configured to build number 178103. The system shall be installed at the new site. Once installed and tested, the RADIO at the existing site shall be used for VTS Houston relocation project.</p>
<p>6) Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable: <br />Zetron communication controller parts are available from several sources of supply. The alternate sources may not supply all the items necessary to be properly configured. This procurement will be advertised on FED BIZ OPS.</p>
<p>7) Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: <br />Fairness of price is based on past purchases of similar equipment, price comparison with other vendors and with similar products.</p>
<p>8) Description of Market Research:<br />This equipment will be replaced only when it is no longer available, does not meet new VTS requirements, or cost increases substantially. Until then, market research is limited to the cost associated with acquiring the system and its components.<br /><br />9) Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: <br />Reengineering the Vessel Traffic System to include new communication controllers would involve considerable rework and expense: the purchase of spares for the depot, and retraining of maintenance personnel would cost &gt;$150,000.00. Deploying a new system in all the affected ports would require technical research into alternative systems, site visits to determine local site configuration problems and site visits to install the new equipment. At each site, the operators and support technicians would need to be trained on the new equipment before installation.</p>
<p>10) A Listing of the Sources, if Any, That Expressed, in Writing, An Interest in the Acquisition:<br />No other interest has been expressed, at this time. <br /><br />11) A Statement of the Actions, if Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for Supplies or Services Required: <br />Establishment of a different VHF audio comms control, and built-in-test standard would allow direct replacement with another vendor's radio, however it would incur significant additional development and training costs.</p>
<p>12) This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. The anticipated cost to the Government is determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>James A. Lassiter, signature<br />ContractingOfficer</p>
<p>I certify this procurement meets the Government's minimum need and that the supporting data, which forms a basis for this justification, is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledgeandbelief.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131)<br />1900 Half St., S.W. (JR11-0203)<br />Washington, D.C., 20593<br />Telephone: 202-372-3692<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).    (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

The Alpha/Beta implementation of  LIMS is in progress and the LSRP is evaluating go-forward technology options that will exceed the strategic goals established in the project's cost benefit analysis (CBA) justification and long-term deployment sustainment requirements.The VA is currently confronted with the decision to acquire and build the primary domain and disaster recovery infrastructure, as well as the decision to invest in personnel and training for the system technical staff and application support staff required to maintain the Cerner Millennium environment. This decision is not just limited to the initial capital cost of equipment and future hardware technology upgrades and refreshes, but also must address data center operations management, cost, security, space, HVAC, and power. One of the significant concerns facing VA is sourcing the experienced technical staff to support Millennium PathNet's on-going technical operations in addition to application support staff to support the day to day application once fielded. To further complicate the issue, these staffing decisions may be subject to constant personnel turnover due to contracting polices and/or terms. Labor is not only a considerable portion of the ongoing costs, it is sometimes the difference between an organization's deployment success and failure.2.0 	OBJECTIVEThe objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to acquire contract support to assist the Laboratory Systems Re-engineering Project (LSRP) by providing Alpha/Beta remote hosting services for the Cerner Millennium PathNet system and systems and application management support for this solution.3.0 	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTSDocuments referenced or germane to this PWS are listed below.

<DESC>AMENDED SOLICITATION IS ATTACHED, CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS:<BR>1.  AMENDMENT WAS NECESSARY TO CORRECT WAGE DETERMINATION LOCATION AND NUMBER FROM SALISBURY, SC 2005-2473 TO SALISBURY, NC 2005-2391<BR>2.  AMENDMENT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE SECTION 3.6 OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT, REVISED PWS ATACHED.  CHANGES HILIGHTED IN YELLOW.<BR>3.  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION-QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE BELOW.<BR>NO OTHER CHANGES ARE MADE TO THIS SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.<BR><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION #1--QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<BR><BR>Question 1:  Wage Determination:  I dont believe the referenced wage determination is correct.  You list: Salisbury, SC, Dorchester County 2005-2473.  I think the wage determination should be: WD 05-2391<BR><BR>Answer 1:  You are correct; this will be covered in the next amendment.<BR><BR>Question 2:  Previous Contract Vehicle.  Most of this work appears to have been done previously (currently) under the US Air Force CFT contract.  Under the CFT contract, Employees provided common hand tools, but expendables, supplies, materials, and specialty tools are Government furnished or reimbursed at cost and your paragraph 4.8 appears to continue this approach.  However, the OC-ALC clauses included in the contract (OC-ALC 07-040 and OC-ALC 07-07-043) are CFT contract specific clauses.  Could you please provide these clauses in full text in the solicitation or replace them with full text terms and condition of your contract? We do not have access to the CFT contract documents.  Also, there is no discussion if the contractor can recover G&A costs on the contractor obtained materials.<BR>.<BR>Answer 2: You are correct; these clauses will be removed in the next amendment.  These should not have been in the Performance Work Statement.  There should be no G&A cost in that AVCRAD will provide all materials.<BR><BR>Question 3:  Previous Contract Vehicle, Labor.  The CFT contract has its own wage determination and is an even numbered AWD allowing the contractor to pool the H&W benefit and the H&W benefit is paid on all hours worked, including overtime.  Your solicitation is using even numbered AWDs which require H&W benefits be paid to each employee on an hours paid basis, up to 2080 hours per year. Also, wages are higher on the CFT AWD.  Could you please provide a matrix identifying which sites have a workforce that is currently employed by a CFT contractor under the CFT contract?<BR><BR>Answer 3:  This will not be provided.  The matrix provided in the Performance Based Work Statement is representative of the current staff with only a few minor exceptions<BR><BR>Question 4:  Wage Determinations. Please consider replacing the odd numbered AWDs with even numbered AWDs so we can continue to pool the H&W benefit vs. providing them to individuals.  There is no wage or vacation accrual difference, but it allows us to be more flexible to providing benefits to the workforce.  Also, there should be no negative impact to the Government on price.<BR><BR>Answer 4:  This will not be amended at this time.  We are using the Wage Determinations set by the Service Contract Act and the Wage Determination Online (www.wdol.gov/sca.aspx#8).  Though services have been previously performed at these locations, there is no documentation indicating that the services were previously performed under an SCA wage determination that ends in an even number (which is the wage determinations that are grandfathered into current contracts and services).<BR><BR>Question 5:  Proposal Format.  The proposal format and instructions are very clear.  However, the proposal font size, margins are not provided and there are no page limits imposed.  Could you please identify font size, margins and provide a page limit for each section.<BR><BR>Answer 5:  There is no specific requirement for this.<BR><BR>Question 6:  Will invoice be processed through WAWF (Wide Area Work Flow)?<BR><BR>Answer 6:  Once awarded, the invoicing will be sent directly to the Mississippi USPFO and will be addressed in the final contract.   However, during the life of this contract the Government anticipates implementation of WAWF for invoice processing.  When this occurs the contractor shall implement WAWF procedures as described below at no additional cost to the Government.<BR>

It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial ItemsNOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.  
(i)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM(ii)	ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FOB TERMS(iii)	PAST PERFORMANCE(iv)	PRICE
(b)  Ability to meet both (i) technical capability to perform and (ii) ability to meet the required delivery schedule and FOB terms represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically acceptable to be performing under Factors (i) and (ii) will be further evaluated under Factors (iii) and (iv).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) and (ii) to be technically acceptable, Factor (iii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is as important as Factor (iv), PRICE.  
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from a price, delivery and technical standpoint.   
(c)  By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  
(d) The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is shown in herein.  FOB terms are shown in herein.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  
(e) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM and ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FOB TERMS represents the MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under these factors, offers will be determined to be either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined acceptable under these factors will render the offer unacceptable and not considered for award.  
(f)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior same and/or similar contracts performed within the past three years. 
PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
UNSATISFACTORY:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.

(g)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

The incident rate equates to the number of incidents multiplied by 200,000 hours divided by the number of hours worked (number of incidents x 200,000 hours/ number of hours worked). 

TAB/FACTOR 8:  PAST PERFORMANCE 
	
Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance, and that of significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, under existing or prior contracts for services.  Past performance information will be used in making responsibility determination and to assess the capabilities of the offerors in order to assure the selection of the proposal offering the greatest value to the Government.  The Government will direct its inquiry to the past performance of the offeror, and its proposed significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, as such performance relates to the solicitation requirements.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates the quality of performance relative to the size, content, and complexity of the requirements.  In particular, information on the following areas of contract performance will be collected and evaluated:

	1)  Conformance to specifications and standards of good workmanship.

	2)  Adherence to contract schedules

	3)  Compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract

	4)  General business conduct and business-like concern for the customer

The contractor evaluation form, included as attachment 4 will be used to collect information as to the quality of past performance of the offeror, including subcontractors providing significant services and /or affiliates.

If a significant portion of the work to be performed is proposed to be accomplished by subcontractors or affiliates of the offeror, three (3) contractor evaluation  forms shall be submitted by customers of the proposed subcontractor(s) or affiliate(s).  Offerors shall include in their proposal, the written consent of their proposed significant subcontractors to allow the Government to discuss the subcontractors past performance evaluation with the offeror during the discussion (negotiation) phase of this procurement if the Government conducts discussions.  Offerors shall include with their proposal, a list of the firms that will submit evaluation forms.  Other references, aside from those provided by the offeror, may be contacted and their comments considered to evaluate the offerors past performance during the source selection process.  The information submitted by the offeror may be verified by the Government though discussions with the references provided.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing relevant references that the Government can readily contact rests with the offeror. 

Volume II:  The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume II) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in 1. Pricing of the Solicitation and their proposed dollar amounts.   The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred.  The Offeror shall insert prices for all line items in 1. Pricing  for the base year and for each option year.

TAB/FACTOR 9:    PRICE

The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:

Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractors proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractors technical proposal.
Price Risk:  The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.  Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.

52.212-2   EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
 The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.

(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Factor 1	 -Top Secret Security Requirements    
Factor 2	 - Comparable Experience 
Factor 3	 - Technical Solution (custodial and snow removal plan of operation)	
Factor 4	 - Transition (Phase In/ Phase Out)
Factor 5	 - Management Structure and Key Personnel Responsibilities (Resumes)
Factor 6	 - Quality Control Plan
Factor 7	 - Safety and Environmental Program and Requirements
Factor 8	 - Past Performance 
Factor 9          - Price       

Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

The Offerors proposal shall meet the objectives outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and
provide the best value solution to the Government will be selected for award. The best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the stated objective.
	
The Government may conduct a price realism evaluation in order to determine if the overall price proposed is:
(1)	Realistic for the work to be performed;
(2)	Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements; and
(3)	Are consistent with the various elements of the Offerors technical proposal.

 (a) The Offerors proposal will be evaluated to determine whether it meets the requirements described in 	the solicitation. The Government will evaluate the Offerors capability and approach to meet the Governments objectives against the evaluation factors outlined in 52.212-2.

(b) A cost and/or price analysis shall be conducted based upon the data submitted by the Offeror in order to determine that the negotiated cost or price to be fair and reasonable.

RATING METHODOLOGY     	
 
All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, with the exception of  Past Performance which may be rated neutral.

The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offerors technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Unacceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

OUTSTANDING  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the superior
achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of OUTSTANDING
indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.

GOOD  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the
objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the 	submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.

 ACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional 	features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks of failure.

 UNACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate to excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating  indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. The Offerors interpretation of the Governments objective is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.

NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is
neither favorable nor unfavorable.

Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation teams assessment of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Governments objectives.

Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.

The incident rate equates to the number of incidents multiplied by 200,000 hours divided by the number of hours worked (number of incidents x 200,000 hours/ number of hours worked). 

TAB/FACTOR 8:  PAST PERFORMANCE 
	
Each offeror will be evaluated on its performance, and that of significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, under existing or prior contracts for services.  Past performance information will be used in making responsibility determination and to assess the capabilities of the offerors in order to assure the selection of the proposal offering the greatest value to the Government.  The Government will direct its inquiry to the past performance of the offeror, and its proposed significant subcontractors or affiliates, if any, as such performance relates to the solicitation requirements.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates the quality of performance relative to the size, content, and complexity of the requirements.  In particular, information on the following areas of contract performance will be collected and evaluated:

	1)  Conformance to specifications and standards of good workmanship.

	2)  Adherence to contract schedules

	3)  Compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract

	4)  General business conduct and business-like concern for the customer

If a significant portion of the work to be performed is proposed to be accomplished by subcontractors or affiliates of the offeror, three (3) contractor evaluation  forms shall be submitted by customers of the proposed subcontractor(s) or affiliate(s).  Offerors shall include in their proposal, the written consent of their proposed significant subcontractors to allow the Government to discuss the subcontractors past performance evaluation with the offeror during the discussion (negotiation) phase of this procurement if the Government conducts discussions.  Offerors shall include with their proposal, a list of the firms that will submit evaluation forms.  Other references, aside from those provided by the offeror, may be contacted and their comments considered to evaluate the offerors past performance during the source selection process.  The information submitted by the offeror may be verified by the Government though discussions with the references provided.  While the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing relevant references that the Government can readily contact rests with the offeror. 

Volume II:  The overall contents of the Price Proposal (Volume II) shall include the list of CLIN Items, shown in 1. Pricing of the Solicitation and their proposed dollar amounts.   The price proposal shall also break out those costs, specifically reflecting a break out of all costs incurred.  The Offeror shall insert prices for all line items in 1. Pricing  for the base year and for each option year.

TAB/FACTOR 9:    PRICE

The Government Evaluation Team may use all methods available to evaluate prices proposed including, but not limited to, an analysis based on the following:

Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to representative industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.
Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractors proposed price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the contractors technical proposal.
Price Risk:  The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.  Unrealistically low proposed prices, whether submitted initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirements.

52.212-2   EVALUATIONCOMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 
 The Government will evaluate the Base Year and Option Year cost as a total cost per award. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of option period pricing shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options for that year.

(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Factor 1	 -Top Secret Security Requirements

Factor 6	 - Quality Control Plan
Factor 7	 - Safety and Environmental Program and Requirements
Factor 8	 - Past Performance 
Factor 9          - Price       

Technical and past performances, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

 (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 

The Offerors proposal shall meet the objectives outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW) and
provide the best value solution to the Government will be selected for award. The best value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the stated objective.

(1)	Realistic for the work to be performed;
(2)	Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements; and
(3)	Are consistent with the various elements of the Offerors technical proposal.

 (a) The Offerors proposal will be evaluated to determine whether it meets the requirements described in 	the solicitation. The Government will evaluate the Offerors capability and approach to meet the Governments objectives against the evaluation factors outlined in 52.212-2.

(b) A cost and/or price analysis shall be conducted based upon the data submitted by the Offeror in order to determine that the negotiated cost or price to be fair and reasonable.

RATING METHODOLOGY     	
 
All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and/or Unacceptable, with the exception of  Past Performance which may be rated neutral.

The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offerors technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Unacceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:

OUTSTANDING  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the superior
achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of OUTSTANDING
indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.

GOOD  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the
objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the 	submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.

 ACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional 	features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks of failure.

 UNACCEPTABLE  The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate to excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating  indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, subfactor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths. The Offerors interpretation of the Governments objective is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.

NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
* This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is
neither favorable nor unfavorable.

Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation teams assessment of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Governments objectives.

Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.

The United States Army, ARDEC, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for developing low cost tungsten fragmented components using plastic binding. Candidate manufacturing techniques and designs are needed in support of this effort. 
The tungsten fragmented component utilizes two (2) grain sphere with a density of no less than 18g/cc. The component will be enclosed inside the munition and supported with surrounding metal components. The subject components must be robust throughout the handling, loading, ballistic setback and projectile flight and provide a reliable tungsten sphere separation during explosive event. To date, the components are manufactured using a sintered process with a copper binding the tungsten spheres.
The complete component shall meet the following requirement:  a. Maximum acceleration expected = 45,000 gs at temperatures of -25 to 125 F (-32 to 52 C)  
b. Maximum Rotational Pressure expected = 15,000 psi.  c. Survive rough handling and storage at temperatures -50 to 145 F (-46 to 63 C).  
d. Be compatible with steel and aluminum.  
e. Low moisture absorption in binding material.  
f. Ability to be manufactured in a high production environment. 
g. Ability to be made with radial contours. Final machining is allowed but not preferred.  
h. Approximate Total Length 3-5 inches. Approximate Diameter 2-3 inches. Min web sections to be greater than .100 inches. Max thickness of molded part is approximately 2.1 inches. 
i. Plastic binding materials must low shrinkage, be capable of retaining Tungsten spheres in a desired shape, and not have voids. 
j. All materials shall be inert. 
k. Be able to be stored in current Army ammunition facilities for more than 20 years without degradation in performance including ability to loading and ballistic performance.
Interested parties should submit candidate manufacturing techniques and designs for the low cost tungsten fragmented components. These submittals shall be in sufficient detail so that an evaluation can be performed to determine benefit to the program. The details are to include experience with candidate manufacturing, design(s), material(s) and data.
Any response to this market survey shall be submitted ELECTRONICALLY ONLY, and within thirty (30) days from the date of this notice to Matthew Endrizzi (email address: matt.endrizzi@us.army.mil).

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to TOMTEC INC, 1000 Sherman Ave, Hamden, CT 06514-1337. The purchase order is for the acquisition of Quadra 4 NS SPE instrument. The (CDC) reasonably believes that competition is impractical because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is a semi automated system which has no equivalent due to its capability, and incorporation into several CDC response methods.<br />2. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is unique because it can perform simplified solid phase extraction for microplate processing in a manner that other systems cannot.<br />3. The TOMTEC Quadra 4 is the only semi automated liquid handler that provides the ability to manually and semi automatically process liquid samples in a 96-well format.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The authority for sole source procurements is FAR part 6.302-1; only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting, or exceeding the requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement detailing their capability to include past performance information, which will be considered only if received by the Contracting Office by 11:59 p.m. eastern standard time on May 15, 2010. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Email capability statements and inquires to Russell Franklin by email to jpe6@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION #1-QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<BR><BR>Question 1:  Wage Determination:  I dont believe the referenced wage determination is correct.  You list: Salisbury, SC, Dorchester County 2005-2473.  I think the wage determination should be: WD 05-2391<BR><BR>Answer 1:  You are correct; this will be covered in the next amendment.<BR><BR>Question 2:  Previous Contract Vehicle.  Most of this work appears to have been done previously (currently) under the US Air Force CFT contract.  Under the CFT contract, Employees provided common hand tools, but expendables, supplies, materials, and specialty tools are Government furnished or reimbursed at cost and your paragraph 4.8 appears to continue this approach.  However, the OC-ALC clauses included in the contract (OC-ALC 07-040 and OC-ALC 07-07-043) are CFT contract specific clauses.  Could you please provide these clauses in full text in the solicitation or replace them with full text terms and condition of your contract? We do not have access to the CFT contract documents.  Also, there is no discussion if the contractor can recover G&A costs on the contractor obtained materials.<BR><BR>Answer 2: You are correct; these clauses will be removed in the next amendment.  These should not have been in the Performance Work Statement.  There should be no G&A cost in that AVCRAD will provide all materials.<BR><BR>Question 3:  Previous Contract Vehicle, Labor.  The CFT contract has its own wage determination and is an even numbered AWD allowing the contractor to pool the H&W benefit and the H&W benefit is paid on all hours worked, including overtime.  Your solicitation is using even numbered AWDs which require H&W benefits be paid to each employee on an hours paid basis, up to 2080 hours per year. Also, wages are higher on the CFT AWD.  Could you please provide a matrix identifying which sites have a workforce that is currently employed by a CFT contractor under the CFT contract?<BR><BR>Answer 3:  This will not be provided.  The matrix provided in the Performance Based Work Statement is representative of the current staff with only a few minor exceptions<BR><BR>Question 4:  Wage Determinations. Please consider replacing the odd numbered AWDs with even numbered AWDs so we can continue to pool the H&W benefit vs. providing them to individuals.  There is no wage or vacation accrual difference, but it allows us to be more flexible to providing benefits to the workforce.  Also, there should be no negative impact to the Government on price.<BR><BR>Answer 4:  This will not be amended at this time.  We are using the Wage Determinations set by the Service Contract Act and the Wage Determination Online (www.wdol.gov/sca.aspx#8).  Though services have been previously performed at these locations, there is no documentation indicating that the services were previously performed under an SCA wage determination that ends in an even number (which is the wage determinations that are grandfathered into current contracts and services).<BR><BR>Question 5:  Proposal Format.  The proposal format and instructions are very clear.  However, the proposal font size, margins are not provided and there are no page limits imposed.  Could you please identify font size, margins and provide a page limit for each section.<BR><BR>Answer 5:  There is no specific requirement for this.<BR><BR>Question 6:  Will invoice be processed through WAWF (Wide Area Work Flow)?<BR><BR>Answer 6:  Once awarded, the invoicing will be sent directly to the Mississippi USPFO and will be addressed in the final contract.   However, during the life of this contract the Government anticipates implementation of WAWF for invoice processing.  When this occurs the contractor shall implement WAWF procedures as described below at no additional cost to the Government.<BR>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS ONLY MADE AVAILABLE TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS CONSULTING GROUP (INSYSCO) FOR REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.

In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Pub.L. 111-5, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to an existing, competitively awarded task order.  Task Order 0006 was awarded to a women-owned small business after the requirement was competed using fair opportunity provisions outlined in FAR Part 16.  Task Order 0006 was awarded under an existing Total Information Processing Support Services-3 (TIPSS-3) Indefinite Delivery  Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract (TIRNO-06-D-00024).  The modification was executed as a fixed-price action.

The IRS Financial Management Information System (FMIS) is a set of production applications/activities that provides the data necessary to support and prepare the revenue and refund portion of the IRS custodial financial statement.  FMIS provides transaction detail reports and audit trails for all fiscal year cash receipts from Individual Master File (IMF), Business Master File (BMF), and Automated Non-Master File (ANMF) files. These include Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing (ISRP) deposits, Lockbox deposits, Manual Integrated Data Retrieval System (IDRS) deposits, Remittance Adjustments or Reversals and Electronic Federal Tax Payment deposits.   In addition the FMIS system captures all revenue reclassification amounts from the master files, all refunds, refund reversals, all assessment and abatement adjustment transactions, and all returns. 

This opportunity provides software development, testing, configuration management and project management support to the FMIS program.  The FMIS program is being expanded in response to legislative initiatives resulting from the enactment of ARRA.  ARRA initiatives related to Bond Rebates, Housing Credit, Health Care coverage provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) and Making Work Pay expand the information that FMIS must capture.

<DESC>TITLE: RECOVERY - TECHNICAL REVIEW VERTEBRATE ANIMAL WELFARE REQUIREMENTS
<p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health to modify ARRA contract No. HHSN276200900857P on a sole source basis.</p>
<p>The Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), OER, NIH, is responsible for the general administration and implementation of the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy). The Policy was promulgated in 1986 to implement the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 and requires institutions to establish and maintain proper measures to ensure the appropriate care and use of all animals involved in research, research training, and biological testing activities conducted or supported by the PHS. OLAW is responsible for the general administration and coordination of the Policy on behalf of the PHS.</p>
<p>Administration of the PHS Policy includes review of the Vertebrate Animal Section (VAS) of the PHS 398 grant application for those projects involving the use of live vertebrate animals in research. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of grants requiring review by OLAW personnel. This requirement leaves OLAW with the immediate need for professional support and expertise in handling NIH grant issues related to the appropriate completion of the VAS of the PHS 398 by extramural scientists.</p>
<p>The contractor James F. Taylor, currently reviews and analyzes Vertebrate Animal Sections of PHS 398 grant application documents for the Division of Assurances. The tasks include review of grant documents for appropriateness of sections describing animal use and communicate with OLAW personnel and support staff, review of grant data in IMPACII associated with requests from IC grants managers and specialists to provide or obtain data necessary to make award (ie, communicate through NIH grants officers, and grants management personnel to receive updated information from the grant applicant).</p>
<p>Due to the volume of grants documents submitted to OLAW by the Institutes and Centers, NIH requires additional professional staff support to the OLAW Division of Assurances on site or remotely for approximately 20 hours per month. The modification will be funded with ARRA funds.</p>
<p><br />This is not a RFP nor is an RFP available. All interested parties which can demonstrate their capabilities to provide the aforementioned modification may submit electronic responses to Ryan Singletary at ryan.singletary@nih.gov. Response must be received no later than 12:00 PM Easter, on May 6, 2010. Please reference notice number NLM-10-117 on all correspondence to this notice.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source as this contract is for utilities, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<BR><BR><BR>1.  CONTRACTING AGENCY -	Department of Army<BR>                   		     		US Army Corps of Engineers          		<BR>					Fort Worth District<BR>                    		     		Contracting Division<BR>			     		Fort Worth, Texas 76102<BR><BR>2.  DESCRIPTION OF ACTION  The approval is being requested for electrical improvements due funding received by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to renovate campgrounds at Proctor Lake.  Furnish all tools, labor, material and equipment to provide electrical system enhancements to Copperas Creek Park and Promontory Park. This improvement will include installation of two new metering points, replacing 11 pole transformers with ground mounted transformers, replacing two pole transformers and relocating two metering locations.  It is estimated to be completed within 18 months.  The schedule of this work will parallel the construction work to be initialized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  Jim Lester, Staking and Mapping Engineer for the Comanche Electric Cooperative Association, is the POC on this project and his contact number is 1-800-915-2533.  Value is not to exceed $80,000.<BR><BR>3.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES - Comanche Electric Cooperative Association (CECA) will be removing eight -167KVA & a 25KVA existing overhead transformers and poles, removing four poles with lighting arresters and removing two service poles, downgrading eight demand meters and removing 140 LF of primary line at the group use area.  CECA will be installing ten - 37.5KVA ground mounted transformers with concrete pads, two 25KVA ground mounted transformers with pads, four ground-mounted junction boxes with slabs, one steel pole with 37.5 KVA areal transformers and four steel posts around every pad transformer.  CECA will also install an estimated 559LF of primary line in Government provided pipe and ditch.  CECA will provide twelve 200-320 Amp meter bases and make all primary side connections and material for electrical service.<BR><BR>4.  AUTHORITY CITED - 10 USC 2304(c)1, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(b)(3); State and Federal agencies created franchise territory that dictate that one utility company will provide service and provide construction work on their system.<BR><BR>5.  REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED - Comanche Electric Cooperative Association is the owner of the power distributions lines in this area and has successfully operated and maintained hundreds of miles of electric power lines for decades.   The Texas Utility Commission requires CECA to own and maintain the existing power lines in this area; therefore, when a customer requests power changes to the existing lines, that customer is responsible for paying for any upgrades associated with the requirement.  All the work identified in this J&A will be preformed by CECA employees.<BR><BR>6.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION - Because of electrical deregulation, there are now many electric service providers for electricity (power), but only one owner of the power distribution lines in this area, which is CECA.  Therefore, any power work must be performed via CECA, as CECA will not allow another companies to upgrade or perform work their power lines.  <BR><BR>7.  ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION -   No other actions pursued to increase competition.  <BR>8.  MARKET RESEARCH -   The Government has contacted CECA and verified the information provided herein.<BR> 9.  INTERESTED SOURCES - The authority at 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), only one source can perform this particular requirement, because the power line ownership was not deregulated, and therefore the owner has the authority to allow or, as in this case, disallow another party to perform upgrades on the utility lines.  The notice will be published.<BR><BR>10.  OTHER FACTS - CECA has the necessary prerequisite knowledge of the power grid, system design and load capacity to make changes or modifications on the power system.  CECA has the only ROW easements for access to provide improvement to system upgrades.  <BR>a.

However, responsible interested parties may submit a proposal in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERAN AFFAIRS     PALO ALTO HEALTH CARE SYSTEM                 3801 MIRANDA AVENUE         PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA 94304JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following Justification and Approval, the proposed contract described below may be established through other than full and open competition pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C.  8127(c) as implemented by IL 049-07-08, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies Or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.1.	CONTRACTING AGENCY:  The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, Consolidated Contracting Agency is responsible for the contracting action as described herein and will enter into a contract that requires justification for other than full and open competition.  The solicitation number is VA-261-10-RP-0021.2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:  The request is being procured exclusive of competition, for a specific vendor, on a sole-source basis.  The award will be made to Intuitive Surgical, Inc., 1266 Kifer Rd., Sunnyvale, CA 94086, as a firm fixed price contract.  The projected period of performance is a basic year plus four option years. Intuitive Surgical designs and builds the da Vinci Surgical System.  It's a breakthrough platform for robotically assisted minimally invasive surgery and was purchased on a sole source basis from them for $1,430,000.00 in 2006.  At the time of purchase it was known that only Intuitive Surgical could provide the maintenance on this highly sophisticated piece of surgical equipment.  Intuitive Surgical does hold the proprietary information and is the only company that can provide the high level of maintenance required to keep the system working properly.  They have not authorized any other company to provide the maintenance and are therefore the only source capable of providing the maintenance.3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: This procurement is for maintenance of the surgical robot located at VA Palo Alto Health Care System.  The estimated price of the contract is $675,000.00.  4.	AUTHORITY CITED: This service is being procured pursuant to FAR 6.302-1. The preceding cited authority provides for purchase from a sole source whenever only one source is available and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  It should be noted that the intended awardee holds the proprietary information necessary to repair and maintain this equipment.5.	ANNOUNCEMENT OF REQUIREMENT: This solicitation will be advertised in Fedbizopps in case any interested firm has a query, however the intent will be to award to Intuitive, in accordance with #4 above.	6.     EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: A presolicitation notice detailing the intended 		        procurement was posted on Oct. 29, 2009, however no responses were received.  It should be 	  	        noted that a review of the VISN 22 Justification For Other Than Full And Open Competition 	  	        dated September 29, 2009, revealed that no responses  were received from a recent 10 day 	    	        Fedbizopps posting for the same requirement.7.	FAIR AND REASONABLE DETERMINATION: A Price Negotiation Memorandum will be prepared which will detail the actions taken by the Contracting Officer to ensure fair and reasonable pricing.JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONPage 2Subject: VA-261-10-RP-0021/VA Palo Alto Surgical Robot Maintenance8.	MARKET RESEARCH: GSA was queried however no results were returned in searching for surgical robot maintenance.  Intutive is not on the Federal Supply Schedule and there is currently no intention to establish any such contract, per conversation with Joelle Burg, Intuitive Contracts Dept.  See Item Numbers 2 and 6 above.9.	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COM PETITION: None.  See Item Numbers 2 and 6 above. 10.	INTERESTED SOURCES: There are no other sources that expressed an interest in the service.  Award to be made to Intuitive Surgical of Sunnyvale, CA.11.	AGENCY ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  VA Palo Alto Biomedical Engineering and Intuitive both confirm the life expectancy of the equipment will be beyond the five year period as contemplated by this RFP.  When the surgical robot has reached a point of obsolescence or is deemed to be at the end of its useful life, the VA will then research all available sources to determine what competitive means are available to fulfill its requirement.12.	CONTRACTING OFFICERS'S CERTIFICATION: I hereby determine that the facts and                                                                                     representations under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief._______________________                                   	         ______________________William L.
