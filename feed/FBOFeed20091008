<DESC><p>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) - The 672 ARSS intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Common Range Integrated Instrumentation System (CRIIS) Phase II effort on or about January 4, 2010. The objective of the CRIIS program is to provide enhanced TSPI accuracy and selected participant data bus information for test and training event participants, incorporating an advanced spectrally efficient data link. CRIIS is to be developed consistent with the overall goal of maximizing commonality among range instrumentation systems for test and evaluation and training applications. The Government anticipates the award on or about 1 August 2010 of a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee with Performance Incentives contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Fixed-Price-Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF) production lot options, and Time and Material (T&amp;M) options for Interim Contractor Support (ICS). If further risk reduction is deemed necessary, a technology maturation effort may be required prior to entering EMD for Increment 3.&nbsp; Proposals are due 30 days after RFP release. This competition is restricted to the two prime contractors who have participated in the 22-month Risk Reduction and Technology Maturation Phase (Phase I) of CRIIS. Schedule details for the various Increments can be viewed on the CRIIS schedule chart attached to this NOCA.<br />The Government intends to process a class Justification and Approval for this and subsequent related contracting actions to be awarded to the successful offeror. The Government also intends to award one or more additional contracts or modifications for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the fielded CRIIS system.<br />This proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a limited number of sources under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Responding firms must submit to the below contracting officer a statement of capability, to include the results of demonstration tests showing component maturity levels at TRL 6 or higher for all relevant technologies. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br />THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. This pre-solicitation notice neither constitutes a RFP nor an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does it restrict the Government in any way to an ultimate acquisition approach. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. All interested parties must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide this capability within 45 days of this publication date to be considered by the Government. Interested sources should contact the Points of Contact identified in this announcement. Collect calls will not be accepted.<br />The Air Armament Center has appointed an Ombudsman to hear concerns from potential offerors relating to this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather the Contracting Officer previously identified. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the Air Armament Center Ombudsman, Col Arnold W. Bunch, Jr., AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5495, (850) 882-5422.</p>

<p>There are two attachments in this RFI. Attachment I represents the Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the existing Cadet Administrative Management Information System (CAMIS) and MS Access databases at the US Air Force Academy. Attachment II represents future modernization efforts for CAMIS. Both requirements are currently being performed under one contract which will end 31 July 2009. The US Air Force Academy wishes to collect market researh information for the purpose of assessing market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms and conditions, timelines for adaptation and intergration, general cost information, and possible suppliers and sources.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPORSAL (RFP). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to collect Market Research Information and industry expertise for the purpose of gathering market research which may or may not be used to develop a Performance Work Statement (PWS), or Statement of Objectives (SOO). As stated earlier, the government considers information on market capabilities, common industry standards, latest technological advances, commercial terms and conditions, timelines for adaptation and intergration, and possible suppliers and sources to be helpful. All feedback and information received may be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a possible future acquisition. This notice is issued solely for market research and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. No award will be made from this RFI and the Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.</p>
<p>Responses</p>
<p>Contractors are encouraged to submit information on both attachments separately as the government considers these areas to require individual considerations. Contractors may provide information on only one attachment. This RFI is prepared for planning purposes only and is not restricted to small business. Sources are discouraged from submitting any information deemed competition-sensitive or proprietary. However, if sources elect to submit competition-sensitive or proprietary information, sources bear sole responsibility for marking said information as such to ensure appropriate safeguarding by the Government. The Government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>
<p>RFI responses on company letterhead are requested for submission electronically and in accordance with the instructions listed in each attachment. All questions and responses shall be submitted, via e-mail, to Christopher.Wilson@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p>After review of the responses to this RFI, if the Government plans to proceed with an acquisition, a solicitation will be published on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fedbizopps.gov). It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for a future synopsis/solicitation, as they will not be notified.</p>

Project background:  In late summer 2008, Hurricane Ike decimated a large portion of the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge along the Southeast Texas coast.  A previously existing bridge that originally crossed the East Bay Bayou was completely removed from the site during heavy flood and rain activity during the hurricane leaving only the oringal pilings and abutments following the storm.   Currently, visitors to the Refuge are not afforded access across the Bayou as in the past.  Remaining structure items consisting of pilings within the bayou that impede water flow during heavy rainfall and rising water levels are currently being removed by others.
Project Overview:  Specific requirements for this project shall be outlined within the statement of work within the solicitation documents and shall include, but is not limited to, design and construction of a pre-cast or cast-in-place free-span concrete bridge system including approach rails and abutments over the East Bay Bayou on the Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge.  Type of construction selected for the bridge system shall be based on the most economical type to accomplish the requirements outlined within the specifications.  Site work to remove existing bulkheads will be required prior to the installation of the new bridge system.  Photographs and drawings of the existing site will be provided upon the release of the full solicitation package.  Span of bridge is approximately ninety-six (96) feet.
In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.204, the magnitude of this project is between $250,000 and $500,000.  The North American Industry Classification Code for this Requirement is: 237990, Other Heavy Engineering and Civil Construction with a small business size standard of $33.5M.  The Product Service Code is: Y222, Construct Highways-Roads-Streets-Bridges.
This requirement is a 100% small business set-aside.

<DESC>USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) is announcing two projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  NRCS is seeking proposals for A&E Services under Contract Number AG-3A75-C-09-0021.  A Task Order will be issued to AMEC Earth & Environmental, Inc. for independent design reviews of two ARRA Watershed Rehabilitation projects in the state of Oklahoma: Upper Clear Boggy Creek Watershed, sites 33 and 34.  The NAICS Code for this Task Order is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 Million.  Design reviews with detailed cost proposals from AMEC Earth & Environmental are due no later than close of business on October 14, 2009.  Negotiation procedures will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 36.6.

The Contractor shall furnish the personnel, equipment, labor, materials, transportation, and facilities required to perform the services described below.

The Contractor shall perform an independent review as required by the policy of the USDANatural Resources Conservation Service as stated in the National Engineering Manual (NEM) Part 501.05(a), Part 520.26 and Part 511.05(b).  The NEM defines independent review as an examination and evaluation of procedures used and decisions made during the design of a dam by peers from outside NRCS or from an organizational unit other than the one responsible for the design. The NEM requires an independent review of designs for engineering job class VII and other projects, as determined, based on their complexity and potential hazard.  The Contractor shall assume responsibility, along with the designer, for the functional adequacy and structural soundness of the design, except in those instances where the contractors recommendations are not incorporated into the final design.  The Contractors capability must be equal to that needed to independently perform the design.

Independent reviews are made to ensure that design and construction procedures and decisions reflect safety considerations as well as economy. Dam safety considerations are directly related to the potential for loss of life, damage to valuable property, or disruption of transportation and utility facilities if the dam fails. The classification of dams is determined by the potential for such losses and damage (see NEM 520.2l). The Contractor shall determine whether the methods of analyses are appropriate and the assumptions are justified by the site conditions, as well as whether the results are reasonable.  The Contractor shall ensure that the design: 1) addresses all potential dam safety deficiencies, 2) safely and effectively meets the stated objectives, 3) addresses unique site conditions, 4) s consistent with industry practice for similar structures, and 5) Generally complies with, or has appropriate variances to, the more stringent of NRCS or applicable state policy and criteria.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 238220   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), for Facilities Management and Services Division (FMSD), in Washington, DC, intends to award a Purchase Order to EMCOR Government Services Inc, of Arlington, VA under the authority ofFederal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The purpose of this purchase order is to install and service a 12 ton condensing unit to serve four individual ductless evaporator units in the EPA studio area, as well as all of the peripheral work/equipment to be operational.  
The proposed equipment will require a service contract for regular maintenance and repairs. EMCOR currently holds a service contract with Facilities for all of Headquarters' supplemental A/C units including all computer rooms and special spaces. The new equipment must be added to the existing service contract. Facilities requires that EMCOR install the equipment in order to maintain warranties and provide seamless operation of the equipment. Also EMCOR's technicians have the required security clearance to EPA space. Adding another vendor would be a duplication of services. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 238220.    NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   It has been determined that EMCOR Government Services is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirement as they currently have the existing service contract for this type of equipment/service for EPA. To add this equipment to the service contract requires EMCOR to install the equipment in order to maintain warranties and provide seamless operation of the equipment. 
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement, as stated herein, may submit their corporate capabilities, which, if received by the response date of this announcement, may be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing and submitted to Rose Green, Contracting Officer, to green.rose@epa.gov.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The justification is as follows.  Recent court decisions have required that the EPA measure the thickness of pipe coating and construction debris layers some of which contain asbestos.  This thickness measurement is then required to be introduced in trials and hearings associated with criminal and civil cases.

<a href="mailto:plagge.david@epa.gov">DAVID H. PLAGGE</a>
<DESC>SYNOPSIS

The US EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) to procure subscriptions to the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC) under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 and FAR 6.302-5 in support of its responsibilities under HSPD-7 and Sections 1433 ? 1435 of the Safe Drinking Water Act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES. 
The resultant contract will consist of a twelve month base period and three (3) twelve month option periods.  The maximum potential for the base period is $3 million and is $2 million for each individual option period.  The WaterISAC is a one-of-a-kind, subscription based resource which serves as a clearinghouse for government and private information that helps the subscribers identify risks, prepare for emergencies and secure the nation's critical water infrastructure.  The WaterISAC provides users with sensitive threat information, emergency response tools, and the ability to network with the community of peers. Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are confidential venues for sharing security vulnerabilities and solutions within an industry.  The WaterISAC is a forum to keep drinking water and wastewater utility managers informed about potential risks to the nation's water infrastructure from contamination, terrorism and cyber threats.
 In addition, WaterISAC is used to help utilities respond to and recover from all hazards.  The WaterISAC links members through a secure online portal. The subscriber base includes water utilities and state and federal agencies dealing with security, law enforcement, intelligence, the environment and public health.  The WaterISAC, an ISAC for drinking water and wastewater systems, was created by AMWA in 2002.  AMWA?s WaterISAC is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirements because their service provides access to an exclusive community and network for water security information sharing and analysis through a secure portal. 
 Additionally, information sharing capabilities must be coordinated between an established, trusted group of utilities and stakeholders and administered by a trusted sector partner with an existing relationship and credibility with the water sector. Furthermore, Section 430 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 states that $2,000,000 is to be provided from the EPA?s ?Environmental Programs and Management? account to the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center/Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies.
THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability by responding to the office identified above. The capability statement should address the interested party?s capability to provide not only its clearinghouse capabilities, ability to access, analyze, and disseminate the necessary information, and its status as a trusted sector partner with an existing relationship and credibility with the water sector.  This documentation must be received by July 31, 2009 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 Interested parties should submit a written response to David Plagge by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to solicit a proposal from, and issue a contract to, Pitney Bowes Inc., of Baltimore, MD, for the purchase and onsite preventive and remedial maintenance of Pitney Bowes mail processing equipment and related hardware and software, including Pitney Bowes' proprietary Track and Trace software system enhancements, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>for a base year and four option years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Four of the five mail processing systems purchased under the contract will replace currently-installed Pitney Bowes mail processing systems at SSA's National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An additional Pitney Bowes mail processing system will be installed at SSA's Durham Support Center in Durham, NC as backup to the NCC mail operation.</p>
<p>The contract will procure and install Pitney Bowes MPS and FPS devices at SSA's NCC to replace existing Pitney Bowes mail inserter finishing equipment used by SSA to mail Social Security Number (SSN) cards and SSA notices to the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The current and replacement Pitney Bowes mailing systems include Pitney Bowes' proprietary Track &amp; Trace System, composed of hardware and software components.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two Pitney Bowes MPS inserters will replace the two currently-installed Pitney Bowes NCC Flowmaster inserters that SSA uses to provide SSN cards to the public, and two Pitney Bowes FPS inserters will replace SSA's two Pitney Bowes NCC Series 8 inserters that SSA uses to issue notices to the public. An additional MPS inserter will be installed at SSA's Durham Support Center in Durham, NC. and will serve as a backup and supplemental facility for SSA's NCC facility.</p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes MPS inserters will cut individual SSN cards from a 2,000 card bundle, obtain the security information for the Track &amp; Trace System, insert the cards into envelopes, apply postage and prepare sealed envelopes for pickup by SSA's presort contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The MPS systems will be functionally identical to SSA's existing upgraded Pitney Bowes Flowmasters (with only minor differences attributable to engineering changes made by Pitney Bowes) and will include Pitney Bowes proprietary Track and Trace hardware and software features for providing security measures necessary for controlling and accounting for new and replacement SSN cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes FPS devices will cut individual SSA notices from printed roll stock, obtain the security information for the Track &amp; Trace System, insert the notices into envelopes, apply postage and prepare sealed envelopes for pickup by SSA's presort contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The FPS inserters to be acquired will be functionally identical to SSA's existing upgraded Pitney Bowes Series 8 inserters (with only minor differences attributable to engineering changes made by Pitney Bowes) and will include Pitney Bowes proprietary Track and Trace hardware and software features for providing security measures necessary for controlling and accounting for SSA notices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The Pitney Bowes inserters will be tightly integrated with SSA's current Pitney Bowes Track and Trace System that Pitney Bowes has installed on SSA's current NCC Pitney Bowes systems and customized for SSA's use.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA implemented the Pitney Bowes Track &amp; Trace System to track and secure the public's sensitive personal information contained in SSA's daily mailings as well as SSA's issuance of new and replacement SSN cards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Salient characteristics of the proprietary Track and Trace system include: 1) "Real-Time" communication and "Real-Time" reconciliation with SSA electronic records. This is important because SSA needs to be able to capture and avoid issuance of duplicate SSN cards in "real time."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA must account for and provide the status of each SSN card immediately and not in a batch mode. 2) Physical integrity validation on the inserter. The Track and Trace System also includes a Pitney Bowes proprietary "Thickness Detection Kit" integrated into the inserter systems that can detect in "real time" the presence of multiple or duplicate SSN cards within a single envelope and prevent the issuance of multiple or duplicate cards.</p>
<p>Pitney Bowes will also provide maintenance under the contract for the equipment and software described above. The contractor will provide coverage from 12:00AM through 4PM Monday through Friday to service the Pitney Bowes equipment located in SSA's NCC in Baltimore, MD.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will provide onsite customer support engineers for the maintenance period described above (12:00AM through 4PM Monday through Friday) as well as on-call services outside the Principle Period of Maintenance (PPM) which includes weekends and holidays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor will provide similar coverage at SSA's Durham Support Center. The contractor will provide only Pitney Bowes-certified technicians to maintain the equipment during the service period. The contractor will perform regular preventive maintenance on the equipment in accordance with Pitney Bowes operating guidelines.</p>
<p>Other organizations that believe they are capable of meeting SSA's NCC Pitney Bowes equipment and software, and maintenance requirements are invited to submit information establishing a bona fide capability to fulfill the requirement. If the SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing this requirement, the agency will solicit a quotation and issue a sole source award for the supplying of inserter equipment and associated software, and on-site preventive and remedial NCC and Durham Pitney Bowes maintenance to Pitney Bowes under FAR Part 15, Contracting By Negotiation, and FAR Part 12, Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the information received. Responses to this notice must be submitted by October 16, 2009, 3:00 PM EST. Responses may be sent via e-mail only to the point of contact listed below.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Geological Survey (USGS), Pacific Islands Water Science Center, intends to make a non-competitive award to Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (HT) of Honolulu, Hawaii for technology that supports interisland connectivity using virtual LAN technology by establishing Ethernet connections to two additional Hawaiian office locations.  These locations include 360 Hoohana Street, Kahului, Maui, Hawaii and 4398 D Pua Loke Street, Lihue, Kauai, Hawaii.  USGS has the need to upgrade their existing HT network services from frame relay to Ethernet over MPLS at 3 Mbps data rates.  Since HT is the only Local Exchange Carrier (LEC), only they can provide this upgrade.  Once the upgrade has been completed, the USGS will require the enhanced IP Data Service (3 Mbps) at the two locations for one year, and the service at 360 Hoohana Street, Kahului, Maui, Hawaii will have the option of four years of service.
Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. is the only provider that can provide VPLS to all of the following locations and is the only provider that has the infrastructure and services all of the following USGS locations in Hawaii:  (1) 677 Ala Moana, Honolulu, (2) Hawaii Volcano Observatory, Volcano National Park, (3) Cell Site, Volcano National Park, (4) 2565 McCarthy Mall, Honolulu, (5) 590B Lipoa Parkway, Kihei, (6) 360 Hoohano Street, Kahului, and (7) 4398 D Pua Loke Street, Lihue.  Any other network service provider would have to utilize the Hawaiian Telcom existing infrastructure to provision similar services, which would result in overhead and higher costs.  Additionally, when two or more service providers are involved, issues often arise and can cause difficulty with problem resolution.     
The Request for Quotations (RFQ), number 10WRQQ0007, will be made available through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about 19 October 2009, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 5.102(a)(1) and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(i), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.  All responses must be in writing by email to the Contract Specialist at sklingler@usgs.gov.   
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-36, effective 10 September 2009.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information for Planning Purposes - The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to a requirement for Occupation Health Physician services for the Interagency Wild land Firefighter Medical Qualification Standards Program.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Quotation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to the RFI.  Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information they furnish must mark their responses accordingly to ensure proper handling.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the review.
SCOPE OF WORK Occupational Health Physician 
The purpose is to obtain professional services as needed to support the Interagency Medical Standards Program (IMSP).  Under 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 339 Medical Qualifications Determinations, medical standards may be established for functions with duties that are arduous or hazardous in nature.  The medical standards are required because of the arduous and hazardous occupational, functional and environmental requirements involved with wildland firefighting.  The medical standards are provided to aid the examining physician, the designated medical review officer(s), and officials of the involved agencies when determining whether medical conditions may hinder an individual's ability to safely and efficiently perform the requirements of a wildland firefighter without undue risk to themselves or others.  The medical standards are also intended to ensure consistency and uniformity in the medical evaluation of applicants and incumbents for this role. 
Each of the medical standards are subject to clinical interpretation by an appropriate medical review officer who will incorporate knowledge of the job requirements and environmental conditions in which employees must work.  Listed with the standards are examples of medical conditions and/or physical impairments that may be found to be disqualifying.  Individualized assessments shall be made on a case-by-case basis to determine the individual's ability to meet the performance-related requirements of the wildland firefighter function.  Final consideration and medical determination may require additional medical information and/or testing that is not routinely required during either the pre-placement or periodic medical examination process. 
The functional requirements for wildland firefighters are by nature arduous and hazardous.  These functions are performed under variable and unpredictable working conditions.  Due to the performance requirements and working conditions, the standards ensure the following: 
1. Wildland firefighters will be able to perform the full range of requirements of their duties under the conditions under which those duties must be performed. 
2. Existing/preexisting medical conditions of wildland firefighters and applicants will not be aggravated, accelerated, exacerbated, or permanently worsened. 
3. Demonstration of the interagency fire community's strong commitment to public and employee health and safety, and a strong commitment to maintaining the integrity of mission accomplishment. 
The standards and additional information on the IMSP can be reviewed at http://www.nifc.gov/medical_standards/resources/medstand_review-criteria.pdf. 
Services shall include: 
1) Independent Medical Evaluation (IME) - comprehensive review of the non-clearance medical issue which includes reviewing the previous years' interagency wildland firefighter medical examination(s), laboratory report(s), Further Evaluation request(s) for additional medical information by the nationwide medical provider's Medical Review Officer (MRO), firefighter's personal health care provider's response(s) to Further Evaluation request(s), and all submitted medical information to produce a report summarizing the medical implications of the non-clearance issue as it relates to the ability to safely and efficiently perform the full range of arduous duty tasks.  Regularly scheduled Interior Medical Review Board meetings are the second Tuesday of each month, at which time presentation of the case's medical pertinent information by the IME is required.  As required, the IME will be the subject matter expert for the interagency wildland fire community during litigation. 
2) Occupational medicine consultation - as requested by the IMSP or nationwide medical provider MRO, consultation on non-clearance medical concerns and the applicability to the medical standards or MRO medical clearance determination process.  Verbal and researched written responses are required. 
3) Medical Standards Team - occupational health medicine subject matter expert.  Travel (typically a 5 day trip with travel and per diem expenses reimbursed) as requested by the IMSP to observe firsthand the full range of duties involved in wildland firefighting.  Professional recommendation(s), verbal and in writing, to the IMSP regarding the application of current occupational medical practices to the interagency wildland firefighter medical standards (e.g. white paper on sleep apnea). 
It is estimated approximately 150 hours annually to fulfill the needs of this requirement. 
In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:
1. Business Information: Please provide the following business information for your company: Company Name; address; DUNS number; Point of Contact; Phone Number; E-mail Address; and Web Page URL. 2. Capabilities: Brief description of your company's capabilities and experience. 3. Applicable hourly rate.4. Provider(s) available within the Boise, Idaho area?

<DESC>RECOVERY- THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. 

RECOVERY - The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing position sensitive neutron detectors for use in the Very Small Angle Neutron Spectrometer (vSANS) at the NIST Center for Neutron Research. These position sensitive detectors are to be rectangular in geometry and arranged in panels which can be translated transverse to the direction of the incident neutron beam. The panels are then mounted on moveable carriages which can be translated along the direction of the incident neutron beam. NIST requires four long (100 cm  40 cm) panels to be mounted vertically and four short (50 cm  40 cm) panels to be mounted horizontally on the moving carriages. NIST also requires neutron event detection and position encoding `electronics as part of this procurement. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for position sensitive neutron detectors that can meet NISTs minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.
This contemplated procurement is anticipated to utilize Recovery Act Funding if it is determined that responsible sources can satisfy the requirement.
NIST has a need for a number of position sensitive neutron detectors that would meet the following requirements:
1.	Four long rectangular panels 100 cm high  40 cm wide  less than 31 cm deep
2.	Four short rectangular panels 40 cm high  50 cm wide  less than 31 cm deep
3.	The construction of the detector must be modular to permit removal and replacement of portions of the detector without major disassembly of the panel or associated electronics.
4.	In order to prevent parasitic scattering of neutrons and to permit panels to translate together to form a larger detection plane, the support structure of the panels must not extend laterally past the (shorter) edge of the detection region.
5.	The spatial resolution of each detector must be less than 8 mm  4 mm.
6.	The minimum neutron detection efficiency must be greater than 75% for 5  (35 meV) neutrons.
7.	The position encoding electronics must be mounted behind the detection plane and must operate in vacuum at pressures under 0.02 torr.
8.	The differential nonlinearity of the position encoding electronics must be less than 5% and the integral position nonlinearity must be less than 10%.
9.	The position encoding must not vary by more than 0.5 mm per day.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your companys size classification in any response to this notice.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The purpose of this task is to provide a mechanism for reimbursing definitive medical care provided to National Disaster Medical System (NDMS)-placed patients who were victims of declared disasters or public health emergencies in 2009.  Reimbursement, under the guidelines of the NDMS, will be made to hospitals (and licensed practitioners providing medical services to NDMS inpatients within those hospitals) that participate in the NDMS.</p>
<p>In summary, the contractor shall independently, and not as an agent of the government, furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the government, to develop and administer a claim-based reimbursement program for definitive medical care provided by qualified hospitals and licensed practitioners, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the <br />24 October 2005 NDMS Partners Memorandum of Agreement (to be provided).  The reimbursement program shall cover claims resulting from the activation of the NDMS</p>
<p>Interested small businesses are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Interested vendors must submit information regarding the respondents': (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training, specifically related to the requirement; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government and private contracts and references, and other related information that provides evidence of the respondent's capability and experience. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above and provide evidence that the vendor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice shall be limited to 20 pages, and must include:</p>
<p>(1) Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.</p>
<p>(2) Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.</p>
<p>(3) Business size for NAICS 813319 (size standard $7 million) and status, if qualified, as a small business. Businesses claming 8(a) or HUBZone qualifications must be certified by SBA. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages.</p>
<p>(4) DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR, at www.ccr.gov) to be considered as potential source.</p>
<p>(5) Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are requested as well.</p>
<p>Please submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3, above).</p>
<p>Teaming arrangements are acceptable, and the information required above on the company responding to this announcement, should be provided for each entity expected to be teammates of the respondent for performance of this work.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.</p>
<p>This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted because of this request. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this announcement.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice must be received by the Contract Specialist named below, by 3:00 PM Eastern Standard time on June 30, 2009, for consideration. Responses to this notice must be submitted via electronic mail (e-mail) to the Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses. However, information obtained as a result of this announcement may be reflected in the subsequent solicitation, and PSC may contact one or more respondents for clarifications and to enhance the Government's understanding. This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice.  The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District is issuing this notice to measure the interest and availability of large or small business concerns that are capable of designing, manufacturing, with on-site installation, two 130-ton intake gantry cranes.  One crane will be for Lower Monumental Dam, Kahlotus, WA, and one crane for Lower Granite Dam, Pomeroy, WA.  The following describes the cranes:<BR><BR>Lower Monumental Intake Crane:<BR><BR>A new 130-ton intake gantry crane shall be provided for Lower Monumental Lock and Dam.  The Contractor shall have experience primarily in designing and manufacturing new heavy duty, specialized cranes of this size and complexity, with on-site installation and load testing as secondary.    The new crane shall run on the existing rails on gantry trucks.  The gantry crane shall have a trolley with a main hoist and an outside actuating hoist.  The machinery shall have covers.  An operators cab and remote shall be provided to operate the crane.  The crane controls shall be a VFD system. The crane will have the latest technology for the communication, load indication and CCTV systems.  The primary power source for the crane shall be a diesel generator set, however a cable reel shall also be provided.  <BR><BR>Lower Granite Intake Crane:<BR><BR>A new 130-ton intake gantry crane shall be provided for Lower Granite Lock and Dam.  The Contractor shall have experience primarily in designing and manufacturing new heavy duty, specialized cranes of this size and complexity, with on-site installation and load testing as secondary.  The new crane shall run on the existing rails on gantry trucks.  The gantry crane shall have a trolley with a main hoist, an outside actuating hoist, and inside actuating hoists.  The machinery shall have covers.  An operators cab and remote shall be provided to operate the crane.  The crane controls shall be a VFD system.  The crane will have the latest technology for the communication, load indication and CCTV systems.  The primary power source for the crane shall be a cable reel, however a diesel generator set shall also be provided.  <BR><BR>No pre-engineered, kit or component based cranes will be allowed that are assembled from multiple sources. The crane will be a turn-key project from design to installation and manufactured from one responsible source normally in the business of providing crane design and manufacturing services similar to the size and complexity of this 130-ton crane.  Similar size and complexity is a gantry crane that provides approximately 178 feet of total lift and stands about 65 feet in height above the embedded rails, with operator control of crane motions accomplished by control switches located on the consoles of the operator's chair, pendant stations, and the radio transmitter.  The gantry structure will be integrated into the complete design package.  Anticipated life cycle is 40 years.<BR><BR>Both locations require load testing and acceptance along with the removal of the existing 100-ton gantry intake cranes.<BR><BR>Additional Information:<BR><BR>The NAICS code for this procurement is 333923 with a size standard of 500 personnel.  <BR><BR>Since there are two cranes needed at two different locations, bundling both requirements together may be an option if there is a benefit to the Government.  The first crane delivery would be approximately 12 months from award and the second crane would be approximately 18 months from award.  If there is no benefit to bundling, each crane will be solicited separately.  In order for us to determine if bundling would be a benefit to the Government, the interested contractor should answer the following questions when responding to the sources sought:<BR><BR>1.  By combining these two requirements, what would be the dollar or percentage of cost savings or price reduction? or list areas where there would be a cost savings?<BR><BR>2.  By combining these two requirements, would there be any quality improvements that would save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency?<BR><BR>3.  By combining these two requirements, would there be better terms and conditions or any other benefit of combining these two requirements?<BR><BR>4.  By combining these two requirements, will the aggregate dollar value of the anticipated award prevent you from submitting an offer?  If yes, provide an explanation.<BR><BR>5.  By combining these two requirements, will the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified prevent you from submitting an offer?  If yes, provide an explanation.  <BR><BR>6.  By combining these two requirements, will the geographical dispersion of the performance sites prevent you from submitting an offer?  If yes, provide an explanation.<BR><BR>Other pertinent questions we would like answered:<BR><BR>1.  Are these types of gantry cranes with a life cycle near 40 years customarily available, with the integrated design effort, in the commercial marketplace or for purchase commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) items with minor modifications?  <BR><BR>2.  Describe your firms established quality control program that includes the design, manufacturing and installation of new cranes.<BR><BR>3.  Does your company or team regularly design and manufacture new gantry cranes per CMAA 70 and ASME B30.2 standards?<BR><BR>4.  Provide three examples and the customers point of contact of cranes that your company or team has designed and manufactured that is at least 25-tons in capacity and similar in size and complexity to the 130-Ton Gantry Crane.

Similar size are lifting capacities equal or greater than 25-tons.  This resume shall include the contractors total number of years experience with designing and manufacturing gantry cranes with an estimated life cycle of 35-40 years,  and a description of three cranes designed and manufactured by the contractor that are considered as or more complex than the proposed 130-ton Intake Gantry Crane. If five past performance references are not available, please state that with the reason; <BR><BR>(4) answers to the two sets of questions (total of 10 questions) as stated above; <BR><BR>(5) and any other pertinent information you want to include. <BR><BR>The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed twenty (20) pages.  No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought or Government use of any information provided.

<DESC>Background
This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It does not constitute a commitment that the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will undertake a procurement action in this matter. The NCS is seeking comments regarding best practices for coordinating a national, multi-site, field study with distributed data collection of a common core protocol.  The NCS is interested in examining current approaches to optimize efficiency and effectiveness and is open to creative suggestions that depart from the existing model.  

The NCS is a longitudinal cohort study that will examine the effects of environmental influences on the health and development of approximately 100,000 children. Environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on childrens health and development.  Children will be followed from before birth until the age of 21 years.  The goal of the Study is to provide information that will ultimately lead to improvements in the health, development, and well being of children.  It is anticipated that Study participants will be enrolled from 105 distinct geographic areas across the country to form a nationally representative sample. 

The NCS Coordinating Center is tasked with providing support for the continued planning, development, and implementation of the NCS.  Critical Coordinating Center tasks include
 Development of all Study operations, including the Manual of Operations and Procedures (MOP), training materials, and data collection processes and forms;
 Technical training of NCS field staff in data collection protocols;
 Coordinating and assisting other NCS contractors (IT, local Study Centers) with implementing and supporting IT systems; sampling frame development; participant recruitment, enrollment, and retention; and conduct of data collection protocols;
 Management and oversight of data collection, including monitoring field work; sample and specimen collection, transport, and storage; reporting; and data editing and adjudication.  

Information Requested
The NCS is requesting feedback and suggestions on several topics.  For each, as appropriate, please describe any best practices, general levels of effort required, and anticipated problems or barriers.  

1. Identification, long-term follow up, and recruitment of eligible participants into longitudinal studies; 
2. Development, communication, and archival of materials, protocols and procedures related to field efforts;
3. Developing standardized training approaches that are effective and efficient within the parameters of a distributed data collection staffing model;
4. Monitoring and oversight of field efforts, including data receipt, management and reporting;
5. Establishment, operation and maintenance of a Data Center that connects over 100 field sites that provide direct management of data collection activities through web-based software systems, receives direct telephone deliveries of collected data from computer-based mobile devices, provides centralized study administration functions, conducts data editing of field questionnaire data and the results of laboratory processing of field samples, and prepares restricted and public datasets of study data.
6. Protection of field and derived data in accordance with the provisions of FISMA, HIPAA, and other relevant information privacy and security regulations throughout the collection, storage, processing, and access processes.
7. Process and procedures for the installation, update, and version control of COTS, GOTS, and custom study applications over a nationwide VPN installation that connects over 100 field sites.

How to Submit a Response
Please provide your response to this Request for Information (RFI) to Seena Mathews at mathewss@mail.nih.gov no later than 5pm(EST) on  Thursday, October 29, 2009.  Responses should be submitted as an email attachment in PDF format. Please limit responses to fifteen (15) pages or less.

SBA provides a number of financial assistance programs for small businesses including 7(a), 504 and disaster assistance loans. Within this section, we'll review eligibility requirements, SBA's loan programs, surety bonds and the role of SBA, equity capital topics, special purpose loans, SBA partner topics and 7(a) lender programs. Though the SBA does not provide grants to help you start a business, included is information on organizations and sites that can assist you in locating special purpose grants. Since June 15, lenders across the country have provided millions of dollars in capital to small businesses through the America's Recovery Capital (ARC)loan program. Created under the Recovery Act, the temporary ARC program offers interest-free loans to viable small businesses, which carry a 100 percent guaranty from the SBA to the lender and require no fees paid to SBA. Loan proceeds are provided over a six-month period and repayment of the ARC loan principal is deferred for 12 months after the last disbursement of the proceeds. Repayment can extend up to five years.<br />The ARC loan program is open to any SBA-approved lender. Non-SBA lenders can easily become SBA participants by working with their nearest SBA district office. Businesses interested in applying for an ARC loan should first contact their current lender. If you would like to speak directly to a customer service representative about the ARC Loan Program, please call our toll-free number (866-947-8081) Monday through Friday during the hours of 8am to 6pm (Eastern Time).</p>

<p>Scope: MCC must perform due diligence and requires thorough character vetting be done on all staff and directors of the responsible entity to ensure that individuals of high reputation are appointed.

<p>MCC requires 5 licenses for one base year and four (4) option years.</p>

<p>(b) Past performance shall be evaluated with respect to an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance on similar contract efforts.</p>
<p>(c) Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past and present performance.</p>

<DESC>This UNRESTRICTED Procurement IS FOR a Multiple Award Indefinite Quantity Contract for Engineering and Design Services for design Projects located throughout the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Area of Responsibility, Worldwide.  Projects will be in the primary area of the NAVFAC EURAFSWA AOR in Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia; however, Contract Task Orders may be placed for work on any DoD Activity worldwide. Up to three Indefinite Quantity Contracts will be awarded as a result of this competition.
The type of design projects expected to be performed under this contract include, but are not limited to:  Administration Buildings, Religious Facilities, Community Buildings, Dining Facilities, Recreational Facilities, Security Buildings, Child Development Centers, Bachelor Quarters, Navy Lodges, Airfield Facilities, Waterfront Facilities, Operational Facilities, Base Housing, Water Treatment Facilities and associated work, and Utility System upgrades.  
Architect-Engineering and Engineering Services that may be required under this contract include DD Form 1391 documentation, Design-Build RFPs, plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, surveying, soil borings, hazardous materials identification, energy computation, life safety code studies, interior space planning/design, other associated engineering services, shop drawing review, as-built drawing preparation, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), Commissioning, and construction inspection and engineering consultation services during construction.
The DD Form 1391 documentation is prepared in the Navy's Electronic Procurement Generator (EPG) and includes cost valuation surveying, concept sketches, site sketches with utility points of connections; and may require enhancement of previously prepared basic documentation, including economic analysis and recommendations for potential utilities impacts and sustainable features.  Firms are required to prepare cost estimates utilizing the SUCCESS estimating system in Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), specifications in the SPECSINTACT program, and drawings in AutoCAD format.  Firms will also be required to provide documents in PDF format.  Most projects require design in the metric system.  
As defined by paragraph 1-5 of UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities, this contract will require the services of a licensed fire protection engineer or consultant.  Also, in accordance with UFC 3-120-10, the services of a practicing, certified or registered interior designer will be required for this contract
The Government will reserve an option to negotiate Design-Build RFPs, final plans, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, all associated engineering services, and all post construction award services for all projects.  
The A&E must demonstrate his and each key consultant's qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation Factors (1) and (2) are considered most important and equal among themselves; factors (3) through (7) are slightly less important and equal between themselves; and factors (8) and (9) are of lesser importance and will be used as tiebreakers among technically equal firms.  Specific evaluation factors include:
(1)  Specialized Experience - The firm shall provide a maximum of six (6) projects that were completed within the past five years, or on-going projects that are substantially completed, that demonstrate specialized experience as noted below.  If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for each joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of six (6) projects.  Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330.  For submittal purposes, individual task orders issued on an IDIQ contract as well as separate, individual contracts are considered as individual projects.  The format for the projects shall include:  Experience as prime or consultant (please identify), point of contact name, e-mail address, phone number (failure to provide current accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified), contract number or project identification number, contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value and a list of team members who performed this work and a summary of the work performed.  Firms will be evaluated in terms of: 
?	Past experience of the firm and past working experience and relationship with key consultants with regard to design of similar types of facilities with an emphasis on DOD projects within the NAVFAC EURAFSWA AOR.
?	Experience with multi-phased design and construction programs.  Experience with designing facilities using the metric system of measurement as required by the NAVFAC Metrication Conversion Policy for Design, Planning and Design Criteria, and DOD/NAVFAC Guide Specifications.

?	Knowledge of local codes, laws, permits and construction materials and practices of the contract primarily in the NAVFAC EURAFSWA AOR



(2)  Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence of the Individual Design Team Members:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of: the professional qualifications and technical competence of the Individual Design Team Members participating in the six projects described in Evaluation Factor (1) and in terms of the competence and experience of the key personnel and technical team proposed to accomplish this work.  Key personnel are individuals who will have major contract or project management responsibilities and/or will provide unusual or unique expertise.
Firms/teams should include the following:?	List names of staff to be assigned to this contract.  Provide the following for each person:  professional registration (if applicable), role expected to play in this contract, and roles they played in the projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1 (if applicable).

?	Provide an organization chart of the firm and indicate the management plan for this contract and personnel roles in organization, in particular, management's approach/plan to engage and utilize in-country consultants to assure that design is compatible with in-country materials, standards and codes, and in-country construction practices.

(3)  Past Performance:  Firms will be evaluated in past performance with respect to work quality, compliance with schedules, and cost control (with emphasis on projects addressed in Evaluation Factor 1).  Firms should include any letters of commendation or awards.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other publicly available sources.  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  
(4)  Sustainable Design:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of their knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts through an integrated design approach and designing in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System.

Firms shall submit a detailed description of their internal quality control program and a list of their key responsible personnel and their qualifications.
(7)  Firm location  (provided that the application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract).  Firms will be evaluated on the locations of their office or offices that will be performing the work under this contract.  Due the worldwide coverage of this contract, offices in multiple locations would be considered an advantage.
(8)  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by DOD within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DOD A&E contracts among qualified A&E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts. Firms shall submit a detailed list including Title of Work, Contract Number, Task Order Number and total individual value of each Contract and Task Order and a subtotal of all work combined.
(9) Small Business Subcontracting Effort (ISRs and SF 330) Firms will be evaluated in terms of their extent to identify and commit to Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business (HUBZoneSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and if applicable, Historically Black Colleges or Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor. The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following: ?	Past performance in utilization of small business concerns.  All offerors shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, VOSB, SDVOSB and HBCU/MI.  Large Business offerors shall submit three "final" or "most recent" Individual Subcontracting Reports (ISRs) for similar contracts of relative size which show compliance with utilizing the various types of small business firms noted above. If subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  If Individual Subcontracting Reports were not applicable to the similar contracts noted, large business offerors shall submit other documentation which shows their  utilization of the various types of small business firms for the contracts. Small Business offerors shall also submit documentation which shows their utilization of the various types of small business firms for similar contracts of relative size.
?	Participation of small business concerns for this requirement.  Large businesses shall submit a draft Small Business Subcontracting Plan, in which they will be evaluated on the extent to which they identify and commit to the published Small Business Subcontracting Program.  The attached Small Business Subcontracting Plan template shall be used to complete the draft subcontracting plan.  Firms shall submit their "draft" Small Business Subcontracting Plans utilizing this template, and only this template.	The Secretary of the Navy has assigned the Naval Facilities Engineering 	Command goals for FY2010 in terms of percentages of total planned 	subcontracting dollars for utilization of small businesses.  Demonstrate the 	plan to meet these goals:  Small Business (SB) - 65.65%, HUBZone (HUB) - 	1.37%, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SBD) - 16.27%, Women-Owned Small 	Businesses 	(WOSB) - 14.68%, Veteran Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) - 3%, and 	Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) - 3%.  If a large 	business firm is selected for award, a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in 	accordance with FAR 19.6 and DFAR 219.7 will be required and incorporated 	into the contract award.
  ?	A draft Small Business Subcontracting Plan is not required from small business offerors; however, small business offerors shall submit similar information on the extent to which they identify and commit to subcontracting to large business (LB), SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, VOSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI if applicable in the performance of this contract.
The Small Business size standard classification is NAICS 541310, Architectural and Engineering Services, size standard $4,500,000.00.
The Government intends to award a maximum of three (3) contracts under this announcement.  Future task orders will be competed among the awarded contracts.  Each awardee will be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order issued under the multiple award contract, unless approval is obtained to waive or limit the competition in accordance with 16.505.  In order to determine the most highly qualified firm for each task order, the Government will evaluate each firm on the following criteria.  Evaluation factors (1) - (5) are of equal importance and factor (6) will be used as a tie-breaker only among equally qualified firms:
(1)	Experience with or knowledge of the specific facility and location addressed under the task order;(2)	Experience with or knowledge of the general geographical area of the project site;(3)	Professional qualifications and specialized experience relevant to the specific service required under the task order;(4)	Capacity to complete the work within the required timeframe.(5)	Past performance on previous task orders either completed or under way issued under the contract will also be considered once a history of performance is established.(6)	Equitable distribution of work:  Total dollar value of previous task order awards under this contract.  
The Government's evaluation will be based on (1) a review of the SF330 submitted by the form for the basic contract; and/or (2) the Government may request an addendum to the SF 330 addressing some or all of the above criteria for individual task orders.  In addition, should the Government choose to utilize other or additional criteria for the selection, the MAC holders will be notified prior to evaluation. 
All contractors are advised that registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database is required prior to award of a contract.  Failure to register in the DOD CCR Database may render your firm ineligible for award.  For more information, check the DOD CCR Website:  http://www.ccr.gov.  
The duration of the contracts will be for one (1) year from the date of an initial contract award with four (4) additional year option periods.  The guaranteed minimum for each MAC holder is established at $10,000 for the entire contract term (including option years).  The combined total amount that may be paid under the contracts (including option years) will not exceed $50,000,000.00 for the entire contract term (including option years).  The options may be exercised within the time frame specified in the resultant contract at the sole discretion of the Government subject to the workload and/or satisfaction of the A&E's performance under the subject contract.  There will be no dollar limit per task order and no dollar limit per year.  No other general notification to firms for other similar projects performed under this contract will by made.  Type of contract:  Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract.

In fiscal year (FY) 2008, FFP provided more than 2.6 million metric tons of food, valued at more than $2.6 billion, benefiting approximately 56 million people in 49 countries on four continents.  FFP supported emergency programs in 39 countries that help those affected by conflict and natural disasters such as drought or hurricanes, as well as long-term, non-emergency programs in 28 countries that seek to address the underlying causes of hunger, such as by increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening maternal and child health, and improving disaster preparedness. Some countries have both emergency and non-emergency programs.  Information on FFP is available at: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/humanitarian_assistance/ffp/

Core Duties and Responsibilities

The Surge Response Group (SRG) is a FFP program to satisfy its growing need for surge capacity.  In response to numerous emergencies worldwide, it became clear that FFP requires more staff to cover all needs in the field, as well as in Washington and to backfill for permanent staff deploying to the field.  FFPs SRG program will bring on board select candidates who could work on a temporary basis, for no more than 250 days per calendar year, and be deployed within one week to facilitate FFPs response to emergencies.  In some cases, they may be called upon to meet short-term needs to monitor non-emergency programs in the field.  SRG positions are contracted for an initial period of one year with the option to extend up to five years.  SRG FFP Officers will be considered part of FFP/Washingtons resources.  

SRG FFP Officers respond to humanitarian emergencies as required, worldwide, and may be deployed to the field as a FFP Officer alone, as part of a Disaster Assistance Response Team or to augment a regional office or Mission. She/he may also serve in Washington to perform Country Backstop Officer duties, provide backstop coverage for deploying Washington staff, or serve on a Response Management Team.
 
When in Washington, the SRG FFP Officer will work primarily  spending the majority of his/her time  on specific ongoing or Title II funded emergency programs.  The remainder of the SRG FFP Officers time may be spent on a variety of other Title II-related activities.

The full range of specific duties, some of which are in direct support of specific programs and some in support of general FFP office responsibilities, may include the following:

	Serve as primary point of contact for PVOs and WFP implementing Title II-funded programs, U.S. Government, and others on Title II food aid issues for the country assigned.

	Analyze and assess data from a variety of sources  including field assessments, technical data, early warning information, and reporting from USAID field staff, PVOs, and WFP  to recommend appropriate food assistance programs.

	Review appeals and proposals for emergency programs.

	Draft and assembles documentation for program approval and funding.

	Produce information products (e.g., updates, memoranda) on food security situations and FFP programs, provide briefings, and represent FFP in meetings and working groups with implementing agency staff, USAID colleagues and representatives from other agencies.

	Serve as FFP representative on Bureau Response Management Teams or other coordinating mechanisms.

When deployed to the field, activation will either be for emergency programs (in which case the SRG FFP Officer will work primarily on specific ongoing Title II emergency programs) or for non-emergency programs (in which case the FFP Officer will work primarily on program monitoring, assessments, and evaluations).  

Specific activities may include the following:

	Serve as point of contact for all issues pertaining to Title II food aid in the assigned country for the Mission, embassy, USAID/Washington, the regional FFP Office, other parts of the U.S. government, PVOs, international organizations, host nation governmental ministries and agencies, and others in the country.
	Monitor and report on implementation of ongoing Title II programs, including progress and problems encountered by grantees, as well as commodity management, including following up with cooperating sponsors on the status of loss claims.

	Provide information and guidance to Title II assistance award recipients on Title II regulations, policies and procedures.

	Report on all food security issues, to include changes in the food security situation and food aid requirements, government policies and actions affecting food aid programs, government food aid programs, and donor pledges and programs.

	Coordinate with the Country Team (consisting of the USAID Mission, U.S. Embassy, and/or other USG in-country staff), host government, PVOs, international organizations, donors, and others to address issues impacting Title II food aid.

	Undertake and report on assessments to inform Title II food aid funding decisions or modifications to ongoing programs.

	Work with PVOs on preparation of annual workplans and program modifications, and with WFP on new appeals or revisions to existing ones.

	Work with other parts of the U.S. government and other donors to promote integration of food aid with other programs to increase the effectiveness of the programs overall.

	Undertake other tasks, as assigned.

The basic duties and responsibilities do not change between the GS 13 and GS 14 levels.  An employee meeting the qualifications for GS 14 and hired at that level, however, is expected to exercise a higher level of autonomy and require less supervision.  
9.  SUPERVISION:  The incumbents will take direction from and report to the SRG Coordinator until activated, at which time she/he will be under the supervision of a FFP/Washington Division Chief or Team Leader, or a designated USAID staff member in the field.
 

10.  WORK ENVIRONMENT:  Work is primarily performed in an office setting.  The requirement for field trip assignments to consult with Mission and cooperating sponsor managers of food aid programs may however expose the incumbent to difficult working surroundings and security risks during the course of travel.

11.  START DATE:  Immediately, once necessary clearances are obtained.

12.  POINT OF CONTACT:  See Cover Letter.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal Services Contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can</pre>
<pre>be:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>an existing published wage determination</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a survey underlying a wage determination</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a wage determination matter</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests</pre>
<pre>for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour</pre>
<pre>Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted</pre>
<pre>because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the</pre>
<pre>Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial</pre>
<pre>contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)</pre>
<pre>and 3.) should be followed.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal</pre>
<pre>process described here, initial contact should be with the</pre>
<pre>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Write to:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wage and Hour Division</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Department of Labor</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Washington, DC 20210</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an</pre>
<pre>interested party (those affected by the action) can request</pre>
<pre>review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator</pre>
<pre>(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wage and Hour Administrator</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Department of Labor</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Washington, DC 20210</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the</pre>
<pre>interested party's position and by any information (wage</pre>
<pre>payment data, project description, area practice material,</pre>
<pre>etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an</pre>
<pre>interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative</pre>
<pre>Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Write to:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administrative Review Board</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Department of Labor</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Washington, DC 20210</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can</pre>
<pre>be:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>an existing published wage determination</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a survey underlying a wage determination</pre>

<pre><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a wage determination matter</pre>
<pre>*<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests</pre>
<pre>for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour</pre>
<pre>Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted</pre>
<pre>because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the</pre>
<pre>Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial</pre>
<pre>contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)</pre>
<pre>and 3.) should be followed.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal</pre>
<pre>process described here, initial contact should be with the</pre>
<pre>Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Write to:</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an</pre>
<pre>interested party (those affected by the action) can request</pre>
<pre>review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator</pre>
<pre>(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wage and Hour Administrator</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Department of Labor</pre>

<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Washington, DC 20210</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the</pre>
<pre>interested party's position and by any information (wage</pre>
<pre>payment data, project description, area practice material,</pre>
<pre>etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre>3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an</pre>
<pre>interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative</pre>
<pre>Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Write to:</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administrative Review Board</pre>
<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Department of Labor</pre>

<pre><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Washington, DC 20210</pre>

<DESC><p>Air Education and Training Command Specialized Contracting Squadron Strategic Sourcing Flight (AETC CONS/LGCS), Randolph AFB, TX is conducting an acquisition for Integrated Solid Waste Management (ISWM) services at 12 AETC Bases and Fort Sam Houston (FSH). This pre-solicitation synopsis is being issued for non-personal services. Note: The description contained within this synopsis is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all inclusive. AETC intends to combine refuse and recycling services incorporating a Resource Management (RM) approach and consolidate 12 AETC bases plus Ft Sam Houston (FSH) through strategic sourcing. The RM approach is a dual vectored approach aimed at analyzing waste streams currently generated by installations. One avenue seeks out methods and innovation to grossly increase diversion. A second analysis determines the most cost effective commodities to process at the specified installation based on existing Government Furnished Equipment/Property (GFE/GFP) and commodity market strengths. Both streams are baselined to determine actual diversion metrics. Diversion of solid waste is focused upon obtaining the new diversion goals while maximizing the amount of revenue generating commodities being diverted to the recycling operations. Innovative methods are recommended and implemented throughout the process to increase solid waste separation and disposal, as well as innovative use of refuse/recycling container placement and scheduling/routing to minimize non-value added tasks in the process as well as increasing the installation's participation in the program. Successful offerors will be responsible for all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervision and other items and services necessary to perform refuse and recycling services through a RM approach. The RM approach can be utilized within both the refuse and recycling functions separately. The contractor shall perform to the standards in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) to include all applicable local, state and federal regulations. We anticipate a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to up to five (5) awardees will result from the solicitation. We foresee the basic MATOC to be for a one (1) year base period and will include 7 one-year option periods. Each base will receive a separate task order and shall be for a one (1) year base period and will include 4 one-year option periods. We intend to issue task orders for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler upon award of the MATOCs. We anticipate three (3) additional task order competitions over the next three years to phase in the additional 10 bases. There will be a 30-day mobilization period for Goodfellow, Sheppard and Keesler AFB. A 30-day mobilization period will be utilized prior to implementing each additional task order. Solicitation, amendments and other miscellaneous documents will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website and no hard copies will be mailed. It is the responsibility of each offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates or changes to current information. This requirement will be conducted utilizing the Small Business 8(a) competitive procedures and will be evaluated using a Performance Price Trade-off approach per Informational Guidance (IG) 5315.101-1. All responsible 8(a) firms may submit a proposal which shall be considered. A source selection will be conducted per Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315 and Mandatory Procedures 5315.3 at AETC CONS/LGCS, Randolph AFB TX.

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) Governors has a requirement, subject to the availability of funding, that it intends to negotiate and award as a non-competitive commercial item contract to the Philippines Communications Satellite Corporation (PhilComstat), 11th Floor, 316 Senator Gil Puyat Avenue 1200, Makati City, Metro Manila, Philippines. The contract will include a base period (January 1 - December 31, 2010) with six one-year option periods, subject to the availability of funding. Under the contract, BBG will lease from PhilComstat the necessary telecommunications infrastructure including but not limited to satellite space segment, microwave links and fiber optic cable to support BBG distribution requirements in the region through and between existing and any future planned BBG transmitting stations facilities located in the Philippines. This contract with PhilComstat will avoid any interruption in the Agency's services that are considered mission critical, as there can be no break in the existing services. This sole source procurement is being done in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1)(i), 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), which permits other than full and open competition "when there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source." PhilComstat is the only recognized entity in the Philippines having jurisdiction and control over all telecommunications activities. To own, operate and maintain satellite transmission systems in the Philippines, PhilComstat must approve the facilities and allow access to the various satellite service provider space segment resources. Interested firms must submit adequate documentation of their capability to respond to this requirement in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting date of this notice. All documentation submitted by interested firms shall be sufficient in depth and detail to allow for an evaluation without the need for added information. A final determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement will be based upon the response to this Public Notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Those who are interested are cautioned that oral or incomplete submissions will not be accepted. All inquiries concerning this matter shall be submitted in writing to the point of contact, Myria Carpenter, who can be reached via E-mail at mecarpen@bbg.gov. This public notice is not an RFP, RFQ or IFB. No set-aside used.

<DESC><p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ADD THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>The proposed work reflects a continuation of a project that was initiated by NIST during summer 2009 in which researchers from Ohio University assisted NIST with the data collection and developed data processing algorithms specifically related to a funded NIST project on public-safety communications. It would not be cost effective for NIST to contract with another organization to develop new data processing algorithms at this time since this is the final phase. It is efficient in the data processing to have personnel that have knowledge in the data collection, such that they are familiar with the data collecting procedures and understand how the data was acquired and the environment the data was collected.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>
<p>GSA IS HEREBY REQUESTING PHASE ONE PROPOSALS. This Phase One Solicitation provides Offerors with instructions regarding the submission of their complete Proposals and the evaluation thereof. Utilizing the format prescribed within, Offerors are to provide the requested information and demonstrate their qualifications. Responses shall be as complete and accurate as possible and present data relative to the specific Project under consideration. Offerors shall make every effort to present information clearly and concisely in accordance with the formats described herein.</p>
<p>A. PHASE ONE - REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS (RFQ)</p>

<DESC>Amendment 2: Additional Questions and Answers on Pre-Solicitation Notice<BR><BR>Q5.  Given the size and importance of this contract, will the government please consider extending the due date by as much as 14 days to allow our JV teaming arrangements and FCL to be finalized and provide ample time for preparation of a very detailed and comprehensive SF330?<BR><BR>A5.  There will be no extension to the due date at this time.<BR><BR>Q6.   Given the size and security clearance requirements of this contract , the Small Business participation goals (70% of all subcontracted dollars) may be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to achieve unless the selected firm (or JV team) can self-perform the vast majority of the contract requirements.     Will the government consider reducing the small business goal to about 40%(+/-)?   <BR><BR>A6.   No.  However, contractors may propose other goals.  See FAR 19.705-4.<BR><BR>Q7. We would like to request permission to use a reduced font for the tables, figures, graphics, etc., such as 8-9 point font, and keep the narrative text to 12 point font.<BR><BR>A7. As listed in Paragraph 4 of the synopsis, font size shall not be smaller than 12 fonts.<BR><BR>Q8. We do not have a facility clearance or any cleared personnel.  We have not had a project that required clearances up to the point or a sponsoring agency for a clearance.  Does this prevent us from being part of team pursuing this solicitation based on paragraph 3(a), which is requiring a Top Secret Clearance for the Cost Estimator?  Can a clearance be obtained once the project is awarded?<BR><BR>A8. As referenced in Amendment 1, requirements and selection criteria regarding personnel and facility clearances are identified in paragraph 3(a) in the synopsis. Information regarding obtaining facility and personnel security clearances can be found at the Defense Security Services website: www.dss.mil
