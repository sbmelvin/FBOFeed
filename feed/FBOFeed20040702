<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award a contract on a sole source based to the Advertising Council Inc., 1203 19th Street, NW, 4th Floor, Washington, DC  20036, for the development and implementation of two national public health education campaigns: the National Anti-Stigma Campaign and the National underage Drinking Public Service Campaign. The statutory authority is 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302 1(a)(2)(ii); only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NATIONAL ANTI-STIGMA CAMPAIGN:  The Contractor will develop and implement a national public education campaign, entitled the National Anti-Stigma Campaign, to reduce stigma associated with mental illnesses and encourage help-seeking behavior across the age span.  This requirement is in accordance with the conference agreement (H. Report 108-401) of the United States Congress for the Consolidated Appropriations Bill (P.L. 108-199) that authorizes “a nationwide, three-year public service campaign to reduce the stigma of mental illness. The conferees expect SAMHSA to work in partnership with a private, non-profit agency that is the leading producer of public service advertisements (PSAs) and is able to use the services of volunteer advertising agencies and donated media.”  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source because of its unique capability and capacity as a leading producer of PSA's and ability to use the services of volunteer advertising agencies and donated advertising media space and time.  No other organization is able to provide these required elements as specifically requested.  As a result, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant reduction in desired effectiveness of the Campaign resulting in an unacceptable probability of failure, and resultant costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The purpose of this contract is to initiate a national public education campaign in concurrence with the recommendations of the President’s New Freedom Commission on Mental Health and the United States Congress that improves the general understanding of mental illnesses, promotes recovery, and encourages help-seeking behaviors across the age span.  The campaign will target educational efforts to the general public and specific sectors of America’s population, e.g., older adults, racial and ethnic minorities and rural communities; make clear that recovery is possible; identify and promulgate research-based public heath messages and activities; and support local efforts to reduce stigma.  A public-private sector workgroup that includes representatives of private and public sector groups with experience in developing effective public health education campaigns will advise the process and participate in a mutually acceptable, comprehensive campaign over 3 years.  The NASC will include 1) the development of the Campaign Workgroup; 2) a Campaign Kickoff meeting, press conference, and legislative briefings for policymakers; 3) establishing collaborative relationships with ongoing CMHS anti-stigma campaigns specifically including the ADS Center and the EBI; 4) production of a Community Partnership Kit; 5) research and planning; 6) development of a strategic marketing plan; 7) creative development, production, and distribution of multi-media materials that include TV, radio, and print PSAs and related communications materials; 8) regional local community partnership meetings; 9) and tracking and evaluation activities.   The estimated period of performance is 36 months.  National Underage Drinking Public Service Campaign:    This campaign seeks to prevent or delay the onset of underage drinking by directing public service messages at parents.  It will target the parents of 11 to 15 year olds. It will identify and promulgate research-based public health messages and activities; and support national and local media efforts to reduce underage drinking.  A public-private sector workgroup that includes representatives from he industry and advocacy organizations working in the prevention of underage drinking will advise the process and participate in a mutually acceptable comprehensive campaign over one year and two option years.  Accordingly, it is the intent of SAMHSA to award a cost-reimbursement type contract for a period of one base year, plus two 12 month option periods to each of these organizations for the respective tasks above.  The estimated issue date of the Requests for Proposals (RFP's) is July 16, 2004, with the responses due 30 days later.  This synopsis of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties may submit Capability Statements.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to: Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Office of Program Services, Division of Contracts Management, 5600 Fishers Lane, Parklawn Building, Room 13C-06, Rockville,  MD 20857, Attn:  Mary Ann Deal; or by facsimile to (301) 443-0019.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted. Capability Statements must be received in writing, by no later than July 9,  2004, 3:00 PM, local time.

<SOLNBR>33938
<RESPDATE>072104
<ARCHDATE>07022005
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  The MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE solicits CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS for the study entitled "LITERATURE REVIEW, SYNTHESIS, AND DESIGN OF MONITORING OF AMBIENT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT INTENSITY ON THE ARCTIC OCS REGARDING POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON RESIDENT MARINE FAUNA" for the Alaska Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Region.  THIS ACQUISITION IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.  The NAICS code is 541690 and the small business standard is $6,000,000.00.  The contractor must be capable of performing all of the tasks described below.  BACKGROUND:  In the Final Proposed Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2002-2007, (July 2002), the MMS proposes lease sales in the Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea/Hope Basin, Norton Basin, and Cook Inlet Planning Areas.  Stipulation No. 8 of the MMS Final Beaufort Sea Multiple Sale EIS (February 2003) requires that all structures associated with offshore drilling must be lighted in order to avoid avian mortality.  Substantial development in the Arctic involving the deployment of artificial light sources has already occurred adjacent to and in the Beaufort Sea.  Industrial support facilities, such as the buildings and storage areas at West Dock, structures at Endicott Spur Drilling Island, structures and work areas on Northstar Island, and support vessels and supporting facilities are already brightly lighted.  More lighted structures can be expected as OCS development proceeds.  Light radiating outward from structures is a potential factor affecting the marine environment.  Little study has been made of the introduction of artificial light into the formerly dark fall and winter Arctic habitats of numerous species of marine invertebrates, fish, water birds, and mammals.  These include a number of protected species that live in, or migrate through, potentially artificially lighted habitat during dark periods and seasons.  At a recent interagency coordination meeting, the issue of potential conflict between lighting strategies and other non-avian marine life was raised.  The proposed study will address the issue of artificial light in the dark Arctic by conducting a literature review and design a potential artificial light monitoring program.  The study will lay groundwork for future monitoring of ecological effects of increased artificial lighting at several trophic levels.  Information generated from this proposed literature review and synthesis will be used by MMS in a variety of NEPA assessments and/or other environmental considerations. It will support planning for and decisions about artificial light in the Arctic.  The proposed monitoring program suggested by this project will help shape future recommendations in this area.  THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN TASKS:  Task 1 - Literature Review and Synthesis (a) Conduct a comprehensive literature review and synthesis of the available information on potential artificial lighting effects on arctic marine species commonly found in Alaska OCS lease areas, including species which are important trophic components, protected species, or endangered species in the Beaufort Sea Area.  Emphasis will be devoted toward potential effects during normally dark periods or seasons in the Alaska arctic marine environment.  A review of the physics of light transmission and reflectance, methods of measurement, and applicable modeling will be included and summarized.  Potential sources of information include, but are not limited to: primary scientific literature and books from national and international sources; unpublished reports, analyses, and other accessible documents; other sources such as internet homepages and accessible data bases.  The contractor is requested to also contact appropriate sources at the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, the Alaska Resources Library and Information Services, and/or other knowledgeable sources to identify local information on responses of sensitive species to light, and prepare related annotated bibliographic information.  (b) For this task, draft and final narrative reports of the review and synthesis of information, methods used, major information sources, contacts with information sources, and any problems encountered will be prepared.  The report will summarize/list any expected but currently unavailable pertinent reports, journal articles, or other in-press material of which the MMS Alaska OCS Region should be aware and of which the contractor has learned as part of the search.  The report will explain any special background, features, classifications within, considerations, or limitations of the annotated bibliography prepared.  A final synthesis report and bibliography will be required.  The bibliography will be annotated and in a ProCite or ProCite-compatible format.  Task 2 - Hold a technical meeting:  Hold a one-day technical meeting at MMS Alaska office (Anchorage, Alaska) to consider information needs based on the literature search and to identify important areas where there is limited or no information, to discuss alternative approaches and sampling strategies, and to make recommendations on the potential design of an artificial ambient light monitoring program for existing Arctic OCS development areas.  The principal investigator shall make presentations, answer questions, and discuss options with representatives of the MMS, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and other invited parties. For this meeting, the principal investigator shall present the results of the literature review (Task 1) and shall present a preliminary design for an artificial ambient light-monitoring program which could be potentially applied in existing OCS development areas.  The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTANT CONTRACT WILL BE EIGHTEEN (18) MONTHS WITH AN ESTIMATED COST RANGE OF $130,000 TO $150,000.  HOW TO RESPOND: In order to compete for this contract, an offeror must demonstrate they are qualified to perform the work by providing a CAPABILITIES STATEMENT, describing in detail: (A) The scientific personnel who would be responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information; (B) The organization's expertise with this type of work and a description of your facilities and resources; and (C) Specific references (including project identifier and description, period of performance, dollar amount, and client name and phone number) for previous work of this nature that your organization or personnel are currently performing or have completed within the last three (3) years.  ALL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SHOULD BE MARKED AS SUCH.  RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 P.M., EASTERN TIME, JULY 21, 2004.  OFFERORS SHALL SUBMIT their Capabilities Statement, in ORIGINAL and TWO (2) copies, to Michael W.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c)	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC POL #215 '737 7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].

	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                                                         ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to shcedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be defereed pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>NA The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) plans to procure on a non-competitive basis with the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics – Age Lab, Cambridge, MA, to assist in the development of Improved Display Interfaces for railroad operations. The Railroad Traffic Planner application, which was developed by MIT with the Volpe Center, has been designed to assist railroad planners who have little time and limited monetary resources available for creating and modifying train schedules. Previous work on this task focused on identifying and incorporating the functions necessary for a traffic planner to plan schedules, address track outages and scheduled maintenance as well as unscheduled events. The first prototype focused on passenger operations where train movement s are tightly scheduled. A second prototype was adapted for freight operations, which are more loosely scheduled. A version integrating features from both operations, which are more loosely scheduled. A version integrating features from both was then created, so that traffic planners from both types of railroads can make optimal use of the tool.  Another goal has been to distribute the Railroad Traffic Planner to additional railroads to evaluate its effectiveness in more settings.  The contractor will be required to support the Federal Railroad Administration in implementing the system at two railroad cites. The contractor will also be required to provide “help desk” support to resolve issues identified by the railroads.  This procurement will be conducted under Simplified Acquisition proc edures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  Small business firms classified under NAICS Code 541990, Business Size Standard $6M, that are interested in proposing on this requirement must respond in writing no later than 15 days from the date of this publication that they have a detailed and comprehensive knowledge of the demonstration prototype software used for improved display interfaces for railroad operations.  The contractor must possess the rights to the Railroad Traffic Planner application software previously developed by MIT.  This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority in FAR Part 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  A determination by the Government not to compete  this proposed purchase order based upon responses received to this notice would normally be considered, solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The RFQ issuance will be on or about July 15, 2004.  Small business firms will be required to submit a maximum of three but not less than two pages of documentation in support of the above for evaluation prior to receiving a solicitation. No telephone requests will be accepted – only written requests for this solicitation will be accepted, however, we will accept requests via facsimile at (617) 494-3024, ATTN: Karen Marino, DTS-853.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Services Center (Center) is seeking qualified A-E firms that have the operational capability to use remote sensing technologies, in the coastal zone, to produce high spatial resolution land cover products.  The contractors shall detail and demonstrate a methodology that will successfully introduce high spatial resolution data and land cover products into the current Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) effort.  Methodologies and procedures derived from this solicitation may be, in whole or part, the basis for future, high resolution C-CAP mapping, and possible incorporation into future National Land Cover Database (NLCD) mapping efforts.  For this reason, the proposed approach must have the flexibility to accommodate multiple users, be nationally consistent, intuitive, repeatable, and as extensible as possible.  Methodologies that are not specific to, or dependent upon, one data source and which do not utilize overly burdensome proprietary algorithms are preferred. The purpose of this pilot is to determine the current operational commercial capability to use remote sensing to produce a high spatial resolution coastal land cover product, in an operational manner, which is consistent with the vision of C-CAP as a source of current, highly accurate, highly useful information in the coastal zone.  The resulting land cover, and the methodology used to derive this land cover, should relate to and build upon the information contained within the moderate resolution C-CAP baseline product, but provide additional land cover data at a spatial scale more appropriate for state and local resource managers to use in support of increasingly detailed, site specific, management decisions. The outcome of this pilot will be a methodology and the demonstration of that methodology, through the production of a high spatial resolution C-CAP land cover product.  C-CAP requires that the final land cover(s) adhere as closely as possible to the standards of consistency and accuracy as specified in this solicitation, or described in the accepted proposal. The result of this effort will be compared to field observations, collected by NOAA personnel. NOAA may share the results of this demonstration with our partners and present these results at conferences and workshops.  Work shall be performed within a quality system that complies with ANSI/ISO/ASQC Q9002-1994 or better and deliverables shall meet quality standards based upon defined formal and informal specifications and standards.  The services will be procured in accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks A-E Act) and FAR 36.  The NAICS code is 541370.  This procurement is unrestricted.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  Depending on the availability of funds, NOAA intends to award up to 3 contracts for between $25,000 and $50,000 each for the mapping services (not including the cost of the source data).  REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor(s) shall provide high resolution land cover data for an area to be designated at a later date within the Florida panhandle. Data collection, processing, and delivery shall be accomplished in accordance with the following specifications.  The Contractor shall provide all necessary labor, equipment, material, software, and supplies to satisfactorily complete the requirements of this solicitation. 1) The Contractor shall describe the source data and sensors that will be used for the project.  2) The Contractor shall describe the methodology for detailing C-CAP land cover categories from the raw data and the accuracy with which they can be estimated.  Method procedures, techniques and algorithms used must be documented and validated. 3) The horizontal resolution of the source data shall be no greater than fifteen meters, with a horizontal accuracy of 10 meters or less. 4) The final product that is delivered shall include the intermediate data sets used as input to any algorithms used, the derived products, and FGDC-compliant metadata. 5) Delivered land cover data and metadata shall become the property of NOAA and will be shared with the public. 6) Delivery media shall be CD or DVD.  If the Contractor believes other delivery formats and/or mechanisms would serve NOAA’s needs in a more efficient manner, the Contractor is encouraged to propose alternatives.  Land cover data produced under the terms of this solicitation shall be as taxonomically correct and consistent with the revised C-CAP Coastal Land Cover Classification System Definitions as possible. See our web site at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/crs/lca/ccap.html for more details on the C-CAP classification scheme.  The land cover classes to be identified and mapped under the terms of this solicitation are identified in Table 1 below.  These standard C-CAP classes are proposed as a starting point, for the high resolution classification system, with the realization that some of these categories may not be feasibly mapped (i.e. low, moderate and high density developed may be more accurately mapped in one impervious class; mixed forest may be more accurately captured within the evergreen or deciduous categories; etc.).

Table 1. C-CAP Land Cover Classification System.

The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP): Guidance for Regional Implementation, which summarizes the original C-CAP methods and procedures, shall be utilized only as an additional reference, but it should be noted that our website reflects the recent changes to the class schemes and methodologies which have been incorporated as a result of closer collaboration with the USGS.  The contractor is required to identify those classes, in Table 1, which can feasibly be mapped to the standard C-CAP individual class accuracy of 80% (overall classification accuracy of 85% or better), which classes fall below that standard, and which classes should not be targeted. Additionally, the contractor shall propose a more detailed classification system.  This classification system shall build upon the standard class scheme identified in Table 1.  Proposed classes may include additional coastal land cover or land use categories, and/or categories specific to only certain geographies, but shall exist as subclasses to those classes listed in Table 1.  In other words, the contractor shall provide two different land cover schemes in response to this solicitation, first those classes in Table 1 that can be mapped using their proposed methodology and a second, more detailed, site specific, land cover scheme which are subset from, and can be folded up into, that standard.  The contractor shall identify what additional classes can be mapped, detail the methodology of how those classes will be extracted, and what accuracy is reasonable for the extraction. The result of this effort may be compared to field observations, collected by NOAA personnel or additional information, in order to assess the success of the proposed methodology in more subjective terms than the analysis above.  Any ancillary information or operation that improves accuracy and enhances data quality in the generation of land cover and change data is encouraged. The baseline C-CAP data and ancillary data sets for the designated area may be available for use on this project. However, pre-existing land cover data shall not be substituted for spectrally defined clusters or model-based decisions (i.e., “burning-in” ancillary data such as National Wetland Inventory (NWI) polygons for wetland categories is not acceptable).  The Contractor shall document all delivered data and data products according to Executive Order 12906.  Specifically, the Contractor shall deliver for all data and data products, metadata records which detail all flight lines, flight dates and times, datum, reprojections, resampling algorithms, processing steps, field records, and any other pertinent information.  The metadata records shall conform to the Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata (FGDC-STD-001-1998) as published on May 1, 2000, by the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) or to any format that supersedes it as determined by the FGDC.  Profiles and extensions to the standards that have been endorsed by the FGDC shall be used if they are applicable to the data or data products.  The metadata records shall contain any and all elements applicable to the data or data product.  The metadata record shall contain sufficient detail to ensure the data or data product can be fully understood for future use and for posterity.  The metadata records shall be delivered free of errors in both content and format as determined by the metadata parser (mp) program developed by the United States Geological Survey or an equivalent.  The Contractor shall complete and provide the following minimum deliverables for the geographic area to be specified later. 1) High resolution image data, if provided by the contractor.  2) Land use / land cover data, including intermediate data sets used as input into the final algorithm and final data products to include the C-CAP standard classes that could be mapped and the refined, more detailed classes, that roll up into the C-CAP standard classes. 3) FGDC-compliant metadata for all data sets 4) Final report describing the final methodology, class systems, achieved results, lessons learned, suggestions for how to perform change detection as an aid in determining geographies of interest for future high resolution image data (as wall to wall image acquisition may not be feasible), how to incorporate the final high resolution land use / land cover produced into the existing C-CAP moderate resolution baseline, and a cost analysis for implementing methods operationally on a national level in the future.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria, listed in descending order of importance are provided below.  See Note 24 for the general selection process.  1.

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<CONTACT>Hugh Harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), intends on issuing an award under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Independent Maritime Assessment Associates, Ltd. (IMAA) for design studies. Independent Maritime Assessment Associates, Ltd. (IMAA), the originator of the Partial Air-Cushion Supported Catamaran (PACSCAT) concept, is being contracted to perform conceptual design studies for a Causeway Ferry system using PACSCAT technology. Concepts shall be developed to suit the mission requirements of the U.S. Navy’s INLS. Concepts shall be developed to apply PACSCAT technology to this system to achieve higher transit speeds. The concepts shall be developed in a way that allows the PACSCAT modules to be applied sequentially (starting with the BM and going aft) in combination with the existing modules. Independent Maritime Assessment Associates, Ltd. (IMAA), the or iginator of the Partial Air-Cushion Supported Catamaran (PACSCAT) concept, has developed a technology that possesses characteristics, which may benefit future Navy Lighterage. IMAA retains all design rights to PACSCAT craft. 1MM has applied and marketed the concept to a range of commercial and military missions. Previous designs include the Fast Landing Craft (FLC), which is under extensive investigation by QinetiQ Ltd. (formerly DERA) in the UK, and the PACSCAT River Freighter, currently under development with a grant from the European Commission. Tank tests have been carried out by 1MM on a number of PACSCAT designs and the UK Royal Marines and QinetiQ recently tested a 1/3 scale manned model of the FLC. All of this research has contributed to a detailed database and validated PACSCAT performance model and design tools, which remain the property of 1MM. This work has not been  duplicated anywhere else in the world. Due to the uniqueness of the PACSCAT concept, this work can only be performed by the originator. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS however all interested and responsible parties may submit their technical capabilities to the above POC via email harrisonhl@nswccd.navy.mil within 15 days after the publication of this notice. The capability statement and any other information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NSWCCD to determine if the party can fully meet the requirement described above.

Title of Task:   Common Scenario Control Environment (CSCE) Synchro Server 1.  INTRODUCTION  Port Hueneme Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center (PHD NSWC), Integrated Combat System Test Department (ICSTD) is tasked with the continued development, Life Cycle Maintenance (LCM) and technical refresh of CSCE, an open system architecture sim ulation system that supports Combat System Integration Testing (CSIT) and Battle Force Interoperability testing (BFIT) for US Navy combat systems. One of the primary goals in the on-going development of CSCE is to provide an extensible, scalable simulation system. CSCE has been designed to achieve this goal by providing a communications architecture that allows for the distribution of CSCE functionality over systems, components and processors. CSCE currently provides simulated Ownship synchro (analog signals) outputs for heading, pitch, and roll and raw wind synchro outputs for direction and speed to various test bed subsystems. This capability has been integrated into the CSCE Navigation Simulator VME processor. It uses multiple VME bus cards, embedded in the NAV VME chassis, containing digital-to-synchro converters to provide the analog outputs. It has become apparent t hat in order to provide synchro outputs from multiple CSCE units across all the various test bed subsystems requiring analog signals, that a more efficient and more cost effective approach is required. In support of the above requirement, the contractor is to provide system engineering support, hardware procurement/installation, and development/LCM for a remote CSCE turnkey Synchro Server system. Figure 1 depicts a “CSCE Synchro Server Conceptional Block Diagram” as an example of such a system. Tasking will involve evaluating both current and future test bed synchro requirements, hardware and software system engineering, hardware procurement and installation, server application development and CSCE integration, and associated documentation. 2.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of GridGen software maintenance for the period August 1, 2004 through July 31, 2004. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the support from Pointwise, Inc., as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  Pointwise, Inc., is the sole distributor of GridGen Software.  GridGen was originally selected to perform computational fluid dynamic modeling function due to its unique capability to perform this type of internal dimensional analysis.  The maintenance support is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of bugs with delivery of temporary work-arounds, and new documentation as it is published. Should any other software be used, several man-years of work would be lost, and have to be repeated.  Such costs could not be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 19, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Tina Keefe tina.keefe@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the United States Air Force to determine potential sources capable of fulfilling a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) requirement for providing a mapping production system to the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) to support the imagery and mapping data requirements for the F-15K aircraft. One of the primary requirements of the mapping production system is for a hardware and software suite that is capable of scanning paper aeronautical charts and creating the digital image of the charts formatted in National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) specification compliant Compressed ARC Digitized Raster Graphics (CADRG) to be used on the USAF Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS).  The system design should allow for incorporation of software to accommodate GeoTIFF and Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database (MrSID) formats. A second requirement is to process panchromatic and multi-spectral OrbView 2.5 meter and .61meter imagery into NGA specification compliant Controlled Image Base (CIB).  The contractor should provide the capability to expand the system to incorporate imagery from Quickbird, IKONOS or SPOT if the ROKAF subsequently selects to use one or more of these formats.   The seaming of frames must be seamless with no loss of data where seaming frames is accomplished.  Only contractors with highly trained engineers in the field of CADRG and CIB production processes and knowledge of the associated software will be considered. The system must have a means to catalog the NGA formatted data and allow the user to track currency and to easily retrieve catalogued data. The contractor must also support in-country training of ROKAF personnel on the system hardware and software operation.  The training will be conducted in English.   Experience with the DoD Foreign Military Sales (FMS) process as well as working with Asian Countries is necessary. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought Synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this synopsis.  The Government requests interested offerors submit one (1) copy of their capability response no later than 4:00p.m, Eastern Standard Time, on 15 July 2004 to the following address (for first class or overnight mail): ESC/ACK, Attn: Cindy Burrows, 11 Barksdale St., Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-1700.  The response should not exceed five (5) one-sided, 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with the font no smaller than 10 point. Additional Common Mapping Production System (CMPS) information can be obtained from Ms. Tina Keefe at (781) 266-9784.  Please direct any questions on this announcement to Ms Cindy Burrows, Contracting Officer, phone 781-266-9038, or electronic mail cindy.burrows@hanscom.af.mil.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE
PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Methanol/Ammonia Plant in Damietta, Egypt.

U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) signed a feasibility study grant with the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (Echem) for the establishment of an integrated methanol/ammonia plant in the Mediterranean Industrial Zone at Damietta in northern Egypt.  The establishment of an integrated methanol/ammonia plant would expand Egypt’s burgeoning petrochemicals industry, which is a high priority for the national government because of its ability to reduce the country’s foreign currency expenditures and generate foreign currency income and skilled employment.  USTDA has achieved implementation and development results as well as export success in this sector in Egypt in 2003, with Echem’s linear alkyl benzene (LAB) project.  

Echem was established in February 2002 by the Ministry of Petroleum to manage existing publicly held assets and equities in the chemical/petrochemical industry.  Echem is mandated to identify and develop new petrochemical and chemical production opportunities in cooperation with its sister parastal organizations such as the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) and the Egyptian Gas Holding Company (EGAS), and to incorporate private companies and investors.  In December 2003, USTDA hosted a business briefing that featured two earlier USTDA grants made to Echem for linear alkyl benzene production ($756,000) and propane dehydrogenation ($253,000).  Both projects are moving into the implementation phase and have already generated at least $56 million in business with U.S. companies.  

The feasibility study’s terms of reference includes these tasks: prepare market assessment, process technology/licensor selection, conduct site investigation, preliminary environmental assessment, prepare cost estimates, financial and benefit analysis, risk assessment and mitigation analysis, prepare project implementation and financing strategy, and a final report.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $701,801 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, July 26, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to solicit on an Other Than Full and Open Competition basis for the acquisition of Administrative and Clerical Support Services at the Training Air Wing Four (TW-4) located at Naval Air Station, Corpus Christi, TX.  The services will be accomplished through a modification extending the performance period under the existing Purchase Order N00140-01-M-0443.  The extension will consist of a 1-month period. The extension is for commercial services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source (Systeam, 1804 Highway 231 South, Laceys Spring, AL, 35752-3449), under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a).  The purpose of this extension is to allow sufficient time to complete the procurement process for the competitive follow-on contract.  The applicable NAICS code is 561110 with a size standard of $6M. The Government intends to acquire the services from Systeam since they are the only source that currently has the personnel and the infrastructure in place to perform the requisite services by 1 September 2004 without the an additional 30-day phase-in period (starting 2 August 2004) that would be required from a different source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all requests within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis.  The Government will not pay for information received.  Responses to this synopsis should be mailed to the attention of Ms. Kristi Brown, Code 02P23A, FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Ave., Bldg. 2B, Phila., PA 19111-5083.   See numbered notes 1 and 22.  The follow on requirement to Purchase Order N00140-01-M-0443 was synopsized on 23 April 2004 under RFQ number N00140-04-Q-0785. The RFQ was issued on 10 June 2004 and is presently available on the NECO website.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW) for Iraqi Police Service (IPS) Selection Screening Process

1.0	  SUBJECT

The goal of this project is to develop, implement, evaluate and validate an Iraqi nationally standardized screening process that numerically quantifies what psychological profile and level of intellect is acceptable for service within IPS.  

2.0	  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

The Iraqi Police Service (IPS) has never developed or utilized any formal selection screening process.  Selection and hiring of potential police personnel was conducted in a haphazard, non-standard method.  As such, the individuals had no specific personal knowledge, skills or abilities (KSA’s) criterion to be rated against to ensure they met standards attributed to the ideal police candidate.  Due to this, many of the IPS currently employed lack the needed abilities or aptitude for the field of law enforcement.  Further, any number may manifest undesirable personal beliefs and psychological tendencies. 

The police community within the United States, Great Britain and Europe has been successfully utilizing psychological evaluation processes for several decades.   In each instance, a profile of desirable/undesirable traits are defined and validated.  The psychological profile is tailored to achieve several goals.  Initially, to determine if the mind set of the applicant is compatible with Law Enforcement.  It rates the basis of the individual’s integrity and ethical/moral beliefs as well as determining their impetus for becoming a member of Law Enforcement. Further it defines what level of aggressiveness is desired for the type of policing they are being selected to perform.  Also, the profile is used as a tool to identify and eliminate from consideration those with abnormal psychological tendencies and traits. 

The second tool within the selection screening process is that of aptitude testing.  It determines the applicant’s basic intellect and logical abilities.  Through testing of basic mathematics, language and reasoning skills, the applicant’s abilities can be quantified and evaluated for acceptability.

Together, the psychological and KSA profiles are quantitatively rated on a numerical basis to determine the applicant’s overall suitability for Law Enforcement.  
 
3.0	  OBJECTVE 

To develop, implement, evaluate and validate an Iraqi nationally standardized screening process that numerically quantifies what psychological profile and level of intellect is acceptable for service within the IPS.  Once in place, the ability to recruit, train and sustain the IPS will be greatly enhanced with the increase of efficiency and reduction in costs associated with recruiting.  The delivery / performance of this service shall begin on 1 September 2004.

4.0   Training Requirement

4.1  To have a contractor with a proven background in law enforcement screening develop a program for the IPS.  Preferably, the selected contractor will have successful prior experience in developing programs for Mid-East culture(s).  All following objectives are to be part of contractor’s bid.

4.2  Identify/develop psychological profile and testing tailored to Iraq’s culture.  This must be reviewed by specialists with a refined knowledge of Iraqi cultural mores.

4.3  Identify/develop aptitude testing criterion and written test  tailored to Iraq’s culture.  This must be reviewed by specialists with a refined knowledge of the Iraqi culture.

4.4  Define a numerical rating for both the psychological and aptitude testing.

4.5  Define/develop the minimum numerical standard of acceptability for entrance into IPS.

4.6  All aspects of the selection screening documents are to be translated into the Arabic language.  Translated text is to be reviewed by outside unbiased party(ies) to ensure correctness of documents and to address any cultural differences/difficulties. 

4.7  Validate the screening documents by evaluating a selected group or entire class of IPS candidates from before the selection process, during training and in their initial job performance as IPS members.  Estimate screening of approximately 5000 for a class size of 500 qualified candidates.   Contractor required to conduct this process on site at Baghdad Police Academy located in Baghdad, Iraq.


Expected Results

4.8  Once validation is accomplished and any changes made, train the IPS to utilize the process.
  
•	Train specific IPS members (approximately 50) to administer the screening process and develop a syllabus to enable these same members to act as a cadre of instructors to train required cadres throughout the IPS. 

•	To conduct training for this one time class at the Baghdad Police Academy location. 

•	Develop and implement an administrative process to maintain records on the overall screening process. 

•	Create a database to track the program and to identify unsuitable applicants on the national level.

See the following for detailed requirements and proposal information.
MASSIVE ORDNANCE PENETRATOR DEVELOPMENT & DEMONSTRATION
Introduction:
The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/MNAV) is interested in receiving proposals for the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) program.  The proposals will be accepted under the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) number MNK-BAA-04-0001; Armament Technology Research; topic entitled Flight Vehicles Integration Research.  Proposal submittal deadline for the past performance volume is 4:00 PM Central Daylight Time (CDT), 2  Aug 04 and submittal deadline for the technical and price/cost is 4:00 PM CDT, 16 Aug 04. Submit 3 hard copies and 1 CD of all volumes to include past performance, technical and price/cost to AFRL/MNK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Ste 337, Eglin AFB, FL  32542-6810.   A confirmation of receipt will be generated   when proposals are received.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to ensure that confirmation of receipt is obtained by the proposal submittal deadline.  Proposals submitted after the cut-off date specified herein shall be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(c)(3), Instructions of Offerors – Competitive Acquisition.  All proposals received will be reviewed and evaluated using the Proposal Evaluation Criteria found within this document.
Background:
This effort builds on the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) Phase I program.  The objective of this phase was to perform a risk reduction effort for a large penetrating munition and to conduct a study to assess the potential for integration in the B-2/B-52 aircraft.  The large penetrating weapon is being designed for the defeat of a specialized set of hard and deeply buried targets. 
The tasks of the first phase were to evaluate a case design, investigate explosive manufacturing concepts, refine and evaluate the control actuator system and define the guidance kit packaging.  Trade studies were conducted on the aerodynamic configuration; fuze; guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C); guidance kit packaging; accuracy; and flight demonstration options.  Performance predictions against targets were analyzed and a carriage and release concept was developed.
Program Objective:
The goal of the MOP program is to design and test a large penetrating munition, to demonstrate the weapon’s lethality against multi-story buildings with hardened bunkers and tunnel facilities and to reduce technology risk for future development.   
Technical Requirements:
The MOP design will include the capability to defeat hard and deeply buried targets.  It will be carried internally in a USAF B-2A/B-52 bomber and employed at high altitudes.   The munition will attack targets at target altitudes of up to 10,000 ft.  The munition will not exceed 30,000 lbs and will maximize explosive fill while maintaining structural integrity throughout the penetration event.  The munition will be guided and have capability in GPS disrupted environments.  
The main tasks for this program are laid out below.  The program will be structured as a concept refinement task order (TO) with additional task orders for each of the remaining tasks.  It is envisioned that one contract will be awarded.  
TO 1 – Concept Refinement:  TO 1 shall be performed upon receipt of Government authorization to proceed/contract award.  The contractor shall perform a cost /performance analysis (of proposed MOP designs – including platform integration options), a penetrator optimization study, technology investment plan, and propose a Preliminary Design (PD).  The contractor is expected, but not required, to leverage the concept definition work from the MOP Phase I program.  The contractor shall develop a Draft Master Test Plan Outline (DMTPO), which includes all ground and flight tests.  The PD and DMTPO shall be presented at a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) prior to delivery to the Government for final approval.
TO 2 – Weapon Development and Preliminary Testing:  The contractor shall develop a detailed hardware design.  Simulation, aerostability analysis, component testing and other risk reduction activities shall be performed as required.  Subscale models shall be fabricated and wind tunnel tested.  The contractor shall perform and support the wind tunnel testing in accordance with the sponsor-approved Master Test Plan. The contractor shall conduct initial performance testing to include arena, blast lethality and penetration tests. The contractor shall conduct initial qualification tests and static tests.  The Final Design including system specifications and Formal Master Test Plan shall be presented at a Critical Design Review (CDR).  
TO 3 – Weapon Performance Demonstration:  The contractor shall fabricate and integrate the unit to be flight-tested.  It is expected that five drop tests will be conducted.  The contractor shall perform and support the flight testing of the hardware in accordance with the sponsor-approved Master Test Plan.  The contractor shall also provide a final report.
Test Support:
The contractor shall be responsible for all test plans necessary for the maturation and demonstration of the hardware/software products to be tested.  Contractor-generated test plans, as approved by the Government, will become contractual requirements.  For tests being conducted at Government facilities, the contractor shall be responsible for providing technical support, analysis, data and test planning support to the identified responsible Government test organization.  The contractor shall provide test support to include the following: support of test planning meetings; test setup and checkout; test article build up and transportation and checkout; installation of hardware; instrumentation package support; required documentation for testing; identification of risk and suggestions for improvements; record test setup; data collection for evaluation of results; post-test analysis and test result documentation.
Data Requirements: 
It is expected that the following data submittals will be required:  
Study [DI-GDRQ-80567A, Subsystem Design Analysis Report (Study Report)], Status reports [DI-MGMT-80368/T, Status Report], cost/schedule management [DI-MGMT-81334/T, Contract Work Breakdown Structure (Cost/Schedule Breakdown Structure)]; [DI-FNCL-80912, Performance and Cost Report], program review info [DI-ADMN-81250A, Conference Minutes]; [DI-ADMN-81373/T], hardware design/drawings [DI-SESS-81002B, Developmental Design Drawings and Associated Lists], test plans [DI-NDTI-80566, Test Plan], test data [DI-NDTI-80809B, Test/Inspection Report], system specs [DI-IPSC-81432A, System/Subsystem Design Description], and final tech report [DI-MISC-80711A/T, Scientific and Technical Reports, Final Report].
Meetings and Reviews:  
The Government anticipates the following program meetings and reviews:  Kickoff within four weeks of contract start date at offeror’s facilities; Technical Interchange Meetings at times coinciding with key program milestones or decision points that alternate between the offeror’s facilities and Eglin AFB; and a Final Program review at completion of the program at Eglin AFB, FL.  The contractor may propose to conduct or participate in other meetings with subcontractors, Government agencies, or third parties, as deemed necessary.  
Proprietary Items: 
The Government is anticipating unlimited data rights to all data generated to include drawings and results.  The Government highly recommends the proposed design include no parts, materials, or software that are proprietary.  The offeror is responsible for explicitly identifying any proprietary materials, products, software, or processes to be used by the prime contractor or subcontractors in the performance of this program and to address acquisition of data rights or licenses, or expected recoupment of development costs for those proprietary items that will be integral to the hardware and software design and fabricated test items.  Offerors should apply the restrictive notice prescribed in the provision at FAR 52.215-1(e), Instructions To Offerors - Competitive Acquisition, to trade secrets, or privileged commercial and financial information contained in their proposals. 
Additional Information:
(1) Anticipated Period of Performance:  TO 1 is expected to last 6 months with results deliverable in the middle of month 6.  TO 2 is expected to last 10 months and TO 3 is expected to last 15 months.  Total Period of Performance for the Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will not exceed 5 years. 
(2) Type of Contract: The Government anticipates awarding one Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract to the offeror who the Air Force believes has submitted the most advantageous proposal, based upon evaluation using the Evaluation Criteria found within this document.
(3) Government Estimate/Funding:  The Government anticipates receiving approximately $11.5M of FY04-07 funds for this program.  The Government expects TO 1 costs would not exceed $500K, TO 2 costs would not exceed $3M, and TO 3 would not exceed $8M. It is anticipated that an IDIQ contract will be awarded with a maximum ceiling of $20M since it is impossible to accurately estimate all requirements during the five year period of performance. This funding profile is an estimate only and is not a promise of funding, as all funding is subject to changes/availability and Government discretion.  It is desired that contract expenditures be managed and billed so as to maximize FY05 expenditure of FY04 and FY05 funding.  
(4) Government-Furnished Property/Equipment/Information (GFX):  The contractor is responsible for explicitly identifying required GFX, contacting the appropriate Government Agency for its utilization, and including any associated costs within the proposal.   
(5) Size Status:  This acquisition is solicited under full and open competition.  The appropriate NAICS code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. State whether you are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business, HUBZONE small business, Veteran-owned business, nonprofit, educational, or historically black college or university.  
(6) Notice to Foreign Owned Firms:  It is anticipated that all foreign participation at the prime level will be prohibited.  Foreign contractors may be allowed to participate as sub-contractors if prime contractor obtains the appropriate approval from the State Department.    
 (7) Availability of Additional Requirements Information:  A technical library consisting of specific MOP requirements and Phase I MOP results will be available, by appointment, for review.  In order to review these documents, please provide a DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement,  to AFRL/MNK, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Ste 337, Eglin AFB, FL  32542-6810.

(8) Proposal Preparation:  The proposal will be prepared in accordance with Proposal Preparation, Part II of MNK-BAA-04-0001 with the following additional information. 
(a) Prepare a technical and price/cost proposal for TO 1 – “Concept Refinement” and TO 2 – “Weapon Development and Preliminary Testing”.
(b) Prepare a technical proposal only for TO 3 – “Weapon Performance Demonstration”.
The proposals will be reviewed and evaluated using the Proposal Evaluation Criteria found within this document.  Adequate price competition is anticipated. 
(9) Evaluation Criteria:  MNK-BAA-04-0001, Part II PROPOSAL EVALUATION, is amended to reflect the following evaluation factors, listed in descending order of importance for each:
(a) Proposal Evaluation Criteria: 
1.  Technical Merit: Overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission, and extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing the overall research program of this directorate.  This includes the following four sub-factors (listed in descending order of importance):
a.  Soundness of proposed approach to;
1) Meet performance objectives (e.g. range of impact angles, accuracy, penetration capability and survivability, footprint, etc.), 
2) Integrate with aircraft (B-2/B-52),
b.  Technical feasibility (to include risk assessment) of proposed MOP point of departure design and the concept of operation;
c.  Scope of the proposed approach in addressing critical technical issues through the appropriate mix of analysis, modeling and simulation, critical component fabrication, as well as component and wind tunnel testing;
d.  Soundness of offeror’s process to develop a system design, test plans, system specifications, and the final technical report.
2.  Relevant Past and Present Performance:  Offeror’s capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives.  Past performance will be based on work similar in scope (e.g. knowledge of penetrators, GN&C, etc.) and performed during the last 5 years.
3.  Key Personnel:  Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives.
4.  Cost:  Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees.
5.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB) Participation:  Pursuant to FAR 19.12 all proposals will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis as to the extent of participation of SDB.  Offerors will provide targets for SDB participation, expressed as dollars and percentages of total contract value, in the SIC Major Groups as applicable, as well as total target for SDB participation as joint venture partners, team members, or subcontractors.  Failure to submit these targets will render the offeror ineligible for award.  These targets will be incorporated into and become a part of the contract.  
Offerors are reminded that this requirement is different from and in addition to the requirement for submission of a small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1) & (2).

<DESC>CLINICAL CENTERS FOR A CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE LUNG INJURY AND ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME

This is not a request for proposals.  It is anticipated that RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-04 for ten Clinical Centers (CCs) for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Clinical Research Network for the Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) will be available at: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/ funding/index.htm on or about June 10, 2004.  NHLBI will release a separate Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) as RFP-NHLBI-HR-05-05, on or about June 1, 2004. The Network will develop and conduct randomized controlled clinical trials under multiple protocols for the prevention and treatment of ALI/ARDS.  The ARDSNet will function with a Steering Committee (SC) of principal investigators from the CCs and the CCC, and a representative of the NHLBI.  The SC will collaboratively develop, prioritize, and conduct the clinical trials.  The CCs, each consisting of one or more participating Intensive Care Units (ICUs), will enroll a total of 1650 subjects over five and one-half years of a seven-year project.  The actual number of clinical trials will depend upon availability of funds.  Initial Network protocol(s) may be selected from among those proposed by offerors that successfully compete as a CC.  Patient enrollment will consist of appropriate gender and minority representation.  It is recognized that offerors will be limited by the patient population that is admitted in intensive care units, which is determined by the demographics of the local population.  Offerors must address in detail the gender and racial characteristics of their patient population.  Funding decisions may be made with the objective of obtaining a trial-wide patient mix which includes 51% women and 25% minorities.  To achieve enrollment of 30 patients per year, offerors may involve affiliated institutions or hospitals, and/or enter into formal agreements with other institutions.  If necessary, collaborations within a local geographic area are encouraged to facilitate communication and oversight by the PI.  CC staff will be expected to participate in one or more of a number of subcommittees (e.g., publications, ethics, pathology, natural history, and progress assessment) which will hold meetings and teleconferences on an as-needed basis.  CC investigators will attend SC meetings approximately semiannually and participate in teleconferences monthly to discuss progress of the trials, identify concerns about the protocols and/or conduct of the trials, and determine whether changes to the protocols and other trial forms are necessary.  The PI will be responsible for overseeing the quality of patient screening, enrollment, and care, and for achieving a minimum enrollment of 30 ALI/ARDS patients per year.  The PI will have responsibility for maintaining regular communications within his/her CC.  The PI and co-PI will be expected to make intellectual contributions to the development, conduct, and monitoring of trials.  CC personnel will be expected to participate in the development of appropriate and feasible sub-studies.  The project will conclude activities with the submission of final abstracts and manuscripts for publication and presentation, and completion of final limited access data sets by the CCC.  The Government intends to award ten contracts for a period of seven years, on or about September 1, 2005.

Description

The following is a request for information (RFI) for planning purposes only - The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for adding a digital color photograph and text to a pre-printed Certificate of Naturalization Form N-550. 

USCIS is interested in evaluating new color printers capable of producing both text and images on this document.  We are asking for a demonstration of suitable equipment that can fulfill our needs.  The ultimate intention is to procure new color printers for the approximately 100 sites where the certificates are produced. 

The new color printer requirements are:
1)	It must be able to produce durable, tamper resistant images and text. The durability of the images calls for inks that will either penetrate and be absorbed by the paper or otherwise permanently bond to the paper. The document produced by the demonstration will be subject to testing by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Forensic Document Lab (FDL), which will subject the document to a variety of tests using various solvents and other techniques.   
 
2)	The printer must be able to automatically feed and process forms, which have standard text and symbols preprinted on them by an intaglio printer process, without jamming or disturbing the quality of the preprinted paper.  A projected volume of up to 9000 forms per month is projected per printer.

3)	The printer must be able to produce pictures with a resolution of at least 720 Dots Per Inch (D.P.I) as well as standard text.

4)	The printer should be able to produce at least 14 pages per minute.

NOTE: The Forensic Document Lab (FDL) has evaluated printers in the past and recommends ink instead of laser technology.  However, this is not an absolute requirement.

In addition to the technical specifications we would like to obtain estimates of maintenance and materials costs.

PAPER DESCRIPTION:

The specifications of the Certificate of Naturalization are:
Form N-550 Rev. 4/04
Paper size	: 8 by 10 inches.
Paper weight	: 20lbs. writing paper or equivalent
Compatibility:	The paper is laser printer compatible.  It has additives to absorb ink for a laser photo that will prevent the photo from being removed or scraped off. 
Paper surface: No surface coating. 
Photo Area: 	2 by 2 inch

All interested sources shall provide the company name, mailing address, point of contact, email address and a statement of capabilities (SOC) not to exceed 10 pages.   Vendors may be contacted for a product demo and to provide printed samples for analysis and testing by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Forensic Document Lab (FDL).

Responses should be submitted to Peter M. Dietrich at the Burlington Field Support Office, referencing the above sources sought number, at the following address:   Burlington Field Support Office - Contracting 70 Kimball Avenue, South Burlington, Vermont 05403.  Information shall also be submitted electronically to: peter.dietrich@dhs.gov

All responses are due by close of business, 4:30 PM EDT, Friday, July 16, 2004.

THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.   THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNAOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.    NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO NEITHER THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, NOR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.     RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION.

<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is seeking to sign a Letter of Agreement (LOA) to work with a tractor manufacturer to test a seated 3-dimensional anthropometric database that NIOSH has previously established, for evaluating existing cab designs and for new tractor-cab design.  The goal of this project is to advance the safety of operators of tractors by bringing the most updated anthropometric information into tractor design and into the marketplace. This announcement is a business opportunity in that the partner selected will share expertise with NIOSH researchers toward transferring the NIOSH anthropometric data and tractor research results into an improved and marketable product.  

Tractors are workspaces for many agriculture workers.  Well-designed human-tractor interfaces, such as well-accommodated tractor operator enclosures (i.e., cabs, hand-and-foot controls, and protection frames) can enhance worker productivity, comfort, and safety.  Good human-tractor-interface design ensures that a tractor cab and roll-over protective structure (ROPS) will accommodate the body size of agricultural workers.  In the design process for operator cabs, adjustments for brake reach and linkages, seat position, and seat height must be designed to position all potential operators so that they can adequately reach the brake controls and see over the tractor and beyond the protection frames.  In addition, the cab space must to be arranged in such a way that the steering wheel, hand controls, and seat do not hinder the driver’s operation.  Moreover, the dimensions of the ROPS should adequately accommodate tractor drivers during normal operation and protect them from injury during a rollover.  A review of the historical anthropometric sources for the agriculture tractor design standards (ISO-3411-1982, SAE J833-1989, SAE J898-1994) reveals that they are based on dimensions which were derived from U.S. Army population databases collected in the 1960's and 1970's.  An updated anthropometric data set of the nation’s agricultural workers and an adequate anthropometric procedure are needed for establishing validated anthropometric criteria for tractor design.

NIOSH has completed a pilot laboratory study that identified the critical anthropometric measurements related to tractor cab accommodation, and developed representative anthropometric tractor-operator models and the 3-dimensional feature envelopes of their body landmarks for tractor-cab-space design and protection-frame-dimension determination consideration. The 3-dimensional seated scans of 100 participants are available. NIOSH wishes to work with a tractor manufacturer to test the seated 3D anthropometric database for evaluating existing cab designs and for a new tractor-cab design process.  The partner manufacturer will complete the following tasks within 1 year after the LOA is signed: (1) select a tractor model to be evaluated and provide the dimensions that the manufacturer used, (2) develop a study protocol for evaluating the selected model, (3) complete the evaluation of the selected model based on the NIOSH 3D scan data, (4) complete new design of an improved cab system based on the NIOSH data, and (5) provide a study report to NIOSH.

Candidate companies are requested to submit Collaborative Capabilities information (in literature, electronic presentation, or video) at this point to demonstrate their capability to successfully perform the above mentioned tasks.  The Collaborative Capabilities parameters include (A) technical expertise in designing and manufacturing tractors (Required), (B) expertise in utilizing 3D anthropometric information for product evaluation or design process (Required), (C) expertise in preparing and conducting laboratory evaluations of human-product interface (Required), (D) expertise in reviewing test results and recommending design modifications (Required), (E) experience in writing both technical and lay-language reports (Required), and (F) working with standards organizations to provide NIOSH input so that the new anthropometric information can be fully utilized to benefit our workforce (Optional).  Candidate companies which appear to possess the greatest capacity to meet the requirements listed in the Collaborative Capabilities parameters will be evaluated for their capabilities to complete the tasks outlined in the announcement.  This announcement does not obligate NIOSH to sign an LOA with any presented company. NIOSH reserves the right to establish a partnership based on engineering and design capabilities and business commitment found under this announcement or other searches, if determined to be the best interest of the Government. 

NIOSH is seeking an innovative partner to test the NIOSH seated 3D anthropometric database for evaluating existing cab designs and for new tractor-cab design process.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks small characterized animal models for evaluating therapeutics against chronic infections and diseases caused by either hepatitis B or hepatitis C. The Preclinical Research Contracts Branch (PRCB) of the Contract Management Program (CMP) of the Division of Extramural Activities (DEA), NIAID is seeking capability statements from small business organizations with the technical expertise and facilities to support small mammalian animal models (e.g., mice, rats, small primates such as tamarins, tupaias, or marmosets, etc.) of HBV or HCV infection and disease, to test and apprise new drug candidates that may reduce or eliminate viral replication or prevent progression of liver disease.  Results from testing a therapeutic in the animal model should predict human responses.   Important considerations for selecting a model include the guaranteed provision of ample numbers of animals, and the availability of well-documented tools and assays for analysis of outcomes. As dose requirements are based usually on body weight, lighter is better.  Endangered mammals or mammals over 5 kilograms are excluded.   Additionally, HCV models are sought for testing protective vaccine candidates.  The ideal small model is one infected with the human hepatitis virus and that subsequently expresses human-like symptoms and outcomes.  To date, infections by HBV or HCV, complete with their associated disease progressions, are unique to humans.  As evidenced by the success of the woodchuck model for HBV, surrogate infection models such as the marmoset or tamarin infected with the related flavivirus GBV-B are plausible contenders for HCV.  Offerors may propose, however, any small mammalian animal model, including genetically altered or transplant models, which represents aspects of the human infection or viral hepatitis disease process, and also mimics the human response to licensed therapies. The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  Interested Small Business organizations should submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas cited above.  No submission shall exceed a maximum of 25 1-sided pages in a 12-point font.  No collect calls will be accepted and no facsimile transmissions will be accepted. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE NAICS CODE IS 54171 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES OR FEWER.  See contact information above.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK Title:  President Eisenhower's Efforts in Political Warfare This is a follow-on effort to a project funded via a subcontract. Background:  	Under President Truman, the US instituted a wide-ranging political warfare program in the Cold War.  These efforts included covert CIA funding for Radio Free Europe directed to Eastern Europe and Radio Liberty directed at the Soviet Union.  The program included the publicly funded Voice of America broadcasts to both regions as well as to Western Europe.  In Western Europe, it included covert funding to support publications by and for liberal, anti-communist intellectuals.  The efforts also included steps to counter Communist dominance of labor unions in Italy.  Thus, the effort went far beyond the Voice of America to trying to influence the character of the intellectual debate.  It was broadly conceived, serious political warfare endeavor. When Eisenhower had been supreme commander of NATO (1950-1951) before becoming president, he became concerned with the effectiveness of Soviet "peace offensives" against US policies and related anti-Americanism in Western Europe.  He attached great importance to improving US political warfare in the Cold War in Western Europe and elsewhere in the world.  Eisenhower's first executive order on becoming president was to set up a committee on US information activities (the "Jackson Committee), which led a few months later to establishment of the United States Information Agency.   	Toward the end of his second term, in December 1959 he appointed another committee to re-examine US information activities.  It was named the Sprague Committee, after its chairman.  The committee completed its report in December 1960. Importance of Topic:  In dealing today with anti-Americanism, especially in Europe, some suggest our main effort should be a political warfare strategy.   The weight of the effort will be to put together what the Eisenhower effort in political warfare really looked like, providing a detailed description and indicating what it suggests for the war on terrorism. Some key questions to pursue: Under Eisenhower, what did the political warfare effort actually consists of? What were its successes and its failures?  What would be the objectives of a modern program and what might it look like? Tasking: (1)	undertake a preliminary study of memoirs and other books dealing with the psychological warfare in the Eisenhower period (2)	review and copy relevant materials from the Eisenhower and Truman libraries (3)	review more recent reports, such as that of the Hart-Rudman commission (4)	identify what can be done to encourage moderate Islam (5)	produce draft report (6)	interview a few individuals on what currently the US might undertake in political warfare  (7)	produce a final written report Duration:  12 months from contract award Deliverables:   (1)	First quarterly report on research, including summary of results of 2-3 weeks at the Eisenhower Library in Kansas. (2)	Second quarterly report on research, including draft report (3)	Third quarterly report on research, including further efforts in response to Director, Net Assessment's appraisals of and recommendation for change in draft report (4)	Final Report and ultimate product Payment Quarterly progress payments will be made upon completion of deliverables specified above.
