Description
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service intends to negotiate with Qwest Corporation, Resource Allocation, Littleton, CO on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 US c. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source. The Forest Service has a requirement to expand the existing telecommunications circuits in support of moving the Red Rock Ranger District office of the Coconino National Forest in Arizona to a new temporary facility at an existing Forest Service owned administrative site designated as the Beaver Creek Work Center.  This requirement is for three (3) T-1 circuits to connect the temporary Red Rock Ranger District office at the Beaver Creek Work Center to other Government facilities on the Coconino National Forest, and provide interconnect service.    Distance from point of service to point of connection to nearest adequate commercial infrastructure is approximately 17,500 feet.  Terrestrial services are necessary due to limited microwave service facilities in the area. The new terrestrial services must lie within an existing corridor which is under permit by Qwest Corporation.  This corridor traverses rugged rural terrain and portions of the corridor do not have vehicle access.  The vendor will have responsibility for providing and maintaining all equipment/lines and hardware within the permitted corridor. The Government will provide customer side equipment at the point of termination at the Beaver Creek facility.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than the posted responce date.
All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of George Morrissey, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), on behalf of The National Highway Institute, intends to award multiple, 5-year term, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts under which fixed price Task Orders will be issued. The Task Orders may require the development, revision, updating, and/or presentation nationwide of training courses in the broad areas of Structures, Hydraulics and Geotechnical technologies.  

The National Highway Institute (NHI) is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA=s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.  In order for NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message.  Annual issues of the NHI Course Catalog and the NHI web site (http://www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov) contain a list of current course offerings.

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970.  However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.  These avenues need to be explored, and enhancements to the current approaches implemented.

In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise will be required in a variety of areas including, but not limited to: 

Design, construction, inspection, coatings and security of highway structures including bridges, culverts, tunnels and ancillary structures; all aspects of hydrologic and hydraulic engineering; and all aspects of geotechnical engineering related to highway structures.

Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom, distance learning, web-based and/or computer-based self-teaching.  Task Orders may also include other functions relating to training delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance. It may also include the conduct of any research required for the development of a specific course, and other support services that may be required for the promotion of the training program.

All qualified, responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer. The Government intends to award these contracts on the basis of best value after Full and Open Competition.
The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS for copies will be honored. 

Please note that FedBizOpps has a feature called “Interested Vendors List.” Those interested in subcontracting, teaming, supporting, consulting and the like should register (the grey button at the bottom of the synopsis titled, Register to Receive Notification), and prime contractors should review the names posted there.

Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments.

Individual tasks will vary in size and complexity and may require availability of a strong multi-discipline team.  The guaranteed contract minimum is $100,000 (basic year only) per contract and the maximum potential contract value is $30,000,000 over the term of the contract.  A base year plus four one-year option periods is the contemplated contract term.  The average value of SABER construction task orders issued under the current SABER contract is $220,254, ranging from $2,000 to $750,000.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Med
Star Research Institute, 6495 New Hampshire Avenue, RM 201, Hyattsville, MD 20783, to provide echocardiogram analysis for patients with Friedreich’s Ataxia.  

The NINDS is conducting a phase II safety and efficacy study of the drug idebeonon in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia under NIH protocol # 05-N-0245 and currently there is no treatment for this disorder. Idebenone is a synthetic analog of coenzyme Q10, a naturally occurring factor that works in mitochondria to facilitate oxidative phosphorylation and protect against the harmful effects of free radicals. In several small European trails, idebenone has shown promising results as a potential treatment or Fridreich’s ataxia under the aforementioned protocol. Due to this rare and unusual study and it’s low, intermediate and high doses of idebenone in children and adolescents with Frideteich’s ataxia it is important to have the right lab support. This phase II is critical of the outcome of the entire study. Therefore, the Med Star’s expertise and professional analysis will prepare the NINDS for future phases.  The period of performance is 03/06-03/07.

The sole source determination is based upon the knowledge, skills and expertise that Med
Star Research Institute possesses as a result of their successful skills.  This Laboratory has specific experience in measuring the parameters required in the current Friedreich’s Ataxia study that is critical for echocardiogram analysis. This sole source acquisition therefore is justified under the authority contained in 41 U. S.C. 253 © (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2) to make such acquisitions when only one source can meet the agency’s needs. Far 6.302-1(a) (2) states that: “When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and on other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement full and competition need not be provided for.”    


The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.5M. This requirement is prepared and administrated using simplified acquisition techniques and is exempt from FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NO1-60057 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892, Attention: Rosie C.

ATF intends to award several Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) covering a five-year period that will be available for placing calls/orders for services at U. S. and worldwide locations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF will periodically solicit additional offers to add new instructors to the pool.  Therefore, ATF will have recurring open submission periods to receive and evaluate proposals for additional contract instructors. The following schedule depicts the current and anticipated solicitation, submissions and evaluation timeframes:
Proposal Submission Times:
BPA Year 1	Current solicitation period:  November 8, 2005 – December 9, 2005	July 1, 2006 – July 15, 2006

<DESC>The 99th Contracting Squadron seeks award of one or more Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) contracts.  A SABER contract is generally a fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract and may include a wide variety of individual construction tasks as identified in a Prepriced Database that encompass most types of real property maintenance, repair, and construction work.  During the contract period, the Government team will identify various construction objectives required to complete each specific project.  Individual projects may be negotiated or competed among the selected SABER contractors.  Individual construction task orders may be issued to the selected contractor to complete those jobs.  The contractor will be required to manage and successfully accomplish each awarded project and may be required to maintain a management office on Nellis AFB NV.  Construction will be performed in Nevada for areas serviced by the Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) Contracting Office and may include Nellis AFB, Creech AFB, and Tonopah Test Range, all in Nevada.  Individual tasks will vary in size and complexity and may require availability of a strong multi-discipline team.  The guaranteed contract minimum is $100,000 (basic year only) per contract and the maximum potential contract value is $30,000,000 over the term of the contract.  A base year plus four one-year option periods is the contemplated contract term.  The average value of SABER construction task orders issued under the current SABER contract is $220,254, ranging from $2,000 to $750,000.  Offers are solicited only from small business concerns located in SBA Region VIII or IX who are expressly certified by a SBA district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offeror’s approved business plan.  Award will be based on best value using performance-price, trade-off (PPT) procedures.  The government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract.  No paper copies of the solicitation, specifications, or plans or will be issued from this office.  Telephone or fax requests will not be accepted.  The solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about 22 Nov 05.

The guaranteed contract minimum is $100,000 (basic year only) and the maximum potential contract value is $30,000,000 over the term of the contract.  We anticipate that this contract will run concurrent with the current SABER contract for the Base Year and One-Option Period, which will impact the amount of design/cost and task orders issued during this period.  The annual capacity for the current SABER contract is $9 million each for the third and fourth option periods.  We anticipate that we will exceed this annual capacity and therefore require an additional contractor to fulfill the additional requirements.  During the remaining three option periods the new contractor will then have priority on all design/cost and task orders.  
A base year plus four one-year option periods is the contemplated contract term.  The average value of SABER construction task orders issued under the current SABER contract is $220,254, ranging from $2,000 to $750,000.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact), as described below, to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Geologic Hazards Team, has a requirement for two (2) GSM-19F Overhauser Proton Magnetometers, with 0.2 second and 1 second sampling, GPS trigger, and time stamp input, 50 meter Fast sensor and cable, including USGS hardware and software option for use with Trimble Thunderbolt GPS Time and interfacing cables.  This equipment must be compatible with existing equipment currently in use at fourteen world-wide geomagnetic observatories.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the items specified as a sole source from Gem Systems, 52 West Beaver Creek Road, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for services in support of the Security, Intelligence, and Special Programs Deputate (MDA/SI).  MDA intends to utilize its Basic Support Services Program (BSSP) General Services Administration (GSA) ordering procedures to acquire the services described in this notice (information on the MDA BSSP may be found at http://www.mda.mil/barbb/setaserv.htm).  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) category for this requirement is 541710 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES, with a size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is open to all GSA schedule holders; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit only small businesses if a sufficient number are determined to possess the required capabilities.  MDA is seeking business firms under GSA schedule contract sources to support staff augmentation for approximately three (3) on-site staff in support of Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT) and Geo-spatial Intelligence services.  Based on mission requirements, there is a potential for the number of personnel to increase.  Due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, there is the potential for the location of the support requirements to be moved to other geographically dispersed locations during the contract period.  Based on capability statements submitted in response to this notice, the Government will invite only the “most highly qualified” companies to participate in the competition. GSA schedule holders judged best qualified to compete for the work will be sent a draft Request for Quotations package within two (2) weeks of the deadline for submission of capability statements and invited to schedule “1-on-1” meetings with Government representatives to address any questions.  A final RFQ will be released on or about February 14, 2006, with offers due approximately three (3) weeks later.  

The required support includes:  application of data received from Intelligence Community taskings to current and developing Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions.  Work includes: development of collection tasking, data management, and scientific analysis necessary to assess sensors and sensor system support for the detection, classification, and reporting of worldwide ballistic missile activity. 

A draft Statement of Work may be found at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website, https://www.fedteds.gov, using the solicitation number “HQ0006-06-Q-0003”.  The draft Statement of Work will be uploaded to FedTeDS on Tuesday, January 10, 2006.  Businesses must register with the FedTeDS site in order to access this information.  Once the short-list is determined and the formal RFQ released, only firms on the short-list will have access to the FedTeDS HQ0006-06-Q-0003 site.

The resultant order will consist of a Firm-Fixed Price support services contract line item for labor and a Cost contract line item for Other Direct Costs (ODCs).  

The term of the order including options is anticipated to be at least three (3) years.  All positions will be on site within the National Capital Region.  In accordance with BRAC there is the potential for the location of the support requirements to be moved to other geographically dispersed locations.

All personnel require a TOP SECRET clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmental Information.  

Acceptable sources must hold a GSA Schedule, and be able to provide 100% of personnel with TOP SECRET clearances on task order start date which will be 30 calendar days after task order award date.  

GSA schedule contractors who qualify under NAICS 541710 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES are invited to submit to the contracting office as early as possible, but not later than January 20, 2006, a three-page Capability Statement summarizing the corporate strengths in relation to the following criteria: 

1) Describe the qualifications and capabilities of your staff to perform the type of work specified in this notice 

2) Describe your firm’s specific, related past/current DoD experience related to this requirement 

3) Describe your firm’s management approach in managing on-site staff, retention/replacement, authority, responsibilities, and quality control, as well as your ability to provide required clearances at the time of at time of award.  

If planning to team or subcontract, identify the firm(s), their size status and GSA schedule(s).  Be sure to segregate this information on the Capability Statement by firm.   

Also, please specify by name one primary and one alternate Point of Contact within your firm, including the respective telephone numbers and email addresses of those individuals.  

All information must be contained within the three-page capability statement limit, excluding a one-page cover letter (if desired) that will not be evaluated.  Capability Statement submissions will be provided electronically to: Marc Lesser, Contracting Officer, at marc.lesser@mda.mil AND to Niki Heflin, Support Contractor, at Niki.Heflin.ctr@mda.mil.  The subject line for all electronic correspondence shall start with "HQ0006-06-Q-0003".  NOTE:  The MDA Server will delete all "ZIP" type files; so only attach MS Word/Excel compatible files or Adobe Acrobat PDF files in electronic correspondence.

MDA will not acknowledge receipt of capability statements.  If a receipt is desired, firms should submit statements electronically and select “read receipt request” from electronic mail options.

<CONTACT>April Irby at 850-636-6035, or Contracting Officer Mary Hines at 850-235-5389.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC), Florida is seeking sources for manufacture of Personnel Transport Modules (PTMs) for use on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy hovercraft. The PTM is used by the Navy to deliver combat ready Marines from ship to shore aboard LCAC’s (Navy hovercraft).  The PTM is a modularized and multi-configurable hard structure designed to secure to the open cargo deck of LCAC in order to protect its occupants from the elements inherent in a hovercraft environment, including wind, noise, sea spray, blowing sand, dirt, and debris, and hot exhaust gases.  The PTM is designed as a deployable pack-up kit, and stows aboard amphibious shipping in one 8 ft x 20 ft ISO container.  The assembled structure provides seating with lap belts, lighting, a forced ventilation system, and is capable of accepting litters for Medevac operations.  The structure consists primarily of lightweight panels incorporating sealing and attachment means at the edges, and all PTM parts are lightweight and portable to allow transport and assembly on the LCAC deck by hand only, without need of crane or forklift.   The US Navy seeks to take advantage of any anticipated in-place and active manufacturing lines planned to produce PTMs for other customers, to leverage off the manufacturing process in order to buy one or more PTMs in addition to those already being produced.  This will benefit both the existing customers and the US Navy by taking advantage of economy-of-scale factors in raw materials procurements and production line set-up and learning curves.   This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent  (ISEA) research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2006-2007.  PTMs could be acquired for Test and Evaluation purposes, in order to evaluate potential design changes and improvements compared to the current PTMs already in service with the US Navy.  Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and characteristics of the PTM design to be produced.  They should also include planned production schedules, and estimated system procurement costs.  Descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror.

<DESC>This is not an RFP, but a survey to locate potential small businesses capable of performing the proposed work.  The US Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Office of Atmospheric Program?s (OAP) has initiated a multi-year assessment program to determine the feasibility of implementing advanced measurement technology systems as next generation monitoring equipment for the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) program.  Recent advancements in instrument technology have now made it possible to consider robust, high temporal resolution ambient air measurements for use in long-term, routine monitoring networks.  Specifically, EPA is interested in specialized instrumentation capable of providing automated measurements with at least hourly resolution of both nitrogen and sulfur-containing gaseous and aerosol species. Primary support of this contract shall be to provide a field measurement system that meets performance specifications and verification for the real-time measurement of ambient gaseous and aerosol concentrations.  At a minimum, the instrument shall measure sulfur dioxide, ammonia, nitric acid, and particulate sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium with a detection limit at or below 1.0 ug/m3 for all species.  The system?s performance characteristics shall allow for up to 7-days unattended operation in remote locations with an operational environment of 25 degrees C +/- 10 degrees C.  The instrument shall be ready for deployment in a pilot operation for evaluation of measurement criteria and quality assurance testing in a routine monitoring mode.  The systems shall be designed for installation at existing CASTNET site shelters and infrastructure. Information obtained from this evaluation will allow EPA to determine the feasibility of broader deployment of this system at sites across the U.S. and the Contractor must demonstrate the capability  to produce multiple systems (10-20) within a 12 month period.  The Contractor shall provide detailed documentation on the operational procedures, maintenance, and quality assurance of the measurement system in advance of field deployment.  The main objective of this requirement is to evaluate emerging monitoring technology to determine the feasibility of enhancing the monitoring and assessment capability of the network as well as other Agency monitoring initiatives.  It is anticipated that these systems will meet several Agency monitoring goals such as those outlined in the National Air Monitoring Strategy (http://www.epa.gov/ttn/amtic/monitor.html) and in coordination with States, local, Tribal governments and regional planning organizations. The purpose of this announcement is to determine the availability and capability of small business firms to perform the above-described activities.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516.  Interested small businesses must demonstrate in their qualification statements that they are qualified to perform work under this NAICS code.  This is a request for interested small business firms to submit a qualification statement of no longer than 10 pages to determine whether or not this procurement will be set aside for the small business program. This is not a request for a technical or cost proposal.  This request is for information and planning purposes and the Government will not pay or otherwise reimburse respondents for information submitted.  Based upon responses received, the Government reserves the right to set aside any and all procurements that may result hereunder for small businesses.  Interested businesses must demonstrate and will be evaluated on specific prior project experience and skill in the following areas:  instrumentation development, field audits of air quality monitoring stations and quality assurance, field instrumentation, and data collection and laboratory procedure capabilities.  The qualification statement should describe specific prior experience in these areas and the capabilities of personnel to meet this experience.   General information on firm size (employees/revenue), location, financial revenues, other contracts for related work, both federal and commercial shall be provided.  Small businesses shall submit two (2) copies of the requested information in writing to U.S. EPA, Attn:  Denise Roberson (3803R), mailing address, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460 or hand delivery to U.S. EPA, Bid and Proposal Room 61107, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20004, or one (1) electronic copy to roberson.denise@epa.gov; NLT March 17, 2006.  Information regarding this procurement will be posted to http://www.fbo.gov as it becomes available.  Telephone requests for information will not be honored.

A firm fixed-price type contract is anticipated for this effort with a Period of Performance of one (1) Base Year, with two (2) one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government as per FAR 52.217-9. However, the Government encourages interested offeror to provide feedback on a suggest Contract Type other than Firm Fixed Price, that would increase efficiency and/or maximize performance. The anticipated basic contract will specify the requirements to be delivered in accordance with the SOW.

<DESC>Description:  U.S. Special Operations Command is seeking information from industry to determine potential sources of protective eyewear (spectacles) for military field use.  There is currently no SOF specific standard issue ballistic and laser protec tive eyewear.  This sources sought announcement is calling for product literature on commercially available spectacles (a kit with interchangeable lenses) that will provide eye protection from harmful UV A/B/C light, ballistic fragmentation meeting or exce eding MIL-STD-662 and MIL-PRF-31013, and laser protection, with OD greater than 4.  Information sought includes product description, business size, pricing, and literature on spectacles product having: high performance optics, meeting ANSI 787.1-2003 tests  on impact resistance and optical performances: prismatic power, haze, optical distortion, neutrality, photopic luminous transmittance.  Looking for goggles: lightweight, scratch resistant, maximum field of view, minimal fogging (anti-fogging), compatible with CVC and MICH helmets, MICH communication systems, currently fielded optical systems (NVGs, thermals, scopes), and all current weapons systems, prescription compatible, with a crush-resistant hard case.  All lenses must pass the ballistic requirement, and afford sun, wind, dust, and ballistic protection in extreme environments.  Allowable ballistic testing parameters include the following exceptions from MIL-STD-662: electronic velocity detection devices (light beam or acoustic type) may be used to dete rmine the velocity of the projectile; such devices placed no less than 8 inches and no more than 24 inches from the target; compressed gas propulsion of the projectile may be used.  The spectacles shall be mounted on the Alderson 50th percentile male head from in the as-worn position.  The 0.002 inch thick aluminum foil witness sheet shall be mounted within 14 mm of the spectacles behind the area of impact.  The spectacles shall be hit once with a 1.5 caliber, 5.8 grain, T37 shaped projectile at 640 to 660 feet per second (once on the left side and once on the right) at normal incidence to the lens within a 1-inch diameter at a point centered on the horizontal centerline and 32 mm from the vertical centerline, and again at the vertical centerline where appro priate.  The test shall be considered a failure if the aluminum foil witness sheet is punctured, if the lens is cracked, or if one or more fragments or eyewear components (including the lens) is completely ejected or breaks away from the frame upon impact.   This applies to a prescription lens placed behind the ballistic protective lenses also.  Alternate materials (non-shattering) are sought for consideration as the prescription lens for use in the kit, for consideration in lieu of the standard CR39 militar y lens material.  Pricing of such materials in support of individual Rx mail-in orders/turned around to a single domestic logistic supply destination, is encouraged.  Frame colors sought: earth tones, not black.  The spectacle kit sought should have the fo llowing ballistic lenses: a clear lens, low light, dark shade, and laser lens.  The spectacles need to be acceptable to the SOF operators, giving them the confidence they need to see while performing their mission, so that they will wear them under threate ned conditions instead of removing them.  Berry Amendment. This sources sought is subject to Berry Amendment, 10 USC 2533a.  Vendors who believe they have a product(s) capable of meeting this requirement are requested to provide literature, brochures, pric e lists, warranty coverage, business size and any other relevant information.  Buy American Act applies.  All components of the spectacle kit must be made and assembled in the USA.  All aspects of the production and replacement parts shall be conducted in the USA.

<ARCHDATE>06202006
<CONTACT>Cheryl Miles, 301-619-7148
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY FOR THE U.S. ARMY CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL H EALTH RESEARCH (USACEHR), FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND.   Its mission is to direct and conduct research, development, testing and validation for the medical aspects of environmental surveillance and environmental health in support of force health protection.  US ACEHR has been evaluating toxicity sensor technologies to identify drinking water hazards associated with a broad range of toxic industrial chemicals.  Toxicity sensors under consideration include cell-based systems and small multicellular organisms with a  range of endpoint measurements (fluorescence, bioelectrical signals) and maintenance requirements (frozen until use, holding under controlled environmental conditions).  Toxicity sensors are intended to respond to a wide range of toxic industrial chemical s to complement the chemical-specific detection capabilities of available water quality monitors. Specifically sought is the capability to design a prototype platform that can house two to four selected toxicity sensor systems.  The platform should provide  for holding cell-based systems prior to use as well as toxicity testing and data analysis related to drinking water sample evaluation.  Modular design is desired to facilitate addition or substitution of new sensor technologies as they become available. Although size and power consumption should be minimized, the initial prototype will not require battery operation or in-field operation.  The operational environment for the platform should be similar to that found at a domestic water treatment plant.  Int erested parties should provide a short summary statement indicating qualifications, key staff, and expertise relevant to development of prototypes such as the one described above.  After toxicity sensor evaluations have been completed, the summary statemen ts provided will help identify potential candidates for prototype design and construction.  However, this announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement w ill be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement.  This synopsis is for information and planning  purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Each response must reference the Sources Sought title.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be held confidential. Please submit summary statement s of company qualifications to: USACEHR, ATTN: MCMR-CDE (Dr. van der Schalie), 568 Doughten Drive, Fort Detrick, MD, 21702-5010.  Alternatively, summary statements may be e-mailed to: toxicitysensor@DET.AMEDD.ARMY.MIL.   Responses must be received no later  than April 21, 2006 by 2:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.

<SUBJECT>D -- Digital Telecomm. Switching (DTS2) System
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to extend the term of the Digital Telecommunications Switching (DTS2) System contract No. TIRNO-01-D-00009 to Verizon Federal Inc. for a base period of six (6) months (April 1, 2006 through September 30, 2006) and one twelve (12) month option period (October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007).  The DTS2 contract, after exercising FAR clause 52.217-8--Option To Extend Services, will expire March 31, 2006.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303© of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253©(1),] implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of Treasury has a continuing need for the DTS2 System.  The extension of the DTS2 contract allows for uninterrupted DTS2 services for the Department of Treasury.  This extension enables Treasury to mitigate risks to this mission critical infrastructure protection asset and allow for successful transition to a follow-on contract vehicle.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

This can be obtained at http://www.arnet.gov/far/farqueryframe.html, 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration. (Oct 2003) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757. The Contractor shall be registered in the CCR and ORCA database.  (1) The Contractor shall maintain registration during performance and through final payment of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page, the annotation DUNS# followed by the DUNS#.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in South Dakota requires the services of an appraiser for the performance of appraisal services in the acquisitions of easements under the Wetlands Reserve Program and the Emergency Watersheds Protection Program.  This announcement constitutes the only notice.

All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP), Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.  
Yellow Book and USPAP Conflicts:  Conflicts between Yellow Book and USPAP are minimal.  When there is conflict, Yellow Book takes precedence.  It may be necessary to invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to USPAP to meet certain standards of the Yellow Book.  Invocation of the Jurisdictional Exception Rule should never be invoked lightly and must include citation of the over-riding Federal policy, rule, or regulation that requires it.  Any jurisdictional exceptions not specifically cited in the Yellow Book shall be discussed with the assigned review appraiser.

PROJECT INFORMATION:

The Government contemplates the award of three indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts in three areas of South Dakota.  The three areas are as follows:

Area 1:  Buffalo, Jerauld, Sanborn, Miner, Lake, Moody, Lyman, Brule, Aurora, Davison, Hanson, McCook, Minnehaha, Tripp, Gregory, Charles Mix, Douglas, Hutchinson, Turner, Lincoln, Bon Homme, Yankton, Clay and Union.

Area 2:  Brown, Marshall, Roberts, Day, Spink, Clark, Codington, Grant, Hamlin, Deuel, Beadle, Kingsbury, Brookings, Campbell, McPherson, Walworth, Edmunds, Potter, Faulk, Sully, Hughes, Hyde, and Hand.

Area 3:  Harding, Perkins, Corson, Butte, Meade, Ziebach, Dewey, Haakon, Stanley, Jones, Mellette, Todd, Bennett, Jackson, Shannon, Fall River, Custer, Pennington, and Lawrence.

The initial contract period will be for one year and the government may, at its option, extend the contract to a maximum of five years by exercising each of the four, one year renewal options.  Work under each contract will be subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders.  Task orders will be negotiated as firm fixed price procurements for the following acreage increments:

1-500 acres
500-1000 acres
1000-1500 acres
1500-2000 acres

APPRAISER QUALIFICATIONS
 
Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in the state(s) where the subject property is located and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended, such as eminent domain or conservation easements, and Yellow Book course shall be provided to the NRCS authorized official prior to issuing any work order.  

PURPOSE OF THE APPRAISAL REPORTS

The purpose of the appraisals is to provide an opinion of market value, as defined below, of the entire subject property (larger parcel) before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the entire subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value. The appraiser shall recognize that in a before and after appraisal, the partial interest being acquired is not actually being appraised.  What is appraised is the larger parcel before and after the conveyance of the partial interest.  
The purpose of two opinions of value is to establish the effect on value resulting from imposition of a conservation easement.  The price of the easement is the before value of the entire property (larger parcel) minus the value of the entire property as encumbered by the WRP or EWP Warranty Easement Deed, after value, provided there are not adjustments such as excess irrigation water rights explained below, which would equal the price of the easement.  A key concept in this appraisal process is defining the larger parcel is required to begin the appraisal process. The appraisals must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS. 

 For the purpose of these appraisals, the Federal Rules for acquisition will be used.

The market value definition that will be stated and used in developing and reporting this assignment is the definition as stated in the Yellow Book;
“Market value is the amount in cash, or in terms reasonably equivalent to cash, for which in all probability the property would have sold on the effective date of the appraisal, after a reasonable exposure time on the open competitive market, from a willing and reasonably knowledgeable seller to a willing and reasonably knowledgeable buyer, with neither acting under any compulsion to buy or sell, giving due consideration to all available economic uses of the property at the time of the appraisal.”  

This definition makes no linkage between the estimated market value and exposure time.  A specific exposure time shall not be cited in an appraisal report prepared under Yellow Book standards.  Invoke the Jurisdictional Exception Rule to avoid a violation of USPAP standards, which require a specific exposure time.

No other definition of market value is acceptable.

(Please see the Statement of Work for detailed information relative to the format, etc. of the appraisal report)
 SELECTION CRITERIA:  (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Objectives:  Provide water treatment to the DMEA water based HVAC heat transfer systems to: a. Maintain all chiller condenser loop equipment (including chillers, cooling towers, piping and components) to be free of scale, biological contamination and corrosion.  Keep heat transfer surfaces clean and efficient so as to minimize energy use. b.  Maintain the hot and chilled closed loop systems (including boilers/chillers, piping and components) to be free of corrosion and biological contamination.  Keep heat transfer surfaces clean and efficient so as to minimize energy use.  c. Keep HVAC system water properly treated to ensure the health of DMEA employees and contractor staff is not negatively impacted by exposure to HVAC system water or mists.  d.  Minimize the use of water and chemicals while accomplishing objectives a, b and c above.  c.  Properly contain biocides, inhibitors and other water treatment products so as to ensure worker safety and environmental compliance.  II.  DMEA Systems Included:  1.  Two each 500-ton Trane chillers (primary and alternate are alternate weekly).  The cooling load on the one operating chiller is typically 40-50% of capacity.  There are two each- two cell cooling towers (BAC 15325-2D http://www.baltimoreaircoil.com/english/info_center/drawings/1500_draw.html#15325 ) that alternate operation with the chillers, each equipped with a sand filter system.  2.  Two hot water boilers and associated hot water piping and equipment serving 16 roof mounted air handlers and various fan coil units (in warehouse areas and office variable air volume boxes).  The total water volume of the system is unknown.  The system is equipped with a pot feeder.  3.  Chilled water loop system serving 16 roof mounted air handlers and various fan coil units (in warehouse areas and office variable air volume boxes), as well as computer air conditioning (CAC) units located throughout the facility.  The total water volume of the system is unknown.  The system is equipped with a pot feeder.  III.  Specific Requirements:  The contractor shall:  1.  Provide all Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and effective treatment parameters (concentration ranges, pH, conductivity, treatment frequency and volume for biocides) for water treatment products used and systems treated at DMEA.  2. Supply, configure, install, integrate and maintain a fully automatic cooling tower water treatment system to help meet the objectives.  The system shall, at a minimum include: a.  Digital water treatment controller with continuous, real-time condenser water conductivity display and conductivity remote output, conductivity control, accurate inhibitor application and dual biocide application capabilities.  Inhibitor application based on make-up or blow down volume is preferred over traditional “bleed and feed”.  A non-pulsing blow down meter is installed on the blow down line.  There are no meters on the make-up water lines.  b.  An inhibitor metering pump.  c.  Either two biocide metering pumps or one biocide metering pump and a brominator with associated automatic control valves.  d.   sample stream including flow switch, conductivity probe, chemical injection quills and a sample port.  e.

Provide, deliver, install, and apply all water treatment chemicals as required to fulfill the objectives above and maintain water treatment parameters 24 hours and day, seven days a week.  All chemical handling, application and testing shall be accomplished by the water treatment contractor.  No testing or chemical handling shall be done by DMEA employees.  The contractor shall remove all empty containers generated from water treatment activities.  The water treatment chemicals shall include:  a.  Cooling tower scale and corrosion inhibitor.  The addition of silica control polymers is recommended due to silica in the make-up water when the Sacramento Suburban Water District uses their well sources.  Make up water conductivity is subject to significant variation due to changing water sources used by the Sacramento Suburban Water District.  b.  An oxidizing biocide suitable for use at cooling tower pH levels.  c.  non-oxidizing biocide or bio-dispersant.  d.  Closed loop inhibitor (sodium nitrite based to be compatible with existing treatment with additives to protect yellow metals too).
e.  Note that deviation from the above treatment product categories will be considered by the DMEA Technical Representative if conclusive evidence is provided that the alternative approach proposed is safe and effective.  4.  Apply biocides as necessary to meet the above objectives and provide bacteria counts of less than 105 colony forming units (CFU)/ml.  5.  Keep the cooling tower basin free on slimes and algae.
6.  Provide in-service containers and double containment providing at least 20% more capacity than the in-service container.  Label all containers and spill containment vessels.  7.  Conduct service visits as often as necessary to fulfill the objectives.  At least monthly the water treatment contractor shall:
a. Visual inspect the water treatment system and treated systems.  Correct any deficiencies noted with the treatment system and annotate action take in the service report.  Note any HVAC system leaks of other conditions requiring DMEA correction (leaking pump seals, etc.) in the service report and immediately via telephone to the DMEA Technical Representative as warranted.  b.  Conduct make-up water tests:  Conductivity, pH, and, if conductivity is +/- 50 microsiemen from the prior months visit: silica, hardness and alkalinity.  Annotate results in the service report.  c.  Conduct condenser water tests:  Inhibitor concentration, conductivity, pH, total bacteria count (dip slide), cycles of concentration.  Annotate results in the service report.  E-mail dip-slide results after the required culture period.  d.  Conduct closed loop water tests: Inhibitor concentration, conductivity, pH, iron concentration (iron test only required when water has any visual yellow tint).  Annotate results in the service report.  e.  Annotate water treatment product applied and volume used in the service report.  f.  Provide the written service report to the DMEA technical representative within 3 days of the service visit.  g.  Maintain on on-site log of water parameters (conductivity and treatment levels).  8.  Respond to trouble calls within 4 hours during normal working hours and 6 hours after duty hours.  IV.  Security:  DMEA is a secure Department of Defense facility.  Water Treatment Contractor employees must be US citizens and are subject to a background investigation prior to conducting unescorted visits to DMEA.  The water treatment contractor shall limit the number of employees servicing DMEA to no more than 3 to avoid unnecessary investigation costs without specific authorization from the DMEA Technical Representative.  V.  Regulatory Compliance:  The water treatment contractor shall maintain compliance with all Federal, State and local requirements for the sale, distribution and application of biocides and other hazardous materials.  VI.  Other Information:  1.  Maintenance:  DMEA’s HVAC contractor conducts monthly preventative maintenance on the chillers and cleans the chiller tube bundle annually.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required;5 and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered “long-term” and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, “intermittent” is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.  
b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department’s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer.  The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge.  The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.

3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM.  Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block  " B "  of the  " Agency Use Only "  section of the investigative form.  This report is available for all case types.

5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.

(b)	The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is responsible for issuing and administering regulations that require contractors to apprise its employees of all hazards to which they may be exposed in the course of their employment; proper conditions and precautions for safe use and exposure; and related symptoms and emergency treatment in the event of exposure.

(c)	Prior to commencement of work, contractors are required to inspect for and report to the contracting officer or designee the presence of, or suspected presence of, any unsafe condition including asbestos or other hazardous materials or working conditions in areas in which they will be working.

Such notice shall include the contractor's recommendations for the protection and the safety of Government, contractor and subcontractor personnel and property that may be exposed to the unsafe condition.

(e)	When the Government receives notice of an unsafe condition from the contractor, the parties will agree on a course of action to mitigate the effects of that condition and, if necessary, the contract will be amended. Failure to agree on a course of action will constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.

(f)	Nothing contained in this clause shall relieve the contractor or subcontractors from complying with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, codes, ordinances and regulations (including the obtaining of licenses and permits) in connection with hazardous material including but not limited to the use, disturbance, or disposal of such material.
