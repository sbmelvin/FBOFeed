<DESC><br />The National Cancer Institute intends to negotiate a sole source modification(s) with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center HHSN261200622002C, the University of California at Davis -HHSN261200622009C, the University of Chicago - HHSN261200622001C, Montefiore Medical Center - HHSN261200622004C, the Mayo Clinic - HHSN261200622005C, H.

The Government is currently conducting the Early Therapeutics Development with Phase II Emphasis which has created a flexible platform so that early clinical trials consortia are prepared to rapidly evaluate the biologic effects of NCI-sponsored anticancer agents on their molecular targets and to determine clinically-relevant correlates. This scalable mechanism, which permits the formation of flexible consortia in response to scientific opportunities, has provided the majority of the essential clinical trials infrastructure and laboratory support to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI for complex Phase II trials in its partnerships with academia and industry.
<p>The proposed sole source modification to the current contract(s) will allow for a 3-6 month extension of the current contract(s) until the competitive acquisition for the follow on contract(s) which are planned to be awarded by February 28, 2011, and to also allow for a completion period in the event the incumbent(s) are not successful in the competitive acquisition process. Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source. This extension will support the uninterrupted continuation of clinical trials involving the treatment of cancer patients. The current contractors are uniquely qualified by virtue of their ongoing performance because they have the appropriate administrative and technical infrastructure in place for clinical trials, both currently ongoing and in review (e.g. Institutional Review Board (IRB) and patient consents, etc.), and have established the necessary relationships with the subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials. If this effort were to be awarded to any other contractor it would result in the disruption of treatment of subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials, which would be unethical. In addition, it would take approximately 3-6 months for other contractors to establish infrastructure (clinical setting, IRB and FDA approvals, and the recruitment of subjects) and be able to perform at the same level as the current contractor. This would result in unacceptable delays to the government and result in a duplication of costs which competition of this requirement unfeasible.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested persons may identify their interests and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed modification, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions posed by interested parties.  
1)	VA has multiple medical facilities in the current 50 states and territories. A current article stated 153 facilities are being looked at. Will this project be a Veteran Set-aside based on RFI responses?  
ANSWER:  This information is not known at this time and will be determined later in the acquisition process. 
2)	Will a listing of the states be provided at this time? 
ANSWER:  A listing of all Medical Facilities is not available at this time.  
3)	Why does the VA require cellular internet service over a Wi-Fi service?
ANSWER:   The RFI makes note of both Wi-Fi and 3G, the potential exists that certain facility areas will not be structurally capable of supporting wireless access points, therefore the medical center management may deem the coverage essential enough that cellular service may be requested as an alternative.
4)	Will the VA consider Wi-Fi infrastructure as a wireless internet solution? 
ANSWER:  Yes
5)	Will a GSA schedule be required for VGIA project? 
ANSWER:  This information is not known at this time and will be determined later in the acquisition process.
6)	What is the uplink and downlink Megabytes per second (Mbps) requirement?   
ANSWER:  The requirements are listed.  We are not specifically requiring network speed minimums or maximums.
7)	Will each facility require service for each in room patients only or will there be a requirement for general facility areas, i.e. hallways, lobbies, waiting rooms, staff offices, etc.
 ANSWER:  This depends on the specific facility, but there is a potential for all of the above.
8)	What are the IP security requirements?  
ANSWER:  The security requirements are listed in the Draft Technical Requirements which were posted as an amendment to this RFI.  
9)	Does the VA require a call center setup with 24 x 7, 365 days out of the year service? 
ANSWER:  For IT staff access only.  
10)	We believe the NAICs Code for this RFI should be 517110 rather than the published 517210. The VA's chief information officer has been quoted as saying that broadband cellular wireless should be used as an alternative to Wi-Fi. Which service provider is best suited for the VA at this time? 
ANSWER:  Thank you for the NAICS code suggestion.  We will look into this.  
11)	Is there a preference between, GSM, UMTS , EVDO, HSDPA, WiMax,  or other third generation (3G) or pre-fourth generation (LTE) technology ? 
ANSWER:  No
12)	Is there an estimate of the number of users per facility that includes the number of bed patients and facility personnel? 
ANSWER:  Not at this time. This number would be dependent on the facility.  
13)	In the event of a power outage, are each of the facilities equipped with a redundant power supply or will an alternative power source be required, i.e. Solar, UPS, etc?  
ANSWER:  Yes
14)	Does this RFI include a DSL or Cable provider for providing the internet service?  
ANSWER:  No
15)	Will laptop computers or other type of internet capable infrastructure be required, i.e. Google TV?  
ANSWER:  No
16)	Will the VA consider a 3-5 day extension for this RFI response? 
ANSWER:  The RFI response date was extended to December 7, 2010 via an amendment that was posted to FBO.  
17)	Will this be a multi-award or single award?  
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time.  We are in the planning stages of the process and assessing the market with this RFI.  
18)	How many of the medical facilities are considered rural?  
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time.
19)	Will there be any limiting requirements regarding cellular frequencies being used in a hospital environment (i.e., commercial service radio frequencies versus MRI, CT Scanners, other medical devices)?   
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time, but there is potential for the above to exist.  
20)  We would like to understand if the VA is interested in implementing completely separate wireless access points and network infrastructure to support guest access, or if a separate SSID and security settings should be used on the existing wireless AP and controllers? Using the existing equipment would be as secure, and would be much more cost effective.
ANSWER:  VA is interested in a completely separate wireless access points and network infrastructure to support guest access.
21)  Please explain the need for PCI compliance requirements, if this network will be a separate network from the hospital operational WLAN network?
ANSWER:  From the PCI Compliance Guide, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that ALL companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.  Essentially any merchant that has a Merchant ID (MID).
The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) was launched on September 7, 2006 to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards with focus on improving payment account security throughout the transaction process.  The PCI DSS is administered and managed by the PCI SSC (www.pcisecuritystandards.org), an independent body that was created by the major payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.). 
It is a compliance standard that has been applied to the current national wireless infrastructure upgrade.

<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) in Natick, MA, is conducting a market survey for technical information from US and/or foreign vendors on methods to create a container that can be used for storage, transportation and airdrop of individually packaged food and water items as part of a humanitarian airdrop effort.  The current humanitarian airdrop capability includes components that are too large and/or descend too fast for safe descent directly over a population, as this creates a significant risk of human injury of the receiving population.  <BR><BR>This effort is aimed at the ability to airdrop and disperse individual food and water items directly over a population with minimal to zero risk of human injury.  The container would be used to store the individual food and water items in a warehouse at bases to be determined around the world.  Once a need for humanitarian relief occurs, these containers would be loaded onto C-130 and C-17 (Threshold) or other coalition aircraft (Objective) for immediate disaster response.  Disaster response would be in the form of an airdrop over the population in need from altitudes of between 2,000 ft Above Ground Level (AGL) to 35,000 ft Mean Sea Level (MSL).  Safe descent is necessary as many in the population may be exposed to being hit by food, water or container components if they are outside.<BR><BR>Desired characteristics for this container include the following: <BR>* Multi-use in storage, transport and airdrop; <BR>* Ability to open and/or be torn apart upon deployment from the aircraft to dispense food and water contents<BR>* Footprint no greater than 48 inches by 48 inches and compatible with USAF C-130 and C-17 rollers and rail systems (Threshold)<BR>* Provide 2G's of vertical restraint and 1.5G of lateral restraint without the need for items to be handled by the aircrew in flight<BR>* Ability to fall (as one piece or in pieces) slow enough to significantly minimize or prevent the risk of human injury if the box landed on someone in the population (Impact force of less than 3,000 Newtons (N) (Threshold), 1,000 N (Objective))<BR>* Height no taller than 80 inches (Threshold), or ability to be manufactured at heights between 80 inches and 100 inches (Objective)<BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. government. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information. This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited. A pre-solicitation notice will be published if a formal solicitation is generated. No awards will result from this request.

<DESC>Description:  The United States Army Contracting Command - Rock Island Contracting Center is seeking to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing the Light Weight (LW) 30MM M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge, NSN 1305-01-268-9373, Part Number 12902728 and the Lightweight (LW) 30MM M788 Target Practice (TP) cartridge, NSN 1305-01-268-7274, Part Number 12902727.  The LW 30MM M789 HEDP is a tactical cartridge and the LW 30MM M788 TP is a non-tactical cartridge. <BR><BR>Special equipment and facilities are required to produce these cartridges.<BR><BR>The M788 is a Target Practice (TP) 30mm cartridge that is a ballistic match to the M789 High Explosive Dual Purpose (HEDP) cartridge.  Production of the cartridges is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.<BR><BR>The manufacturing process for the M789 and M788 cartridges encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) manufacturing of projectiles, fuze parts, and copper liners, (2)fuze production, (3) production of propellant, (4) flash tube loading, cartridge case priming and loading with propellant and (5) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  The LAP for M789 cartridges requires highly specialized facilities, equipment, and tooling for the safe storage, handling, transportation, weighing, consolidation and testing of high explosives and fuzes. In most cases the production processes dealing with high explosives and fuzes must be performed remotely.  The facilities must be specially designed and fabricated to meet DOD hazard/safety standoff requirements in order to mitigate the risk of propagation in the event of an unintended initiation of explosive materials.  Additionally the LAP personnel must be specially trained to work with explosives.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment is required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  An approved ballistics test range, M230 MANN barrels and M230 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic and x-ray test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Other critical skills required to manufacture the M789 include, but are not limited to, ammunition process/design engineers, explosive experts, set-up mechanics and operators, quality control engineers, certified ultrasonic and x-ray technicians, metallurgists and ballistics test personnel.<BR><BR>Specifications: These cartridges are procured to Technical Data Packages (TDPs) which are classified as Distribution Statement "D".  Distribution Statement D means distribution authorized to the Department of Defense and U.S. DOD contractors only (Critical Technology).  This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., Section 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50, U.S.C., app 2401, et seq.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office.<BR><BR>Planned Acquisition: The Government is seeking interested sources to fulfill Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 through FY 2017 requirements.<BR><BR>Submission Information: Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the M789 and M788 cartridges are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government:  1) A brief summary of their company's capabilities, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience, 2) Their monthly production capacities with assumptions about number of shifts and any other production factors that may affect their monthly capacities, and 3) The advantages of combining production of the M789 and M788 into a single procurement.  Response shall be submitted to: Army Contracting Command - Rock Island Contracting Center, ATTN: CCRC-AF Dave Buennig, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-8000, or electronically to david.buennig@us.army.mil.  Please respond no later than 14-Dec-2010, and identify the 30MM M789/M788 Sources Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<DESC>Chemical Materials Agency (CMA) has the overall mission for the safe and secure storage of chemical material and to safely and quickly destroy/dispose of all chemical warfare and related material, while ensuring the maximum protection for the public, the personnel involved in the destruction effort, and the environment. To support this mission, CMA requires a Non-Stockpile Systems Contractor II (NSSCII) to partner with transporters and commercial waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs) to acquire transport and waste disposal services for NSCMP missions, projects and systems, including but not limited to the following: Pine Bluff Ton Container Decon Facility (PBTCDF), including closure; Mobile Explosive Destruction System Operations; Transportable Detonation Chamber (TDC); and waste from CAIS (Chemical Agent Identification Set) Disposal Operations/SCANS (Single CAIS Assessment and Neutralization System) as contained in umbrella statement of work paragraph 4.1.9 of the basic contract (DAAA09-02-D-0006) and task order 0006.<BR><BR>The purpose of this special notice is to conduct a market survey of interested parties that may have capabilities and past experiences to respond to and comply with the overall objectives and requirements of the above DAAA09-02-D-0006 contract and task order 0006 or submit proposals if a future competitive Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Waste Management Support (NSCM WMS) request for proposal is issued.<BR><BR>The current period of performance (POP) under task order 0006 will expire on 28 Feb 2011. The Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Contracting Center, is planning to process a sole source extension to the overall period of performance to extend from 28 Feb 2011 to 29 Feb 2012 in lieu of issuing a new, competitive follow-on acquisition. This extension is the last extension allowed for this contract IAW DFARS 217.204(e)(i)(C). As described in FAR 6.3021(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in either substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This extension has to be awarded no later than 1 Mar 2011 to prevent a disruption of the ongoing waste services. <BR><BR>Please electronically submit your interest in response to this special notice, and a description of your capabilities and past experiences to perform the above objectives and requirements contained in the basic contract and task order 0006. This description should include details of previous TSDF partnerships and management of Chemical Warfare Materiel (CWM) wastes in accordance with local, state, Federal, and in some instances international treaty requirements. In addition, your description should provide the company name(s) of your prospective Contractor team arrangement. Your response shall be emailed to Mrs. Lisa Digney at address: lisa.m.digney@us.army.mil. As such, the email submission should be as a Word file attachment, Times New Roman (12 pitch), of no more than five (5) pages (11x8.5). Responses are requested no later than 15 Dec 2010.<BR><BR>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all information received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this special notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the planning purpose of determining whether to conduct a follow-on NSCM WMS competitive acquisition.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center is hereby soliciting information about potentialsources for the design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of Inflatable AerodynamicDecelerator (IAD) systems for space vehicle aerocapture, entry, decent and landing forMars and Earth applications. Inflatable aerodynamic decelerators are an enabling technology for delivery large masspayloads for future Mars and Earth missions.  On August 17, 2009, the IRVE-II project(with a 2.96m (116.5in) inflatable aeroshell) was launched on a sounding rocket out ofWallops Flight Facility, with a goal of demonstrating the concept of inflatable reentryvehicles. During the IRVE-II flight, the aeroshell inflated as designed and maintainedstability not only through hypersonic reentry but also through the supersonic, transonicand subsonic flight regimes.  To advance this technology, demonstration of larger scaleIAD inflatables will begin with ground testing and progress to space flightdemonstrations.  The performance of larger scale IADs over the range of flightconditions, performance of thermal protective systems under higher heat flux levels, andresponse to vehicle flight controls will need to be demonstrated.  IAD designs will needto meet specific requirements for aerocapture, entry, descent and landing and may includehypersonic, supersonic, transonic and subsonic regimes to suit the application. Development activities will also include integration with various flight vehicleconfigurations, stowage, deployment, inflation and instrumentation.  The size of IADs ofinterest for this development effort range from 3 meters to 15 meters in diameter.  Acomplete IAD system consists of the inflatable structure, thermal protection system, andrestraint system for stowage.  Interfaces for the IADs include attachment to vehiclecenterbody, inflation system and instrumentation.Sources are being sought for design, analysis, fabrication, integration, testing and testsupport of IADs from 3 meters to 15 meters in diameter that met specific requirements foraerocapture, entry, decent and landing in hypersonic, supersonic, transonic and subsonicregimes to suit application to include, but not limited to the following areas:1.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source: The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) acting on the behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with The Harvard John F. Kennedy School of Government Executive Education. JFKSG offers a course in Strategic Management of Regulatory and Enforcement Agencies (SMREA), specifically focusing on the relationship between strategic planning and how it affects policy, development of regulations and guidance and legislative issues. This course targets managers in regulatory agencies in the field of strategic management. <br />
<p><br />TTB requires a specific training course and curriculum that provides regulatory managers with practical instruction in strategic planning to improve the regulatory and enforcement process for a Federal agency. The training has to cover regulatory and enforcement strategic planning because of TTB's mission and responsibilities. TTB's responsibilities are protecting the public and collecting the revenue. They carry out these responsibilities by developing regulations, conducting product analysis, ensuring tax and trade compliance with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and the Internal Revenue Code through enforcement. TTB also protects the public by enforcing the provisions of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA) to ensure that only qualified persons engage in the alcohol beverage industry. TTB is responsible for enforcing the laws relating to tobacco products; advertising and regulating businesses engaged in alcohol production, and wholesale; regulating businesses engaged in tobacco manufacturing; and the importation and labeling and advertising of alcohol products.</p>
<p>A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available. If no affirmative written response is received, that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Harvard University's John F Kennedy School of Government. Telephone inquires will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Project Title: <br />Positive Train Location (PTL) Proof of Concept (POC) Phase I and Phase II<br /><br />Project Sponsor:<br />This project is sponsored by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) through a Cooperative Agreement with the Railroad Research Foundation (RRF).  The RRF is a nonprofit foundation formed by the Association of American Railroads.  The RRF represents the technology development interests of the North American freight railroad industry, Amtrak, and several other commuter railroads.  The Transportation Technology Center, Inc. (TTCI) is the Prime Subcontractor for the RRF and serves as the Program Office for the project.<br /><br />Background:<br />FRA and the North American railroad industry have been developing various elements for a typical Positive Train Control (PTC) system and have been demonstrating, with system integration, various functions of PTC systems.  However, during these demonstrations, certain limitations in the designs and technology that would negatively affect the operating efficiency and line capacity were revealed. Two of these identified limitations are train length data accuracy and positive determination of train location.  To overcome some of the operation difficulties, these two limitations, among others, have to be corrected or minimized. The PTL system will address these two objectives.
<p>It is anticipated that the PTL system will consist of two GPS-based components, one located on the locomotive and the other at the rear of train. However, other onboard technologies may be used in lieu of or in addition to GPS-based technology to provide the required PTL functionality.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />The main objective of this POC project is the testing and evaluation of location technologies compatible with Interoperable Train Control (ITC)-compliant locomotive onboard PTC systems. Testing will verify whether the selected technology(ies) can provide location of the locomotive and of the rear of the train at the specified accuracy under all conditions including GPS temporary unavailability. Testing will also verify position accuracy at system initialization in single track and multi track territories and during movement of the train through switches and tunnels.</p>
<p>Phase I will address testing of the position algorithm on one train on dedicated track at TTC. Phase II will consist of field testing to prove the PTL functionality and reliability under realistic field conditions and scenarios. Phase II testing and evaluation will address system position algorithm and system environmental requirements on the host railroad's track with locomotives equipped with an ETMS&reg; or V-ETMS&reg;  onboard system. Sufficient locomotives and test time will be dedicated to Phase II to determine whether the PTL system is a commercially viable solution.</p>
<p>If the PTL POC project is successful, railroads may elect to proceed with Phase III which will consist of full integration and manufacturing of the PTL system for ITC-compliant locomotive onboard PTC systems.</p>
<p>Scope:<br />The scope of this project is limited to Phase I and Phase II and to the testing and evaluation of the accuracy of the position algorithm, accuracy of reported speed and direction of movement, and compliance with the physical, environmental, and performance requirements. See attached RFP package file for complete details of the project and requirements for RFP responders.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-46, effective 29 Oct 2010 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <BR><BR>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <BR><BR>FAR provision 52.212-3 and Alt I shall be completed and returned with your quote.  If your company information is available through Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) so indicate in 52.212-3 and return only that portion of the provision.    <BR><BR>FAR Provision 52.252-1 and FAR Clause 52.252-2:  full text language of provisions and clauses incorporated by reference can be located at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.   <BR><BR>FAR Clauses 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.232-18, 52.252-2 and DFARS Clauses 252.204-7003 and 252.212-7001.  <BR><BR>FAR clause 52.212-4 is amended as follows: paragraph (g) (1) change requirement for three copies of invoices to 1 copy of invoices and add after paragraph (g) (2) the following: Invoices are to be in accordance with the Electronic Invoicing Instructions attached to the resulting order.  Questions regarding payment status or delinquent payments are to be addressed to the Voucher Examiner at 434-298-6183; Delete paragraphs (h) Patent indemnity, (j) Risk of loss, and (n) Title.  <BR><BR>The following clauses included in 52.212-5 are applicable: 52.219-28, 52.222-3, 52.222-19, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-36, 52.225-13, 52.232-33, and 52.232-36.  In addition, clauses, 52.222-41, 52.222-42, and 52.222-44 or 52.222-53, included in 52.212-5 may be deemed applicable pending contractors response to paragraph (k)(2) in FAR Provision 52.212-3. The service contract wage determination applicable for the location of the proposed hotel facility will be made a part of any resulting award if FAR clause 52.222-41 is determined to be applicable.   <BR><BR>FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, is applicable as funds are not presently available.  <BR><BR>The following clauses included in 252.212-7001 are applicable: 252.225-7001 and 252.247-7023 Alt III.  <BR><BR>Each offer shall indicate if credit card (VISA) is an acceptable form of payment.  <BR><BR>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to all events, but must bid all services per event.  In determining the most advantageous scenario, the government will evaluate pricing as follows: 1 - Each event will be evaluated separately.  2 - If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging, conference, catering, etc.) for both events and offers the overall lowest price, one award may be made to the one vendor.  3 - An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards.  <BR><BR>For purposes of price evaluation, if there is a mathematical error in which the unit price multiplied by the quantity does not equal the extended total, the unit price will prevail and be used for evaluation and award purposes. In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided.  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rates proposed by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest priced technically acceptable quote.   <BR><BR>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met: (1) The quote must provide for all services which are per event (i.e. lodging, conference space, catering, support equipment, etc.).  (2) The hotel facility must have on-site parking for at least 160 vehicles or if off-site parking, the hotel facility must provide valet services.  (3) The hotel facility must have at least one operating, full service restaurant on site and/or have full service restaurants located within three blocks of the hotel facility. (4) Facilities being proposed for lodging and conference must be located in the geographical areas identified above.  (5) Lodging facility must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost and a conference space accommodations chart must accompany the quote. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (5) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  If the information required is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  A site visit may be conducted by the government if determined necessary to confirm technical proposal findings.  The site visit shall not be considered part of discussions unless discussions are determined necessary. <BR><BR>All questions shall be submitted in writing and received prior to the time and date scheduled for receipt of quotes.  Questions can be sent on or before 5:30 p.m. ET, December 8, 2010, via email, rebecca.fowler@us.army.mil or fax (434) 298-6202. Quotes are due not later than 5:30 p.m. ET, December 10, 2010.

SECTION  1.0__________________________SUMMARY OF WORK
The National Park Service's (NPS) Edison National Historical Site (the "Park"), located at 211 Main Street, Building 5, West Orange, NJ 07052, wishes to purchase and have installed, LED lights in 18 glass-fronted cabinets located in the public hallway of the open storage area in Building 5 at the Laboratory Complex at the address listed above.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Tulbai Abdiev<br />Chief Engineer<br />National Company "Kazakhstan Temir Zholy"<br />#6 Konaev Street<br />010000 Astana<br />Republic of Kazakhstan</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to:</p>
<p>1. Evaluate the current status of KTZ's Rail signaling and train control systems; <br />2. Evaluate current technologies to determine the best fit for KTZ's current and future train control and rail signaling plans;<br />3. Develop technical specifications for updating KTZ's equipment on a system wide or rail corridor by corridor basis; <br />4. Develop cost estimates of the above recommended systems.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan Temir Zholy "Kazakhstan Railways" is engaged in an aggressive plan of railway development. A primary objective of this plan is to improve capacity on major corridors throughout the country, in particular to support domestic export and transit freight traffic growth taking advantage of KTZ's strategic "crossroads" position in Central Asia. In parallel, significant investment is underway and planned to improve and increase railway passenger service as demand for service presently outstrips supply and service quality requires improvement. KTZ anticipates most major lines in the country will continue to carry mixed passenger and freight traffic and they intend to bring peak speeds on main corridors from a present 140 kilometers per hour on main lines up to 160 and ultimately to 200 kilometers per hour. From a control, safety and capacity perspective these goals will be a technical challenge to achieve. Presently the major railway corridors in Kazakhstan are controlled using legacy Soviet Union-era electric automated block signal systems. These systems are outdated, costly to maintain and KTZ has assessed that they will be inefficient to support the capacity needs in accordance with projected future traffic levels and characteristics. The feasibility study will assess rail signaling and train control systems upgrades for three rail corridors on KTZ's railway network that are representative of the entire network.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $655,188 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Please note the following question has been answered.
<p><br />Question: Please provide further information on or a clarification of the following statement in the RFP:"The owner and operator for the proposed WTE plant is presently anticipated to be a joint venture (JV) between IDEA, the Municipality of Envigado, and possibly a private sector engineering firm with which the Grantee has a history of working."</p>
<p>Answer: The only two companies certain to participate in the Project, i.e., IDEA and EVAS Enviambientales, S.A. E.S.P. (EVAS), are regional public enterprises, both of which have a very good reputation at the local and national level in Colombia. As noted in the RFP, EVAS is fully owned by the Municipality of Envigado. Any other companies referenced in the Definitional Mission Report or otherwise suggested in the statement above do not constitute formal participants in the Project and therefore, neither IDEA nor EVAS has any legal obligation with any such company. IDEA currently has an MOU with EVAS for the Project and has not signed any other MOU with any other company, whether it be Colombian or international, for purposes of the Project. Once the feasibility of the Project has been established, the most suitable business structure will be determined. Likewise, at this point IDEA has not agreed to a particular business structure with any Colombian or international company for the development of the Project.</p>

 Award shall be made to the responsive, responsible offeror determined to have the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.  Successful offers must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx) and provide representations and certifications either electronically online (https://orca.bpn.gov/) or in writing by obtaining a written form by request from the Contracting Officer.  

The Service Contract Act may apply to this procurement.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Each offeror shall complete the following certification in accordance with FAR 52.222-52:
The offeror __ does __ does not certify that:
(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; 
(2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; 
(3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and 
(4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act- 
(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or 
(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. 
(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- 
(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and 
(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. 
(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

 Award shall be made to the responsive, responsible offeror determined to have the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.  Successful offers must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx) and provide representations and certifications either electronically online (https://orca.bpn.gov/) or in writing by obtaining a written form by request from the Contracting Officer.  

The Service Contract Act may apply to this procurement.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  Each offeror shall complete the following certification in accordance with FAR 52.222-52:
The offeror __ does __ does not certify that:
(1) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; 
(2) The contract services are furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices. An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; 
(3) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and 
(4) The offeror uses the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the offeror uses for these employees and for equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(d)(3) that the Service Contract Act- 
(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or 
(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at FAR 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offer, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. 
(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- 
(1) The clause of this solicitation at 52.222-53, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; and 
(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. 
(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.

<DESC>TYPE OF ANNOUNCEMENT: Presolicitation Notice for Solicitation FA8629-11-R-2282<br /><br />ADDED: 29 November 2010<br />This is a Notification of Contractual Action (NOCA) Pre-solicitation notice issued in accordance with FAR 5.203. This is not a request for a quote, proposal or an invitation for bid. This acquisition will be a total Small Business set-aside in accordance with FAR 19.502-2. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.219-6 apply. This clause will appear in the solicitation Request for Proposal. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>The work to be performed will be to provide a receiver aircraft with probe/drogue air refueling capability with a C-130 type tanker aircraft. The effort will entail multiple sorties to evaluate the VSD flight characteristics prior, during and after dry aerial refueling. The tanker will utilize the standard Sargent Fletcher wing refueling pod and up to three developmental Variable Speed Drogues(VSD). Contractor shall provide at minimum a 2 seat aircraft with sufficient room in the cockpit for the second crew member to operate photo/test equipment. The receiver aircraft should be able to have government data gathering equipment installed or able to accommodate data gathering equipment to be brought onto the aircraft. Such instrumentation shall be approved by the contractor and the USAF. The contractor shall provide a functional MA-2 flexible tip probe equipped aircraft that is physically compatible with the prototype VSD(s) attached to a MA-2, MA-3 or a MA-3-1coupling. The VSD(s) are approximately 50 inches in diameter and 25 inches in depth(measured from the coupling latch point to the center of the perpendicular plane across the trailing edge of the drogue). The Aircraft shall support VSD testing throughout the CV-22 refueling envelope (150-210 KEAS) at altitudes from 3000-20000 ft MSL. The contractor shall also provide highly qualified pilots current in aerial refueling, and necessary ground support to complete a surrogate receiver test effort. For purposes of this contract, aerial refueling currency is defined as "at least one probe/drogue receiver contact within the 90 day period prior to the first scheduled receiver test sortie." The contractor needs to have a facility to support a C-130 aircraft or be able to deploy their aircraft to Elgin AFB, FL for approximately one week. A site visit may be scheduled prior contract award.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is issuing&nbsp;a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-NIMH-10-024 entitled <strong>"Rapidly-Acting Treatments for Treatment-Resistant Depression (RAPID)"</strong> under Full and Open Competition.<br /><br />This is a Research and Development initiative which is anticipated to leverage the development of rapid treatments (demonstrable clinical improvement within 72 hours of administration) for severe, treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />1. The primary objectives of resultant contract(s) are:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To establish a network of sites to study "Rapidly-Acting Treatments for Depression" (i.e. the "RAPID-network") that will focus on identifying and testing promising interventions (pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological) that produce a substantial anti-depressant effect within 72 hours of initial administration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. To perform randomized clinical trials testing such promising interventions (other than Ketamine Hydrochloride or sleep deprivation (total or partial)) in a well-characterizedcohort of adult patients (age 18-60) diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />2. A secondary objective of resultant contract(s) would be:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. To further study and evaluate interventions that showed efficacy in a RAPID-network Proof of Concept trial in a larger clinical trial.<br /><br />Important Considerations:<br /><br />1. The Contractor(s) are responsible for identifying, recommending, and accessing (if a 3rd party is involved) all interventions to be tested during the contract period.<br /><br />2. In order to be competitive for an award, Offerors should propose, with the initial offer, a trial of promising intervention with a detailed protocol that the network would be capable of initiating without delay after the infrastructure is established and after gaining all regulatory approvals. <br /><br />3. The Contractor(s) should either already have access to and permission to develop the intervention (from a 3rd party supplier, if applicable), or provide evidence that there would not be delay involved in conducting the 1st trial due to access problems.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; The peer reviewed evaluation of the scientific merit of the 1st recommended intervention, and access to develop that intervention, will be an important factor in determining which Offerors may be awarded a contract. <br /><br />The Offeror should also have the capability to:<br /><br />1. Perform clinical trials of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in treatment-resistant depression specifically.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; Provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, data acquisition, bio-statistical data analysis and reporting of results from clinical trials involving subjects with treatment-resistant depression.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; Collaborate with multiple experts and stakeholders (investigators, clinicians, advocates, and consumers) in treatment-resistant depression research. <br /><br />General Information:<br /><br />This RFP, HHS-NIH-NIMH-10-024, details the specifics of the project as well as information pertinent to the development of an Offeror's proposal.<br /><br />The&nbsp;solicitation document&nbsp;may be accessed through the Internet at the Federal Business Opportunities website at: <a href="http://www.fedbizopps.gov">http://www.fedbizopps.gov</a>.&nbsp; No paper copies will be available.&nbsp; Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments that may be issued by the Government.&nbsp; Proposals will be due <strong>on or about January 13, 2011.</strong>&nbsp; It is anticipated that one or more cost-reimbursement contract awards will be made for a period of five years beginning on or about June 30, 2011.&nbsp; Contract(s) will be Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) and the number of interventions to be tested over the contract period is indefinite beyond the 1st intervention.&nbsp; <br /><br />This modification/amendment to the Pre-solicitation notice HHSNIHNIMH10024 corresponds to the Small Business Sources Sought notice: #HHS-NIMH-SBSS-10-001 previously posted on August 11, 2010 and Research and Development Sources Sought notice#: HHSNIHNIMHRDSS10024 posted on September 16, 2010. <br /><br />All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal that will be considered by the NIMH.&nbsp; This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.<br /><br />Please contact Marla Jacobson, Contract Specialist at <a href="mailto:jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov">jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov</a> for further information.&nbsp; All questions must be submitted in writing to <a href="mailto:jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov">jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions posed by interested parties.  
1)	VA has multiple medical facilities in the current 50 states and territories. A current article stated 153 facilities are being looked at. Will this project be a Veteran Set-aside based on RFI responses?  
ANSWER:  This information is not known at this time and will be determined later in the acquisition process. 
2)	Will a listing of the states be provided at this time? 
ANSWER:  A listing of all Medical Facilities is not available at this time.  
3)	Why does the VA require cellular internet service over a Wi-Fi service?
ANSWER:   The RFI makes note of both Wi-Fi and 3G, the potential exists that certain facility areas will not be structurally capable of supporting wireless access points, therefore the medical center management may deem the coverage essential enough that cellular service may be requested as an alternative.
4)	Will the VA consider Wi-Fi infrastructure as a wireless internet solution? 
ANSWER:  Yes
5)	Will a GSA schedule be required for VGIA project? 
ANSWER:  This information is not known at this time and will be determined later in the acquisition process.
6)	What is the uplink and downlink Megabytes per second (Mbps) requirement?   
ANSWER:  The requirements are listed.  We are not specifically requiring network speed minimums or maximums.
7)	Will each facility require service for each in room patients only or will there be a requirement for general facility areas, i.e. hallways, lobbies, waiting rooms, staff offices, etc.
 ANSWER:  This depends on the specific facility, but there is a potential for all of the above.
8)	What are the IP security requirements?  
ANSWER:  The security requirements are listed in the Draft Technical Requirements which were posted as an amendment to this RFI.  
9)	Does the VA require a call center setup with 24 x 7, 365 days out of the year service? 
ANSWER:  For IT staff access only.  
10)	We believe the NAICs Code for this RFI should be 517110 rather than the published 517210. The VA's chief information officer has been quoted as saying that broadband cellular wireless should be used as an alternative to Wi-Fi. Which service provider is best suited for the VA at this time? 
ANSWER:  Thank you for the NAICS code suggestion.  We will look into this.  
11)	Is there a preference between, GSM, UMTS , EVDO, HSDPA, WiMax,  or other third generation (3G) or pre-fourth generation (LTE) technology ? 
ANSWER:  No
12)	Is there an estimate of the number of users per facility that includes the number of bed patients and facility personnel? 
ANSWER:  Not at this time. This number would be dependent on the facility.  
13)	In the event of a power outage, are each of the facilities equipped with a redundant power supply or will an alternative power source be required, i.e. Solar, UPS, etc?  
ANSWER:  Yes
14)	Does this RFI include a DSL or Cable provider for providing the internet service?  
ANSWER:  No
15)	Will laptop computers or other type of internet capable infrastructure be required, i.e. Google TV?  
ANSWER:  No
16)	Will the VA consider a 3-5 day extension for this RFI response? 
ANSWER:  The RFI response date was extended to December 7, 2010 via an amendment that was posted to FBO.  
17)	Will this be a multi-award or single award?  
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time.  We are in the planning stages of the process and assessing the market with this RFI.  
18)	How many of the medical facilities are considered rural?  
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time.
19)	Will there be any limiting requirements regarding cellular frequencies being used in a hospital environment (i.e., commercial service radio frequencies versus MRI, CT Scanners, other medical devices)?   
ANSWER:  This information is unknown at this time, but there is potential for the above to exist.  
20)  We would like to understand if the VA is interested in implementing completely separate wireless access points and network infrastructure to support guest access, or if a separate SSID and security settings should be used on the existing wireless AP and controllers? Using the existing equipment would be as secure, and would be much more cost effective.
ANSWER:  VA is interested in a completely separate wireless access points and network infrastructure to support guest access.
21)  Please explain the need for PCI compliance requirements, if this network will be a separate network from the hospital operational WLAN network?
ANSWER:  From the PCI Compliance Guide, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that ALL companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.  Essentially any merchant that has a Merchant ID (MID).
The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) was launched on September 7, 2006 to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards with focus on improving payment account security throughout the transaction process.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>The United States Army Military Police School has made the decision that the TASER International Corporation will be the only authorized supplier of non-lethal pistols to the Military Police Corps, Army wide.  The Inter-Service Non-Lethal Individual Weapons (INIWIC) Instructor Course at Fort Leonard Wood trains and certifies Soldiers on the TASER X26E and has established it as the standard for non-lethal pistols utilized within the MP Corps.<BR><BR>This sole source action will prevent duplication of costs in that it will provide for a unified system of equipment.  Furthermore, to give this contract to another vendor would create a situation in which two different products are being utilized.  This would incur further re-training and re-certification of current non-lethal instructors to incorporate the new non-lethal weapon system.  For example, the battalion currently has 2 Taser X26E units that it services and orders parts for.  To award this contract to another vendor would result in duplication of repair and replacement part costs.

<MODNBR>P00061
<ARCHDATE>12292010
<DESC>The purpose of this extension is to provide multi-functional CONUS Support Base Services (CSBS) in support of Fort McCoy, Wisconsin.  This is a request for an additional one month extension to the 4th option year of the current contract. The justification for this request is as follows. On 1 August 2009, Ft. McCoy submitted all required contracting documentation to initiate a new CSBS Contract for a base year and four option years with a start date of 1 July, 2010, however the decision has been made recently by 1st Army for Ft. McCoy mission change starting approximately 1 October 2011. This status change negates the need for a new 5 year CSBS contract.  An additional one month extension to the current 5 month contract extension is required for an uninterrupted flow of MOB related work in support of the Ft McCoy Installation Commanders MOB mission and to allow time for MICC to complete a revised plan to support the future requirement. Due to the short suspense it would be impossible to source a substitute work force to support the continuous MOB mission at Ft McCoy. It would also be impossible to support this requirement with the current Ft McCoy government staff.  Any attempt to implement a temporary replacement contractor for one month would result in additional and unnecessary costs to the government.
