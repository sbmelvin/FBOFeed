<p>This is a pre-solicitation synopsis. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Medium Altitude UAS Division, AFLCMC/WIIK, intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI). This effort will be for the procurement and production of 8 Block 30 Ground Control Stations (GCS) and 3 Block 25 Dual Control Module Ground Control Stations (DCMGCS). GA-ASI is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the Predator and Reaper systems and is the only firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience and technical data required to perform these efforts. The Government does not own the data rights for the system; therefore, to avoid duplication costs, the Government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit appropriate information to Bill Grahame at (858) 312-4392, or bill.grahame@uav.com at GA-ASI.

Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>

NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP). This will be a new requirement. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed price and will have a period of performance of thirty-six (36) months. The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about June 2, 2014. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.
<p>The CDC/NCHHSTP is seeking technical assistance from an offeror with expertise in designing and conducting clinical vaccine trials among older adults to assess the immune response to hepatitis A vaccine in accordance with possible use for post-exposure prophylaxis. The offeror will conduct a clinical trial with approval by the CDC and local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and in compliance with IRB protocol and other appropriate HHS/CDC requirements for scientific research.</p>
<p>Data are lacking on the effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis among adults 40 years and older. The results of this study will inform development of updated U.S. post-exposure prophylaxis recommendations affecting adults &gt; 40 years of age. The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations state that for persons aged &gt; 40 years, immunoglobulin (IG) is preferred; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. Hepatitis A vaccine generally is more readily available than IG for immediate use after exposure. Hepatitis A vaccination has the advantage over IG of inducing long-term protection and potential individual benefits, such as knowledge of protection against future exposures.</p>
<p>The primary objective is to determine the immunogenicity and safety of hepatitis A vaccination among healthy susceptible adults age &ge; 40 years by decade of life in comparison to a control group of healthy susceptible adults age 30-39 years.<br /><br />Eligible offerors must have the access and capability to conduct research in a clinical setting, including appropriate confidentiality and protection of human subject assurances, and demonstrated experience with applying for and receiving local IRB approval for clinical trials. Eligible offerors will recruit subjects, determine eligibility of subjects, obtain blood samples, perform vaccinations, monitor safety, send aliquoted blood samples to the CDC Hepatitis Reference Laboratory for analysis, inform subjects of the results or laboratory testing, and document immunogenicity.</p>
<p>CDC has the following objectives:</p>
<p>1) To write a protocol consistent with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines for conducting clinical research for a vaccine trial, and that will meet local and federal requirements for IRB approval. <br />2) To recruit an appropriate study population for the trial as specified in the performance work statement, including obtaining informed consent and collecting a medical history.<br />3) To collect and properly store blood samples (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HEV/PDFs/HRL_PCRSampleHndlgShpg_20080615.pdf), and ensure privacy and confidentiality; properly store vaccines (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/vac-storage.pdf).<br />4) To have laboratory capabilities to conduct laboratory tests for antibody titers, serology, and liver function. <br />5) To provide clinical staff who meet legal and licensure qualifications ensuring the ability to administer vaccine.<br />6) Demonstrated experience to perform scientific data analysis and prepare manuscripts for peer reviewed scientific journals.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipment, as appropriate to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in the statement of work.</p>

If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.
<p>The CDC/NCHHSTP is seeking technical assistance from an offeror with expertise in designing and conducting clinical vaccine trials among older adults to assess the immune response to hepatitis A vaccine in accordance with possible use for post-exposure prophylaxis. The offeror will conduct a clinical trial with approval by the CDC and local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and in compliance with IRB protocol and other appropriate HHS/CDC requirements for scientific research.</p>
<p>Data are lacking on the effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis among adults 40 years and older. The results of this study will inform development of updated U.S. post-exposure prophylaxis recommendations affecting adults &gt; 40 years of age. The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations state that for persons aged &gt; 40 years, immunoglobulin (IG) is preferred; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. Hepatitis A vaccine generally is more readily available than IG for immediate use after exposure. Hepatitis A vaccination has the advantage over IG of inducing long-term protection and potential individual benefits, such as knowledge of protection against future exposures.</p>
<p>The primary objective is to determine the immunogenicity and safety of hepatitis A vaccination among healthy susceptible adults age &ge; 40 years by decade of life in comparison to a control group of healthy susceptible adults age 30-39 years.</p>
<p>Eligible offerors must have the access and capability to conduct research in a clinical setting, including appropriate confidentiality and protection of human subject assurances, and demonstrated experience with applying for and receiving local IRB approval for clinical trials. Eligible offerors will recruit subjects, determine eligibility of subjects, obtain blood samples, perform vaccinations, monitor safety, send aliquoted blood samples to the CDC Hepatitis Reference Laboratory for analysis, inform subjects of the results or laboratory testing, and document immunogenicity.</p>
<p>CDC has the following objectives:</p>
<p>1) To write a protocol consistent with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines for conducting clinical research for a vaccine trial, and that will meet local and federal requirements for IRB approval. <br />2) To recruit an appropriate study population for the trial as specified in the performance work statement, including obtaining informed consent and collecting a medical history.<br />3) To collect and properly store blood samples (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HEV/PDFs/HRL_PCRSampleHndlgShpg_20080615.pdf), and ensure privacy and confidentiality; properly store vaccines (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/vac-storage.pdf).<br />4) To have laboratory capabilities to conduct laboratory tests for antibody titers, serology, and liver function. <br />5) To provide clinical staff who meet legal and licensure qualifications ensuring the ability to administer vaccine.<br />6) Demonstrated experience to perform scientific data analysis and prepare manuscripts for peer reviewed scientific journals.</p>
<p>The offeror shall furnish all the necessary personnel, facilities, supplies, equipment, as appropriate to provide CDC with the required scientific, technical, and operational services, within the general work parameters set forth in the statement of work.</p>

<DESC>*** If you are viewing this announcement on any other site, except the FAA Contracting Opportunities website, please go to https://faaco.faa.gov to view it in its entirety with attachments.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) may have an upcoming requirement for the supply of office supplies in the categories of Basic Office Essentials and PC Accessories (see attached document for detailed descriptions of both categories). This requirement may support the entire FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT).  The areas of service coverage are both CONUS and OCONUS.

Attachment I entitled, Scope for Office Essentials and PC Accessories is included for informational purposes only to outline the broad scope of the envisioned work.  

This market survey is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small business concerns.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of capabilities from interested parties who are Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDB/8(a)), Small Businesses, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the requirement among small business concerns.  Responses from large business will not be considered at this time.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes anticipated for this effort is 322230, Stationery Product Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees and 453210 Office Supplies and Stationery Stores with a small business size standard of $30 Million. A Secondary NAICS code that may be considered for this effort is 424120, Stationary and Office Supplies Merchant Wholesalers, with a small business size standard of 100 employees.  A wholesale trade or retail trade business submitting a capability statement on a supply acquisition is categorized as a non-manufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of 13 CFR 121.406. 

In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO PAGE LIMITATION, HOWEVER SUBMISSIONS SHOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT CONCISE INFORMATION ONLY.


Capability Statement  This document should identify:

1. Your companys capability to provide supplies and services to the agency as described by Attachment I, Requirements, including geographical areas where your company can provide services.

2. Any relevant current or previous experience that includes not more than three contacts for the same or similar services completed within the last five years or still ongoing.

Additional Submissions

1. Completed Business Declaration Form, and any SBA certification letters (if applicable)

2. Comments concerning the Market Survey are welcome and optional.  

The FAA will consider all comments received.
All submissions in response to this market survey must be received by 12:00 pm EST on June 3, 2014.  Send response via email to elizabeth.ford@faa.gov.  Phone calls regarding this survey will not be entertained.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for an Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) prototype system to assist with a test measuring void fraction and velocity profiles during two-phase flow separation. <P> NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from TECH 4 IMAGING, 4171 Fairfax Dr., Columbus, OH 43220-4524.	They are the designer and manufacturer of this system. <P> Tech4Imaging is providing a prototype system with custom sensors and is assisting with a custom test for the NASA Glenn Research Center. The Electrical Capacitance Volume Tomography (ECVT) prototype system is needed to provide a 3D representation of phase concentrations within a custom made test section. The measurements from the ECVT system need to provide: (1) the volume fraction profile over a time history, especially during transient testing, (2) information about the gas core, and (3) the local void fraction (radial distribution) in the liquid layer. The ECVT system also needs to provide the velocity profile in the axial and angular directions. To NASA's knowledge, there are currently no commercial off-the-shelf instruments capable of providing these measurements other than electrical capacitance volume tomography (ECVT) system developed by Tech4Imaging of Columbus, Ohio.  <P> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. <P> The Sole Source is under the authority of FAR reference 13.106-1(b)1. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 5/19/2014.

<p>Pre-Proposal Conference: TBD</p>
<p>This combined sources sought/synopsis is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. A contract may not be awarded as a result of this sources sought/synopsis. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ), intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Requirements Fixed Unit Price contract for this effort using FAR Part 15 procedures. Services to be procured include contractor support, GPS ankle bracelets and a tracking/monitoring system, telephonic reporting voice recognition / verification system and a case management system with the ability to monitor from enrollment to termination from ISAP III. The Contractor will need to use PACER and any other relevant public systems to ascertain each Participant's status with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), and make the appropriate updates and adjustments in their database for tracking and reporting purposes</p>
<p>ISAP III is a core community-based supervision and in-person reporting program designed to provide cost-effective electronic monitoring supervision and case management for individuals who are not subject to mandatory detention but have been determined to require a higher level of monitoring than being released on recognizance or with bond conditions alone. These individuals may be at any stage in the Immigration Court system. Activities of aliens released from ICE custody and placed in the program (i.e. participants) may be monitored by case specialists (i.e. contractors) or directly by the ICE officers themselves. Aliens participating in this alternative program must comply with a variety of activities and reporting requirements designed to successfully reintegrate the alien into his or her community while navigating the immigration process from initial of proceedings through departure. Program requirements for compliance include, but are not limited to: unannounced home visits, scheduled office visits, electronic monitoring, and submission of a valid travel document. To ensure successful outcomes, the program relies on Electronic Monitoring (EM) devices, telephonic reporting and unannounced home visits. Participants must also report to their assigned ISAP office regularly for face-to-face interviews.</p>
<p>FAR 4.11 System for Award Management requires that all prospective contractors doing business with the Department of Homeland Security be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). SAM may be accessed at http://www.sam.gov/. Offerors must have a DUNs Number or have the ability to obtain one prior to proposal submittal. The entire solicitation will be issued electronically at the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website: https://www.fbo.gov/ Paper copies will not be available. The solicitation, attachments, and specifications will only be available by downloading the documents from the FedBizOpps website. All prospective offerors are responsible for obtaining the solicitation, any amendments or any other information from the FedBizOpps website. It is therefore the offeror's responsibility to check the website for any posted changes to the solicitation. The projected solicitation issue date is May 27, 2014. Please note that the issue date of the solicitation is estimated and may be changed without notice. When issued, the solicitation will specify the actual date and time for proposal receipt as well as a due date for the submission of any questions related to this effort. No telephone calls will be accepted. Please note the email addresses at the top of this notice. No other synopsis will be posted for this requirement</p>

Jackson VAMC provides primary, second and tertiary medical, neurological and mental health inpatient care. Services include hemodialysis, sleep studies, substance abuse treatment, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hematology/oncology, and rehabilitation programs. Both primary and specialized outpatient services are available, including such specialized programs
as: ambulatory surgery, spinal cord injury, neurology, infectious disease, substance abuse, PTSD, readjustment counseling, and mental health diagnostic and treatment programs. Comprehensive health care is available for female veteran patients. An 86-bed Community Living Center (including a palliative care unit), community nursing homes, three 150-bed state veterans nursing homes, VA community clinics, and a variety of outpatient programs are utilized to support the needs of aging veterans.

This medical center is the Clinic of Jurisdiction for the State of Mississippi and provides administrative support to the South Central VA Healthcare Network (VISN 16), the Veterans Outreach Center, the Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office, and the National Cemetery in Natchez.
Effective, accurate, and timely budgetary planning and management support is essential to the operations of VISN 16.  Due to turnover in key positions, the current resource management staff within the Network has a lack of VA-specific experience.  VISN 16 leadership has identified an opportunity to address this risk and enhance the proficiency and effectiveness of the staff through the assistance of a contractor with extensive VA-specific management and consulting expertise
to improve the organization's performance with strategic resource planning and meeting mission goals as they relate to resource management.


Project Scope
VHA seeks expert technical assistance in support of the Chief Financial Officer and senior Financial Management staff at the Jackson VAMC.  Specifically, Jackson VAMC requests consultative services from experienced management, facilitation, and coaching professionals to provide expert advisory, process, and mentoring support.   The technical advisor must provide the following services:
o	Assist Jackson VAMC senior management team with development of strategic resource plans.
o	Review and provide suggestions regarding oversight processes for studies, analyses, scenarios, and reports relating to the organization's strategic and resource planning programs.
o	Provide expert feedback to the network resource management staff on the technical execution of the planning processes.
o	Work with facility managerial staff to develop a consolidated reporting system to provide adequate oversight and analysis of resource program planning.
o	Provide recommendations on potential performance improvement measures.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to mount onto the P-8A 100 pounds of support structure and equipment within the Electronic Support Measures (ESM) radome aft of the scanner antenna. It is assumed positive margins can be shown without changes to the existing P-8A structure with the exception for new interface holes. NAVAIR's preferred approach is to cantilever the point load off the ESM support structure. If this max load is insufficient, NAVAIR will want to consider attaching to structure farther aft within the ESM radome footprint. NAVAIR intends to issue a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-11-G-0001 to The Boeing Company (Boeing), 7755 East Marginal Way, Seattle, WA 98124-2499, on a sole source basis.
<p>Under the planned order, Boeing shall provide: (1) the max allowable loads at the new antenna support at each interface fastener location; (2) the ESM support structure as Initial Graphics Exchange Specification data and define a &lsquo;stay-in' envelope; and (3) dimensional data, consultation and guidance to NAVAIR's interface detailed design effort. NAVAIR will provide the final interface design to Boeing for Boeing's substantiation of the P-8A structure. Additionally, Boeing shall: (1) calculate the max loading at the interface locations; (2) design for two bulkhead feed-thru connectors and penetration of the pressure vessel (the penetrations will be similar to existing ESM multi-port connectors); (3) provide recommendations to NAVAIR to determine the best location for these penetrations; and (4) provide structural and fatigue analysis of the P-8A structure (to include the ESM support structure), substantiating the max interface loads with sufficient documentation and justification for NAVAIR to obtain an Interim Flight Clearance.</p>
<p>The planned period of performance of this effort is 45 days within the July 2014 through August 2014 timeframe. This contract action requires expertise in P-8A engineering, integration, and testing. The planned sole source order is in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to the requirement. Any interested party must have the knowledge, expertise, facilities, and qualified personnel necessary to accomplish this effort within schedule requirements. Any respondent must also submit a Statement of Qualifications to demonstrate respondent's ability to perform to the Government's needs within the required response time.

<CONTACT>Neil C. Santos, Phone 4018324827, Email neil.santos@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, R.I. intends to award a five year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) type contract with firm fixed pricing to L3 Communications-Electron Technologies, Inc. for the fabrication, test and delivery of L3 Q Band TWT Amplifier Module part number 8905HP-I and the test, inspection and evaluation (TI&amp;E) of returned Q Band TWT Amplifier Modules. Statutory Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1). One Responsible Source. It is anticipated that a minimum of 1 and up to a maximum of 15 Q Band TWT Amplifier Modules may be ordered in a given year. The NAICS is 334419; size standard is 500 Employees. <br />
<p>The Amplifier Radio Frequency Q-Band Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) is a vital part of the SubHDR Antenna System. The SubHDR Antenna System provides high capacity communications to submarines in the Super High Frequency (SHF) and Extremely High Frequency (EHF) spectrums. The system consists of both the inboard Navy Satellite Program (NESP) terminal, and associated equipment and outboard (antenna) components. L3 Communications-Electron Technologies, Inc. is the sole developer and manufacturer of the Q Band TWT Amplifier Module utilized in the SubHDR Antenna System and the manufacturer of all internal components of the Q Band TWT Amplifier Module. Because the Q Band TWT Amplifier Module part number 8905HP-I is a proprietary item of L3 Communications-Electron Technologies, INC, and the Navy did not purchase the design or Technical data Package or drawing rights for part # 8905HP-I, a second source would have to develop its own Q Band TWT Amplifier Module which would result in additional costs and unacceptable schedule impacts to the Government. As such, L3 Communications-Electron Technologies, Inc. is the only source who possesses the knowledge and expertise required to Test, Inspect, and Evaluate failed units and to manufacture the specified replacement Q Band TWT Amplifier Module without substantial duplication of cost and unacceptable schedule impact.</p>
<p>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, R.I. will make available for release a new performance specification and outline drawing (via Compact Disc) for the Q Band TWT Amplifier Module part number 8905HP-I that may enable other sources to bid on future Navy requirements. Please note that the specifications associated with this procurement will only be available by requesting a compact disc from the negotiator (Neil Santos, e-mail: neil.santos@navy.mil Only those vendors who have an active Joint Certification Program (JCP) registration will be provided the compact disc. Please visit http://www/dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for further details on the program and registration. Please provide your company name, address, JCP number, CAGE Code, telephone number, point of contact, as well as a FedEx Account ID number. If there is no FedEx number, specifications will be sent via regular mail. Specifications will be sent once JCP registration is confirmed.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for materials and services for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Offerors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/) to be eligible for award. Instructions for registration are available at the website.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any subsequent amendments will be posted to the FEDBIZOPPS.gov website. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation from this website and for monitoring the site for any amendments.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with the Dr. Ronald Henry for the procurement of Source area identification and temporal change estimated through inverse modeling of near-port measurements. Specific tasks and deliverables of this requirement are as follows:
-  The contractor shall provide the EPA with written document articulating the proposed data analysis approach which will address the following key research questions: What is the port-area contribution air pollutant concentrations measured at the Region 2 Port-area Investigation of Emissions Reduction (R2PIER) station?  What are the detected emission changes at the port over time?  Complicating factors and ancillary data should be considered, such as accounting for regional background which may vary with time/wind direction and changing traffic patterns at the port.  
-  The contractor shall provide EPA a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP). 
-  The contractor shall provide initial model simulations and advanced time series analysis of the real-time pollutant measures (black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NO, NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)) addressing the key research questions in the form of PowerPoint presentation slides, using available quality assured field data collected to date.
-  The contractor shall provide a draft final report, including model simulations and ancillary data analysis of the final quality assured data set (estimated available in December 2014), addressing the key research questions.  
-  The contractor shall also provide clearly commented computer code (MATLAB or R) for each model simulation run or time series analysis as documentation.  
EPA has identified the Dr. Ronald Henry as being uniquely qualified to provide these services to the U.S. EPA based upon the following: The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability of non-parametric trajectory analysis (NTA) model algorithm development and application.  As the NTA model was developed by a particular individual, Dr. Henry is the only known source with the unique expertise able to satisfy the Government's requirements which involve model customization and application.  Several publications documenting the unique expertise of Dr. Henry are listed below:  Henry, R.C., Vette, A., Norris, G., Vedantham, R., Kimbrough, S., Shores, R.C., 2011.  Separating the air quality impact of a major highway and nearby sources by nonparametric trajectory analysis.  Environmental Science & Technology, 45, pp 10471-10476. Henry, R.C., Chang, Y.S., Spiegelman, C.H., 2002. Locating nearby sources of air pollution by nonparametric regression of atmospheric concentrations on wind direction.  Atmospheric Environment, 36, pp 2237- 2244.   Yu, K.N., Cheung, Y.P., Cheung, T., Henry, R.C., 2004. Identifying the impact of large urban airports on local air quality by nonparametric regression, 2004. Atmospheric Environment. 38, pp 4501-4507.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Samantha Fuchs at the address shown above or email at Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

The purpose of this Purchase Order is to obtain analysis of chromium speciation (distribution of hexavalent and trivalent chromium) and chromium reduction capacity in core samples from the Garfield Chromium Ground Water Superfund Site.
Specific tasks and deliverables of this requirement are as follows: 
1)  The contractor shall provide a written description of batch testing procedures used on solid core materials for evaluation of chromium speciation, the laboratory procedure for determining the Cr(VI) reduction capacity of the bedrock matrix, and the procedure for determining Cr(VI) in bedrock matrix porewater. The written procedures shall include, but may not be limited to: material handling (i.e., procedures utilized to minimize atmospheric contact), laboratory batch experimentation variables such as preparation of extraction solutions and solid mass to liquid ratios, extraction times and conditions, and analytical procedures. The written procedures shall include presentation of Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) requirements and applicable QA/QC criteria for all analytical measurements and procedures. The written description of procedures shall be provided to US EPA for review prior to proceeding to the following tasks.
2)  The contractor shall conduct batch tests on rock samples from the Garfield site to assess the Cr(VI) reduction capacity of the bedrock matrix (up to 50 samples).
3)  The contractor shall determine Cr(VI) porewater concentrations in archived bedrock matrix samples (up to 100 samples).
4)  The contractor may, but is not required, to correlate results with measurements of solid-phase chromium speciation determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  The contractor shall provide all core materials to US EPA required for these spectroscopic measurements. Applicable QA/QC requirements for these data will be handled by US EPA and are not the responsibility of the contractor.
5)  The contractor may investigate potential to obtain analyses of chromium isotope ratios in groundwater.
6)  The contractor shall prepare a final written report.
EPA has identified the University of New Brunswick as being uniquely qualified to provide these services to the U.S. EPA based upon the following:
Hexavalent chromium is the primary contaminant at the Garfield site (http://www.epa.gov/region2/superfund/removal/garfield/) in New Jersey. A matrix diffusion study was conducted as part of the remedial investigation to assess the Cr(VI) distribution in the bedrock matrix using methodologies developed by Dr. Beth Parker and team (University of Guelph and University of New Brunswick). The Guelph/New Brunswick team collected continuous cores in April 2012 at a mid-plume location from 70 to 355 feet below ground surface and a total of 400 rock core samples were collected, vacuum sealed and shipped to the University of New Brunswick for storage and analysis. A multilevel well was installed in the same borehole allowing comparison of discrete-depth groundwater samples with the matrix porewater data. In addition, analysis of chromium speciation in the rock samples required laboratory development of new methods for extraction and analysis of Cr(VI) in bedrock because detection limit s were too high with existing techniques (e.g., EPA 3060A). This method development was conducted by Dr. Tom Al and a post-doctoral fellow (Dr. Jiujiang Zhao) in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of New Brunswick. Access to the core samples and to the new methods developed by Dr. Tom Al is not possible without collaboration.
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered by the agency MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Samantha Fuchs at the address shown above or email at Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>&nbsp; This is a RFI notice only. This RFI is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with FAR Part 10.
<p>The 99th Contracting Squadron is seeking market information from qualified, experienced and interested contractors who can perform tasks in support of the 414th Combat Training Squadron. This support shall cover all training and testing operations which utilize the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS)/Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) and operations with the Combined Air Operations Center? Nellis (CAOC-N). These operations include but are not limited to RED FLAG (RF) exercises, USAF Weapons School Mission Employment (ME) phase, Joint Expeditionary Forces Experiment (JEFX), ANGEL THUNDER and other special training/testing missions. RF exercises, conducted at Nellis AFB, NV, provide Large Force Exercise (LFE) advanced tactical training for multinational forces. RF exercises are typically conducted five times per year, are two weeks long, contain two missions per day (normally one day and one night "go") and comprise 500 to 1500 sorties. For both exercises, separate morning, afternoon and nighttime operations may be conducted during any particular period. An Air Tasking Order (ATO) is published for each exercise day that directs the missions, objectives and targets for each unit as part of the integrated force. During execution, mission data is transmitted live and recorded from exercise aircraft/equipment, and received/processed by the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) computer systems for real-time mission control and use in mission debriefings. Recorded data will require post-mission merging. Post-mission, the contractor will generate several aircrew debriefing products to include: graphic flight path tracks for each aircraft; weapons employment "shot" evaluations (air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-to-air shot and Electronic Warfare (EW)); survivability analysis; aggressor tactics and other related data. In support of these exercises, the 68th Electronic Warfare Squadron (68 EWS) at Eglin AFB, FL is tasked by Air Combat Command (ACC) through the USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC) to be the focal point to manage EW training, testing, tactics development and engineering. The 68 EWS provides specialized expertise and assistance in conducting EW/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) operations during composite force training exercises at Nellis AFB, NV. During each exercise the contractor shall support aircrew package debriefs (normally two to three) and a mass aircrew debrief for every mission. Debrief data for both RF and other exercises will be input into and maintained in a database to allow analysis of aggregate historical data concerning the capabilities and strategies utilized in tactical air operations. The contractor shall provide data retrievals as requested by the 414 CTS staff to support any requests within the scope of the contract.</p>

<SOLNBR>RCS-4-42326

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE # RCS-4-42326</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"INTEGRATE: Integrated Network Testbed for Energy Grid Research and Technology Experimentation"</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is seeking sources to address grid integration barriers and opportunities associated with variable energy resources, distributed renewable energy generators, electric vehicle charging, and building efficiency and controls. This includes "grid responsive" building technologies, behind-the meter storage technologies, and solid-state power electronics. In addition, insights from industry and others are needed to enable these devices to meet communication and control protocols to interface and transact at the lowest cost possible while maintaining or improving grid reliability.</p>
<p>NREL anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) that will focus on characterizing the ability of distributed assets to increase the hosting capacity of the grid and provide grid services, investigate new open-source interoperability platforms, and investigate and demonstrate how clean energy technologies can work together holistically to provide grid services and increase the hosting capacity of these technologies on the grid. It is intended that testing and validation activities will be conducted at the Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) at NREL.</p>
<p>NREL anticipates that approximately $6.5 million will be awarded under the planned RFP. Offerors will be required to cost share a minimum contractor contribution of 50% of the total allowable project costs (i.e. the contractor must agree to absorb a minimum of 50% of the total subcontract costs).</p>
<p><br />OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of the INTEGRATE (Integrated Network Testbed for Energy Grid Research and Technology Experimentation) program is to enable energy efficiency, renewable power, and sustainable transportation technologies to increase the hosting capacity of the grid by providing grid services in a holistic manner using an open source, interoperable platform. This will increase the viability and deployment of renewable energy technologies and increase the reliability and efficiency of electricity generation, delivery, and use. The INTEGRATE project will 1) physically characterize a variety of clean energy technologies to provide grid services, 2) implement and evaluate an open communications, information exchange, control, and computation platform, and 3) evaluate integrated solutions for providing services.</p>
<p><br />POTENTIAL TOPIC AREAS</p>
<p>Through this planned RFP, NREL intends to support development and validation of technologies under three topics:</p>
<p>Topic Area 1: Connected Devices</p>
<p>Topic Area 1 of INTEGRATE aims to characterize the performance of existing devices (i.e. solar, vehicles, buildings, fuel cell technologies and wind turbines) to provide grid services that help the grid maintain operational stability. Characteristics of these services that must be measured include response times, ramp rates, and minimum and maximum up times. All of that information is necessary to characterize the component characteristics in electricity market models to estimate the value they can provide for energy, regulation, flexibility, and contingency. These technologies will be installed and validated in the ESIF.</p>
<p>As partners under INTEGRATE, technology providers will receive evaluations of their clean energy technologies to provide grid services. This includes the ability of the technologies to provide grid ancillary services (e.g. frequency regulation, spinning reserve, etc.) and other services of value to the grid. Technologies, which provide connected control, that are of interest include the following and related devices:</p>
<p>&bull; Residential PV inverters - individually and as a group <br />&bull; Non-residential PV inverters - individually and as a group <br />&bull; Integrated renewable and energy storage systems<br />&bull; Closed-loop power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) system testing<br />&nbsp; o Determining default smart inverter settings<br />&nbsp; o Grid-support behaviors of aggregation of small distributed PV<br />&nbsp; o Developing model library for power system components <br />&bull; Battery Energy Storage Systems<br />&bull; Fuel Cell Systems<br />&bull; Other Small Renewable Power Systems (e.g. wind, hydro/conduit, etc.)<br />&bull; Grid Connected vehicles <br />&bull; Combine heat and power (CHP) units<br />&bull; Thermal Energy Storage systems <br />&bull; Home Energy Management Systems<br />&bull; Campus Energy Management Systems<br />&bull; Microgrid Energy Management Systems<br />&bull; Distribution system voltage control units<br />&bull; Lighting systems<br />&bull; Refrigeration units<br />&bull; Heating and cooling systems<br />&bull; Home Appliances</p>
<p>This topic is not intended for the development of new devices, rather it is intended to help establish the methodology for enabling mature devices to provide grid services. <br /><br />Topic Area 2: Communication and Control Systems</p>
<p>To demonstrate operation of and carry out research on an integrated system consistent of multiple energy technologies (wind, solar, vehicles, building appliances, etc.) it is necessary to develop a communication, information, and computation (CIC) layer that supports system level control, e.g. to balance energy production and consumption and optimize operation. For this CIC layer to be fully interoperable and open sourced, it must be compatible with the common information model (CIM) and commonly used communication standards like IEC61850, SEP 2.0, DNP3, etc. Topic Area 2 of INTEGRATE project deals with the requirements, design, construction, and operation of the CIC layer.</p>
<p>For the CIC layer, INTEGRATE seeks to lay the foundation for simulating, testing, and comparing CIC architectures for the future power system. This includes centralized, distributed, hierarchical, and hybrid architectures using an assortment of communication and computation platforms. The CIC layer will also require additional, test-only functionality for such tasks as coordinating the simulated grid environment (e.g. PHIL testing), research-grade high-speed data acquisition, and multi-lab test coordination. Both the grid-deployed and test support elements must address data acquisition, data management, computation, co-simulation, storage, bandwidth and interoperability, and usability requirements.</p>
<p>Successful offerors will design, build, and test a flexible, open-source CIC infrastructure that allows for the interoperability of multiple energy efficiency, renewable power, and sustainable transportation technologies in a secure fashion. No proprietary CIC solutions will be considered in whole or in part.</p>
<p>Topic Area 3: Integrated Systems</p>
<p>Topic Area 3 of INTEGRATE seeks to investigate and demonstrate how clean energy technologies can work together holistically to provide grid services and increase the hosting capacity of these technologies on the grid. It will enable study of not only a single integrated system, but also various classes of energy systems, and various systems architectures using an open communication, information, and computation framework. This project will be the foundation to directly impact how future sustainable energy systems at various scales must be designed, operated, and managed in order to achieve their sustainability, economy and reliability objectives as well as paving the way for adoption of clean energy technologies at scale.</p>
<p>Successful offerors will develop and test solutions that leverage the characteristics (both energy consumption and generation characteristics) of clean energy technologies through connected controls (i.e. controls that use information to manage the connected technologies) to increase and/or enhance the deployment and integration of clean energy technologies in service territories through real and simulated installations. It is expected that successful offeros will propose integration of mature devices, with development efforts focused on integration and interoperability of these devices in a full system.</p>
<p>The planned RFP is focused primarily on the development of applications, resources, and solutions to the following use cases:</p>
<p>&bull; Consumer focused "Smart Home" <br />&bull; Owner focused building campuses <br />&bull; Service Territory Distribution Feeder</p>
<p><br />AREAS OF EXPERTISE</p>

<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP) directly addresses global health security threats by working with partner nations and other stakeholders to improve biosafety, biosecurity, and disease surveillance for traditional select agents (weapons-usable biological material) and emerging pathogens that may cause public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC).</p>
<p>The purpose of this SSSA is to identify potential sources with the requisite experience and skill sets required to perform the DTRA CBEP mission requirements of the proposed Scientific &amp; Technical Engagement Partnership (STEP). Through the STEP Program, CBEP will partner with a variety of collaborators (including research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and local scientists) to develop collaborative research programs, leading the way for future CBEP engagements. These activities will be augmented with specialized training in areas such as public health preparedness and emergency response; biological containment research and containment facilities engineering; One Health field surveillance and outbreak response; and, biosafety and biosecurity.&nbsp; The NAICS Codes for this requirement are 928120, 541712 and 541690.<br /><br />The contract will build a long-term partnership between strong research and technical centers and CBEP partner country institutions that will nourish and grow hypothesis-driven research programs that result in sustainable funding and academic publications. As a result of STEP engagements, CBEP partner countries will also have reduced the potential impact of biological threats through enhanced biological safety and security, awareness of biological risks, and knowledge related to biological pathogens.</p>

<RESPDATE>053014
<ARCHDATE>06292014
<CONTACT>Rob Stoltz
<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Department of Interior (DOI) Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the Federal Housing Finance Administration (FHFA) through the use of the Interior Franchise Fund (IFF) is seeking to obtain market research from vendors to assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the Strategic Software Vehicle industry.  Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining how small business could fit into the acquisition strategy.
BACKGROUND:  FHFA is working to strengthen and secure the United States secondary mortgage markets by providing effective supervision, sound research, reliable data, and relevant policies.
FHFA is an independent regulatory agency responsible for the oversight of vital components of the secondary mortgage markets-the housing government sponsored enterprises of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Combined these entities provide more than $5.5 trillion in funding for the U.S. mortgage markets and financial institutions.  Additionally, FHFA is the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
FHFA is building a better secondary mortgage market for the future. FHFA is pursuing a series of initiatives and strategies to improve the future system of housing finance. One important initiative is the creation of a new Common Securitization Platform that will serve the dual purpose of modernizing current outdated infrastructures and provide the potential for other market participants to use the same infrastructure.
FHFA works with those they regulate to preserve homeownership through the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). The programs provide real help to homeowners and communities - to date these programs have helped millions of Americans remain in their homes.
FHFA was created on July 30, 2008, when the President signed into law the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008.
The FHFA mission is to ensure the Housing Government-sponsored Enterprises operate in a safe and sound manner so they serve as a reliable source of liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment. Together these institutions provide more than $5 trillion in funding for the U.S. mortgage markets and financial institutions.

<CONTACT>Justin Fraser, Phone 3014354375, Email justin.fraser@nih.gov - Uyen Phuong, Phone 3014354382, Email Phuongu@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>Request for Information-NIHLM2014157<br /><br />Purpose<br />This Request for Information (RFI) numbered NIHLM2014157 offers health sciences and public libraries, health professionals, public health workers, community organizations, the general public, and other interested individuals and entities the opportunity to recommend effective approaches on how the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) (http://nnlm.gov) can provide all U.S. health professionals with equal access to biomedical information and improve the public's access to health information. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) manages the NN/LM. A Fact Sheet summarizing the NN/LM programs is available (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nnlm.html). <br /><br />Background<br />The NLM supports patients, health care providers, researchers, librarians and others, who seek current and high quality biomedical information and data. The NLM provides over 130 databases that cover health, genetics, drugs and chemicals, and many other topics. Those databases include, PubMed, MedlinePlus, Wiser, Clinical Trials, GeneEd and Genetics Home Reference, BLAST, Sequence Databases, UMLS, Raw Data and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In addition to the opportunities for librarians in informatics training programs, NLM currently supports post-masters training of health sciences librarians, mid-career leadership training, fellowships for combining subject matter and information science expertise and educational symposia on specific topics.
<p>In I965, the Medical Library Assistance Act (MLAA) established the National Network of Libraries of Medicine (P.L. 89-291) to assist in the development of medical libraries' services and to facilitate the dissemination and use of information related to health sciences. The NN/LM is managed by the National Library of Medicine via 5-year competitive contracts with eight Regional Medical Libraries (RMLs), an NLM Training Center (NTC) (http://nnlm.gov/ntc), and an Outreach Evaluation Resource Center (OERC) (http://nnlm.gov/evaluation). In addition to the RMLs, NTC and OERC the Network currently consist of over 6,000 member organizations. The Network provides convenient access to biomedical and health information resources for US health professionals, researchers, educators, and the general public. It is the core component of the NLM's outreach program, and its efforts to reduce health disparities and improve health information literacy. Through a variety of programs the NN/LM promotes professional development and lifelong learning opportunities for health sciences librarians.</p>
<p>The goals of the NN/LM are to:<br />&bull; Develop collaborations among health sciences libraries, other types of libraries and organizations to improve access to and sharing of biomedical information resources<br />&bull; Promote awareness of, access to, and use of biomedical information resources for health professionals and the public<br />&bull; Develop, promote and improve electronic access to health information by libraries, health professionals, and organizations providing health information to the public.</p>
<p>Information Requested<br />Recognizing that there have been many changes in information seeking behavior, technology, education, and the health care environment, NLM is seeking input from current and potential user communities to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine.<br />Your comments can include but are not limited to the following guiding questions.<br /><br />Priorities, Strategies, Partnerships<br />1. What priorities should the Network address? Provide recommendations. <br />2. What strategies should be used to reach varied populations, including minorities and the underserved? (We are interested in hearing about strategies and practices that have proven successful in the past and that might point the way to future strategies and practices.)<br />3. What are the most effective ways to partner with libraries, health, information, community organizations to reach health professionals, public health professionals, and the general public?<br /><br />Outreach, Programs Training, Resource Sharing<br />1. What new outreach roles and/or untapped outreach opportunities should be considered? What are barriers and opportunities in these new roles?<br />2. Which Network programs should receive less emphasis or be considered for elimination? Why?<br />3. What are the most effective strategies to support health sciences librarians in their knowledge and ability to support NLM products and services?<br />4. What role should resource sharing (Interlibrary Loan) play in supporting the Network's mission to promote access to biomedical and or health information? <br /><br />Membership, Network Structure, Service Coordination<br />1. What should be the responsibilities of Network membership? What should be the benefits?<br />2. What type of Network advisory structure is needed?<br />3. Will the geographical configuration of the Network meet future needs? What services of the Network could be coordinated nationally? What services are best coordinated at a local or regional level?<br /><br />Submitting a Response<br />All responses must be submitted via email to Justin Fraser at Justin.Fraser@nih.gov and Uyen Phuong at Phuongu@mail.nlm.nih.gov by 3 PM June 26, 2014. Please include the Notice number in the subject line. Response to this RFI is voluntary. Responders are free to address any or all of the categories listed above.</p>

<strong>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION</strong>.  This is a Request for Information (RFI); a market research tool used by the Government to gauge the marketplace and learn the industry's capabilities.  NOAA is also seeking to make a set-aside determination for this requirement.  Responses from qualified small businesses in all socioeconomic categories ((HUBZone, 8(a), SDVOSB, WOSB) will assist in that determination.<br /><br />The information requested hereunder is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or contract awarded.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information.  Responses to the notice will not be returned.  The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations. <br /><br /><strong>Overview of Potential Requirement:</strong><br /><br />The National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP), an office under the National Weather Service, is the nation's focal point for all matters relating to environmental modeling. Its mission is to deliver national and global weather, water, climate and space weather guidance, forecasts, warnings and analyses to its partners and external user communities.  In 1986, the Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), one of nine NCEP centers, established a scientific services program.  Since then, the services have provided computing programming for NCEP's mission, including development and maintenance of complex scientific algorithms for numerical forecast systems covering global and regional applications in weather, oceanographic, climate, land surface, air quality, hurricanes and hydrological forecast systems, together with transition of forecast, analysis, ensemble, data basing software and display system technology into operations.
<p>NCEP has a need for scientific services to (a) develop and maintain complex scientific algorithms for numerical forecast systems covering meteorological, oceanographic, air quality and environmental monitoring, ecosystem and hydrological forecast systems, and <br />(b) transition into operations numerical forecast system upgrades.  The "transition-to-operations" of each numerical forecast system upgrade involves both ensuring codes and scripts meet operational standards and testing systems immediately prior to operational implementation.</p>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in<br />connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a<br /><br />delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to<br />contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not<br />a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order<br />13126).

<p>&nbsp;DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CLAUSES:</p>
<p>1352.201-70 Contracting Officer's Authority (APR 2010).</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer,<br /><br />the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73 Compliance With the Laws (APR2010)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74 Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this<br />clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier<br /><br />expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and<br />"Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its<br />subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided,<br />neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>Description: The Corps of Engineers New England District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction project:  <br>  <br> The MATOC will comprise of a pool of contractors for construction, renovation and repair projects at Military and other Federal Facilities throughout the six New England States.  Primarily the work will be located within the New England District's geographical boundaries (VT, ME, NH, MA, RI, CT) but this contract may extend within the USACE North Atlantic Division Region (NY, NJ, PA, MD, DE, VA and Washington DC) in the continental United States. The work will consist of a broad range of construction tasks to include but not limited to minor new construction, renovation, repairs, upgrades, alterations, and preventive maintenance for vertical construction-type projects.   <br>  <br> The work for vertical construction may include but is not limited to: structural systems, roof systems, mechanical systems, plumbing systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, electrical systems, telecommunication systems, building security systems, and associated civil/site features (utilities, stormwater and wastewater management, parking, roadways, grading, landscaping, and site security).  Task orders issued under this contract may also include minor stand alone civil/site/infrastructure projects and the following types of work incidental to the vertical construction project: environmental abatement (such as lead paint or asbestos), general earthwork, miscellaneous interior/exterior elements, system testing, building commissioning, requirements for anti-terrorism and force protection (ATFP), LEED, LID, EISA, EPACT, historical building renovations, or incidental design. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: $7M for the base year followed by four one year options of $7M each for a total of $35M. <br>  <br> Period of Performance: Expected to begin August 2014 with a five year ordering period. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy: <br>  <br> a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects. <br>  <br> b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will <br>  <br> 1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other <br> matters; and  <br>  <br> 2. Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding PLA use are: <br>  <br> a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br>  <br> b. The complexity of the project. <br>  <br> c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br>  <br> d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br>  <br> e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects in this geographic area. <br>  <br> f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br>  <br> g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br>  <br> h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should a PLA be executed on the above described MATOC? What benefits do you believe a PLA could achieve? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions for the MATOC project? <br>  <br> b. Will the use of a PLA be effective in achieving economy and efficiency? If so, how? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using a PLA? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Are there any concerns regarding labor-management stability related to this project? Will the use of a PLA produce labor-management stability on this project? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? Are you aware of examples of labor-management conflicts in the area which could impact the efficiency of this project, which a PLA could positively impact/resolve? What market share does union labor in construction trades have in the geographic area? Which existing Collective Bargaining Agreements will expire during construction of this project? <br>  <br> d. Will use of a PLA be conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters on this project? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. This project will require construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades; do you foresee any work on this project that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Are there large scale construction projects in the area (over $25M, within 50 miles) which could impact availability of skilled labor for this project? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Are existing apprentice programs providing sufficient numbers of skilled workers for future requirements? <br>  <br> g. Is the proposed schedule/completion time one which would benefit from a PLA - if so, how? Will a PLA impact the completion time? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Have comparable projects been undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? For each project, please indicate if a PLA was used, the initial and final cost, number of trades on the project, if the project was completed on time, and if there were any challenges such as labor shortages, labor related delays, safety issues, etc .. <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via email to Kimberly Pumyea, Contract Specialist, at kimberly.b.pumyea@usace.army.mil no later than the close of business, 5pm EST on June 2, 2014.

<DESC>The Department of the Air Force, 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a Sole Source non-commercial, 5 year (FY15-FY20) Requirements contract with Goodrich Corporation (a business unit of UTC Aerospace Systems, a division of United Technologies Corporation), the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the DB-110 Reconnaissance (RECCE) Pod System. This proposed contract action is pursuant to the authority of 10 USC2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2),--Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Pursuant to FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii) all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
<p><br />The proposed procurement is for courseware development, airborne, ground segment, and imagery analysis training required for all Security Assistance and Security Cooperation customers. Training will consist of a combination of prepared classroom instruction, computer-based self-study, laboratory application, and on-the-job training to include the following:</p>
<p>1. Pod and Mission Planner Operations<br />2. Ground Station Operations<br />3. Airborne Segment O&amp;I Level Maintenance<br />4. Ground Station Maintenance<br />5. Data Link Operations <br />6. Train the Trainer<br />7. Upgrade Courses<br />8. Imagery Intelligence<br />9. Sensors<br />10. Analysis and Exploitation</p>
<p>The contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited for the following reasons:</p>
<p>a. Goodrich Corporation is the sole provider to deliver the DB-110 RECCE Pod System with all associated support equipment, initial training, and courseware. Security Assistance and Security Cooperation customers require specialized mission training to maintain and operate these systems.</p>
<p>b. The Goodrich DB-110 RECCE Pod System is designed for non-commercial application. The DB-110 REECE Pod is a day/night, tactical system that produces high resolution, dual-band imagery that can be stored on a solid state recorder and/or transmitted to the ground segment via a digital data link. Goodrich Corporation is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). No other contractor is capable of providing this specialized training.<br />&nbsp;</p>

The running gear system required must be independently attached to the trailer at the aft left and aft right corners without a tbru axle in order to allow an open space in the center of the trailer required for proper function.

<DESC>The US Army, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), seeks industry partners interested in entering a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) to provide Next Generation Proximity Sensors Technology support.   Participation will be via a CRADA with the National Armaments Consortium (NAC) and at the CRADA partner's expense, as no ARDEC funding will be provided. <br>  <br> The CRADA partners are expected to participate in several systems engineering reviews of a U.S. Government (USG) design. The USG will solicit individual, non-proprietary feedback from each partner in an effort to improve the product design.  This is not intended to be a co-development effort, as ARDEC will maintain the lead development role for research and engineering on this effort, it is expected that industry review and input into the design during the development process will provide early insight and strategic input into the program's development path.  <br>  <br> Interested participants should:  <br>  <br> o	Be a NAC member or provide evidence of pending NAC membership. <br> o	Possess in-house competency in the development, production and/or integration of proximity sensor components and/or systems for use in any munitions system (Artillery, Mortars, Missiles, Bombs, Rockets, Medium Caliber, UAS, CUAS, etc). <br> o	Possess in-house competency for the analysis and evaluation of miniature low power proximity fuze RADARs <br> o	Provide Subject matter experts having a minimum of SECRET security clearances and the ability to handle classified data/material up to the SECRET level. <br> o	Possess necessary support infrastructure to meet ARDEC requirements relating to Operations Security (OPSEC) and handling/storage of classified and/or Critical Program Information (CPI). <br>  <br> ARDEC asks all interested parties to submit a short informational paper to the following points of contact in order to confirm their interest:   Donald Geiss, 973-724-3386, email - donald.a.geiss.civ@mail.mil and Evan Young, 973-724-3 8973, email - evan.a.young6.civ@mail.mil.   All submissions must be provided by May 23, 2014.  These information papers should describe how the interested partners' meet the criteria above.  This may include a summary of expertise, capabilities, facilities and relevant experience in the fields of proximity sensors and fuzes.  This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. All information received will be used for planning and market research purposes only. <br>  <br> Please Note: Those NAC Companies that have already expressed interest by responding to the February 10, 2014 email from the NAC Executive Director, Subject: Fuze CRADA, need not resubmit. <br>

ORP intends to award a sole-source contract modification to EnergySolutions Federal EPC, Inc., located at 2345 Stevens Drive, Suite 240, Richland, WA 99354. 
Work under Modification 005 will support development of the vitrification process for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP).  The WTP is expected to treat both high-level waste (HLW) and low-activity waste (LAW).
CLIN 0018: Effect of Form of Chromium on Spinel Formation
A number of Hanford HLW streams contain sufficiently high concentrations of chromium for it to become the waste loading limiting component in the waste. Chromium has relatively low solubility in borosilicate glasses and leads to the formation of various crystal phases including spinels. The extent of crystal formation must be managed during melter processing to prevent operational issues and potential premature melter failure that can result from excessive accumulation of crystals in the melter. In recent work for ORP, high-waste loading glass formulations were developed for representative HLW streams that are high in chromium. Results from those studies showed differences in the crystallization behavior between glasses prepared in crucible melts and those prepared in DM100 joule heated melter runs. Understanding the cause of those differences has the potential to lead to the development of methods to further increase waste loadings for high chromium HLW streams through contr ol of the formation of chromium-bearing crystals. Testing is required to elucidate the origins of the observed differences but potential causes include differences in the form of components in the batch, including the form of chromium, as well as redox effects. In both cases, it is likely that these effects could be controlled through melter feed composition modifications. 
The work in this task will focus on determining the origins of the observed differences in crystallization behavior, as well as the effects of the form of chromium in the batch and the redox state of the melt on spinel crystallization. Based on those results, the work will also explore potential melter feed additives to influence the redox state of chromium in the melt and its effect on spinel crystallization. The objectives will be accomplished through a combination of crucible scale tests, small-scale tests under controlled redox conditions, and melter tests.
CLIN 0019: Effect of Minor Components on Salt Formation
Minor components such as S, Cr, Cl, F, P have a significant effect on sulfate salt formation, which is an issue for both LAW and HLW vitrification. In particular, in direct feed HLW options that are being considered for the WTP, less effective washing of the HLW solids could lead to increased levels of these species in the HLW feeds. Testing of the propensity for salt formation during vitrification ultimately requires testing on small- and pilot-scale joule-heated melter systems. However, in previous work, several very effective crucible-scale screening tests have been developed and employed to screen for sulfate salt separation in order to minimize the number of the more costly melter tests that are required. Until recently, these screening tests were limited in their ability to include the important effects of other very volatile minor components such as Cl and F. As part of recent work for ORP, VSL developed a closed crucible glass melt testing method that was found to be  effective in keeping the volatile components in the closed crucible. Using this method, salt formation in LAW melts was studied while maintaining high Cl concentrations in the melt. Thus, this method provides an effective screening test to efficiently address the effects of other minor components on salt formation. 
In this task the closed crucible method will be extended to other LAW compositions and to HLW melts to investigate the effects of various minor components such as S, Cr, Cl, F and P on secondary sulfate phase formation. The melts will be prepared in the closed crucibles with excess amounts of volatile components so that the concentrations of components in the melt that exist in equilibrium with a salt phase can be determined. The study will be used to define the upper limits of the concentrations of minor components, especially volatile minor components, which can be present in the melter feed without the risk of secondary salt phase formation in the melter. Thus, this work will serve to better define the operating envelope with respect to these constituents.
CLIN 0020: Nepheline Management in Hanford HLW Glass
A number of Hanford HLW streams contain high concentrations of Al and Na, resulting in nepheline formation during CCC becoming the waste loading limiting constraint in about 30% of HLW glass to be produced at the WTP. Previous work by VSL/EnergySolutions has identified high waste loading glass formulations that meet all processing and product quality requirements to treat a number of these HLW streams. However, these formulations would be excluded by the nepheline constraint that is presently employed by the WTP. Accordingly, an improved nepheline discriminator is needed that would allow access to these demonstrated high waste loading formulations. At present, there are insufficient data to define composition boundaries to separate composition spaces that are prone to nepheline crystallization from those that are not.
This work will be focused on developing a method to predict nepheline formation on CCC as a function of glass composition and defining composition boundaries to ensure that the glass compositions selected for waste processing at the WTP will not be prone to nepheline crystallization. This effort will build on previous work done by VSL and others for DOE and its contractors. Statistically designed glass composition matrices will be used to cover composition ranges of interest. Crucible melts of the resulting glass compositions will be prepared and characterized for their tendency for nepheline crystallization on CCC. The newly collected data, along with existing data on high-Al glasses, will be used to develop models that relate nepheline formation to glass composition. The nepheline models will be used as part of the constraints in HLW glass property-composition models to define acceptable glass compositions for HLW processing at the WTP.
CLIN 0021: Optimization of LAW Glass Former Additives
Melter feeds for LAW waste vitrification are prepared by adding suitable glass former additives to the waste. The glass former additives for the WTP baseline feeds include silica (SiO2), kyanite (Al2O3, SiO2), boric acid (B2O3), wollastonite (CaO, SiO2), iron oxide (Fe2O3), olivine (MgO, SiO2), lithium carbonate (Li2O), rutile (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), and zircon (ZrO2, SiO2); the major oxides provided by each of the raw materials are provided in parenthesis. The higher waste loading ORP glass formulations employ three more additives, namely SnO2, V2O5 and Cr2O3. Previous work to support the WTP baseline selection of glass former additives concentrated on the rheology, settling, and stability of the resulting melter feed. In addition, the feed concentrations were maintained at a target glass yield of about 1000 g/l by adjusting the concentration of the waste. However, no effort was directed towards exploring the effect of particle size or raw material form on feed processing  rate. Consequently, a reevaluation and possible further optimization of the LAW glass former additives is appropriate to determine whether increases in melting rates are possible through adjustments in the glass former additives. Under the LAW direct feed scenario, LAW at various concentrations may be delivered to the WTP and, therefore, there is a need to develop melter feeds with acceptable rheology at various feed solids contents. In addition, some of the glass former additive raw materials that were previously selected for the WTP baseline are no longer available commercially from the selected vendors, so new raw materials or new raw material sources need to be identified.
This task will focus on identifying LAW glass former additives, with particular emphasis on their effect on feed processing rate, while maintaining feed rheological properties within the bounds specified by WTP. Variables that will be tested include different raw material sources that are economical and commercially available, and different particle sizes, especially for silica. Rheological studies will also be extended to LAW melter feeds at various solids contents and potential strategies to control their rheological properties within WTP bounds. The objectives will be accomplished through a combination of rheological property measurements, vertical gradient furnace (VGF) tests as screening tools for feed processing rate, and DM100 melter tests to confirm feed processing characteristics.
CLIN 0022: Support for Direct Feed LAW 
In the LAW direct feed option, the pretreatment facility is bypassed and LAW is fed to the vitrification facility with minimal in-tank or near-tank pretreatment, which will likely involve ion-exchange and solids removal. Without the capability for evaporation, some feeds to the vitrification facility will be delivered at much lower than design concentrations. The secondary waste from the melter operations will either be stored or treated and disposed. To support development of the direct feed LAW flowsheet, it is necessary to determine the compositions of the effluents from the off-gas system, especially the Submerged Bed Scrubber (SBS) and the Wet Electrostatic Precipitator (WESP), in order to assess potential disposition strategies for those streams. One of the DM10 melter systems installed at the VSL has been equipped with the components that are prototypical of those in the WTP primary off-gas systems, specifically, the SBS and the WESP; the DM10 system also includes a va cuum evaporator that allows testing to be conducted under recycle conditions. This is an efficient and economical system on which to obtain information on the compositions of the primary off-gas system effluents. 
In this task, DM10 melter tests will be conducted with candidate LAW feeds to determine primary off-gas system effluent compositions. Initial testing will be performed using a WTP LAW feed that has already been tested in the HLW Pilot Melter so that a comparison can be obtained between data from the HLW Pilot Melter system and the DM10 system. A second series of tests will be conducted using an ORP LAW feed previously tested on the DM100 at different solids concentration to determine the effect of feed solids concentration on primary off gas effluent concentrations.

<CONTACT>Brenda E. Monch, Phone 4109659521, Email brenda.monch@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to extend contract number SS00-10-60005 with Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), Richmond, Virginia on a sole source basis for a period of nine and one half months. The purpose of this contract is to provide specialized training and technical support to projects holding a Work Incentive Planning and Assistance (WIPA) cooperative agreement, SSA demonstration project staff, and community partners. This includes updating and developing reference materials, providing initial and supplemental training to increase or maintain the consistency, thoroughness, and accuracy of services beneficiaries receive, and providing support to the WIPA projects and to Social Security on the practical use for the data system we require.
<p>VCU currently supports WIPA projects by providing work incentives planning, assistance, and outreach services in all States, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories. WIPA projects serve adult Social Security and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries with disabilities, targeting populations such as transition-age youth and members of Native American communities who receive Social Security or Supplemental Security Income and other benefits based on disability. The goal of the WIPA program is to assist such beneficiaries in their efforts to work, primarily by removing one of the major barriers: uncertainty and fear about the immediate and long-term effects of work on net income and healthcare coverage.</p>
<p>This extension will cover the period of 11/12/2014 through 8/31/2015. However, the technical assistance and training support will only be required through 6/11/201. It is necessary to extend this contract through 8/31/2015 to allow for time to complete the final annual report.</p>
<p>This procurement is being made under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1)) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>The sole source is based on the VCU's unique ability to perform the services during this transition period. VCU staff and subcontractors have unique skills and expertise assisting Social Security grantees to understand and communicate the incredible complexity surrounding return to work for people with disabilities. VCU has an intimate understanding of the WIPA projects, the database WIPA projects use, and the intricacies of protocol and experience of the Helpline, demonstration projects and community partners. Given the short period of performance for this extension, VCU as the current technical assistance and training provider, is in a unique position to provide the continued services without any impact to WIPA projects and other customers.</p>
<p>This is not a formal solicitation. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that the required capability is available from other sources and competition would be advantageous to the Government. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement , proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. If no affirmative written response is received, the procurement will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address by 9:00 am EST, May 30, 2014: brenda.monch@ssa.gov.</p>

<SUBJECT>Collaborative R&D Opportunity:  Integrity Levels: A New Paradigm for Protecting Computing Systems
<SOLNBR>14_411
<RESPDATE>071214
<CONTACT>Sandia CRADA Team, Email CRADA@sandia.gov
<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background Information:</strong></span><br />As the field of determined and increasingly sophisticated adversaries multiplies, the required integrity of deployed computing devices magnifies. Given the ubiquitous connectivity, substantial storage, and accessibility, the increased reliance on computer platforms make them a substantial target for attackers. While computer systems require patches to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities, undiscovered vulnerabilities potentially remain. Signature-based schemes seek to detect malware with a known signature or digital fingerprint. Signature-less schemes seek to detect anomalies within the computer system by understanding normal behavior. Both architectures are typically built on top of existing solutions or paradigms. These solutions tend to utilize mechanisms that operate within the OS. If the OS becomes compromised, these mechanisms may be vulnerable to deactivation.<br /><br />Sandia proposes a new approach to designing computer systems that inherently decouples the function of the computer system from its security specification. While most solutions tend to focus on prevention and detection, our framework looks to alter behavior based on compromise. The proposed approach leverages a three- pronged design methodology. First, a model is composed that separates computer operations into four distinct domains. Second, architectural requirements for a feasible implementation are stated. Last, a policy specification of the system to mitigate anomalies of security concern by navigating between integrity levels is described. This innovative paradigm can use existing technologies in a novel manner to determine the integrity level of the system. Based on the integrity level, the system may behave differently and/or limit access to data available. Integrity levels work for both traditional and non-traditional computing environments given the appropriate model, architecture, and policy. Furthermore, the approach does not directly compete with any current solutions and can potentially integrate with existing solutions to facilitate an integrity level-designed system.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Opportunity Description: </strong></span><br />Sandia is seeking a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with an industrial partner interested in the joint development and eventual deployment of this novel approach. Collaborative work aimed at advancing this concept from TRL 3 to TRL 6-7 may include:<br /><br />1.	Refining the API and turning the codebase into a library that can be used by any hypervisor on different traditional architectures. <br />2.	Refining the taxonomy to allow more flexibility of stating acceptable states and/or conditions of the functional domain. <br />3.	Enabling a consistent methodology for integrity level development of existing and new application spaces <br />4.	Enabling distinct integrity levels for distinct elements in the functional domains <br />5.	Developing prototypes on ARM Trustzone<sup>TM</sup> SoCs and/or Intel TXT/SGX processors and SoCs<br /><br />Sandia invites interested parties to provide a detailed description of relevant background, experience, expertise, and capabilities that could be brought into a collaborative partnership with Sandia. Responses should address the following:<br /><br />1.	Description of experience, expertise, and capabilities with ARM Trustzone<sup>TM</sup> platforms or Intel TXT/SGX <br />2.	Description of experience, expertise, and capabilities with kernel development <br />3.	Description of experience, expertise, and capabilities with toolchain, API, and standard methodology development <br />4.	Description of experience, expertise, and capabilities with different hypervisors (preferably Type-I hypervisors) <br />5.	Description of experience, expertise, and capabilities with non-traditional computing environments <br />6.	Ability to take technology from TRL 3 to TRL 6 or 7. <br />7.	Description of past or current experience partnering with R&amp;D organizations such as Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).<br /><br />The ideal partner will be able to contribute a minimum of $400K per year for 2 - 4 years. Amounts below the specified merit will be considered after reviewing appropriate justification and capability support.<br /><br />In addition, Sandia will evaluate responses against the following criteria, pursuant to Sandia's technology transfer mission:<br /><br />1.	How will the respondent deploy the technology for the benefit of the U.S. public good?<br />2.	How will the respondent's deployment of the technology benefit U.S. economic competitiveness?<br /><br />Interested parties that meet the criteria outlined above are invited to respond. Responses should be emailed to Sandia's CRADA team at CRADA@sandia.gov .<br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<p>L-514 CONTRACTOR PASSES</p>
<p>1. Normal Installation Entry. Entry to MAFB requires possession and verification of approved identification credentials. Personnel without valid identification will be referred to the Visitor Control Center (VCC) located at the 2nd Avenue North Gate entrance. People who cannot be properly identified or sponsored will be denied entry.<br />2. Contractor Access: Upon award of a contract, the contractor awarded the contract will be issued a request for a Contractor Entry Authority List (CEAL) by the contract administrator. Upon receipt, the contractor must compile the information required for the CEAL and submit a completed CEAL to the contract administrator. Until this occurs, no employees will be permitted to enter Malmstrom AFB. <br />3. The contracting office approves the list and hand carries it to the Pass and Registration Section (341 SFS/S5B) for review. S5B personnel will compare the approving official's signature against a DD Form 577, Signature Card, or an appropriate letter on file at pass and registration. S5B then hand carries the submission to the 911 Dispatch Center.<br />4. A 911 dispatcher certified on the National Criminal Information Center system (NCIC) will run the contractor names through the NCIC for wants and warrants. The 911Dispatch Center will input all listed employees' names and data into the National Criminal Information Center (NCIC) database for a background check in accordance with Air Force directives. Unfavorable results from the background check will result in individuals being denied access to the installation, including, but not limited to, individuals that are determined to fall into one or more of the following categories: those having outstanding wants or warrants, sex offenders, violent offenders, those who are on probation, and those who are in a pre-release program. The definition of sex offender and violent offender can be found at Montana Code Annotated &sect; 46-23-502. After the dispatcher completes the NCIC check, they will sign the letters and return them to S5B. Unfavorable results will be grounds for denial of entry.<br />5. Retired military members and dependents of active duty or retired military members who are contractor employees must use their valid DoD ID card when entering Malmstrom AFB for the performance of contract services and must prominently display identification badges while performing work on the installation. No Common Access Card (CAC) will be issued to these individuals with an Armed Forces ID. Under no circumstance will retired military members or dependents of active duty or retired military members vouch contractor personnel onto the installation utilizing their Armed Forces Identification Card. Only those contractors who have been issued a DoD CAC will be allowed to sign and escort people onto the installation.<br />6. Contractor personnel requesting a contractor pass will provide a picture ID to be verified against the Contractor EAL. Those employees, who clear the background check process, will be issued passes by S5B, located in Building 250, for the duration of the contract or one year, whichever period is shorter. For contracts lasting more than one year, including contract options, renewals and extensions, the contractor must repeat the above stated process on an annual basis. In addition, the process must be initiated for all new employees who are added to the CEAL after its initial submission.<br />7. Contractors are required to notify the contracting officer and S5B if an employee on a CEAL terminates his or her employment with the contractor or is involved in an incident that would result in unfavorable results from the background check including, but not limited to, those identified in paragraph 4 above. If a contractor terminates an employee, it is incumbent upon the contractor to ensure that the employee's access badge is returned to the Pass and Registration office. If they are unable to retrieve the pass, they will contact S5B with the employee's information. S5B will then contact the installation entry control points and have them retrieve the pass if the person attempts to re-enter the base. In the case of a missile field contractor the S5B will contact Keys and Codes Control Center.<br />8. Violations of the stated entry procedures will be considered a breach of contract and the contracting officer will take appropriate action in accordance with the contract. Repeated or flagrant violations of this policy may result in termination of the contract for default. Contractor/vendor passes are for granting access to the installation for the sole purpose of employment. These passes do not permit access to or usage of government facilities or services (i.e., gym, service station, and dining hall.) However, during contractor/vendor "duty hours," the Burger King, Base Exchange Bowling Alley and Grizzly Bend Club eateries may be utilized.<br />9. Local delivery companies (e.g., food, furniture, appliances) will submit a letter to the 341 SFS Pass and Registration Section containing the name of the company, the driver's name(s), date of birth, driver's license number and vehicle information. All information will be cross-checked against the installation barment and revocation list and the NCIC via the 911 Dispatch Center prior to approval. A copy of the letter will be maintained in the possession of the driver requesting entry. If the driver does not possess a letter, he/she will be directed to the VCC where an AF IMT 75, Visitor/Vehicle Pass, will be issued after verification of the delivery has been made through the on-base residence sponsor.<br />10. Vehicles owned by your firm will be permitted entry to Malmstrom AFB if they are conspicuously marked with your firm's name or log, with the exception of magnetic signs, when you have contract requiring performance on the base. If your vehicles are not so marked, it will be necessary for you to obtain a temporary vehicle registration for each vehicle to be operated on Malmstrom AFB. This registration is accomplished by the contractor or designated representative at the Pass and Registration Section. Proof of ownership and a current valid driver's license are required for vehicle registration. You or your representative will be required to have insurance coverage on the vehicle to meet Montana State minimum requirement.<br /><br />(xv) Quote is required to be received NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM MST, Thursday, 21 May 2014. Quote must be emailed to sarah.markovich@us.af.mil or faxed to (406) 731-4608 to the attention of Sarah Markovich. Please follow-up quote submission with an email to ensure receipt.<br />(xvi) Direct your questions to Sarah Markovich at (406) 731-3624 or e-mail address sarah.markovich@us.af.mil or Bethany West at (406) 731-3473 or e-mail address bethany.west@us.af.mil.</p>

<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial items:</p>
<p>This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable offeror. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p>1. Price</p>
<p>2. Technical Capability: All offerors shall submit technical description of the products being offered in sufficient detail in addition to the price proposal, to evaluate compliance with the requirements in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration. A single award will result from this evaluation.</p>
<p>(ii) Next, the Government shall evaluate the offerors's technical information as referenced in paragraph (a)2 above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as "met" or "failed" by personnel designated in 26 STS/AFE. Technical acceptability is met when the offeror submits proof of technical descriptions/information as stated above and compliance with the delivery requirement.</p>
<p>(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical capability as defined in above paragraph (a)2, this Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability.

FAR 52.204-7, System for Award Management; FAR 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance, FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions; FAR 52.225-25, Prohibition on Contracting with Entities Engaging in Certain Activities or Transactions Relating to Iran - Representation and Certifications; FAR 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination;</p>
<p>The following FAR clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated in full text:</p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Initially the Government will rank all proposals by Total Evaluated Price (TEP). Secondly, the Government will evaluate the lowest priced proposal for technical acceptability. Finally, the Government will evaluate Past Performance. If the lowest offer is technically acceptable and is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers. If the lowest priced proposal is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence," the Government will evaluate the next lowest offer until a proposal is technically acceptable and has a "Substantial Confidence" performance confidence assessment.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) price<br />&#61607; The TEP will be calculated as the sum of the Offeror's proposed prices for the base period of one year, all option periods (4 years) and the 6-month extension provided in accordance with FAR 52.217-8. Evaluation of options/extensions shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options or extensions. The TEP will be used for evaluation purposes only.<br />&#61607; Proposals shall be evaluated to determine price fair and reasonableness IAW FAR 13.106-3(a).</p>
<p>(ii) technical capability of the service offered to meet the Government requirement<br />&#61607; Contractor shall submit detailed specifications as to how they will meet all requirements listed in the SOW to include methods, equipment, and cleaning solutions that will be used. Offeror not submitting all information in this paragraph will be deemed non-responsive.</p>
<p>(iii) past performance <br />&#61607; The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. The Past Performance factor will receive one of the performance confidence assessments shown below, excerpted from DoD source Selection Procedures, <br /><br />Table 1 - Performance Confidence Assessments.</p>
<p>TABLE 1- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br /><br />NO CONFIDENCE Based on the offeror's recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE (NEUTRAL) No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.&nbsp;<br /><br /> Past Performance Evaluation Process. The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the contract's requirements. Performance confidence is assessed at the overall Past Performance factor level after evaluating aspects of the offeror's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the technical subfactors and price factor.</p>
<p>Examples of past performance may include Letters of appreciation, recognition, or commendation etc... received on behalf of a customer may be submitted to include name, phone number, and <br />e-mail address. The Government will consider up to three (3) such documents. Work should have been accomplished in the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>(i) Recency Assessment<br />An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent. To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during <br />the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation. Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>(ii) Relevancy Assessment</p>
<p>The Government will conduct an evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine how closely the products provided/services performed under those contracts relate to the performance work statement of this request for proposal. A relevancy determination of the offeror's past performance will be made based upon the aforementioned considerations, including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s). In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will <br />be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. The past performance information forms (PIFs) and information obtained from other sources will be used to establish the degree of relevancy of past performance. The Government will use the following relevancy definitions when assessing recent, relevant contracts:</p>
<p>Rating Definition<br />VERY RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved essentially the same scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>SOMEWHAT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved some of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>NOT RELEVANT Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Assigning Ratings. As a result of the relevancy of the recent contracts evaluated, offerors will receive an integrated performance confidence assessment rating. Although the past performance evaluation focuses on performance that is relevant to the technical capability and the price factors, the resulting performance confidence assessment rating is made at the factor level and represents an overall evaluation of contractor performance. Offerors without a record of recent/relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and, as a result, will receive an "Unknown Confidence" rating for the Past Performance factor.</p>
<p>More recent and relevant performance will have a greater impact on the Performance Confidence <br />Assessment than less recent or relevant effort. A strong record of relevant past performance may <br />be considered more advantageous to the Government than an "Unknown Confidence" rating.<br />Likewise, a more relevant past performance record may receive a higher confidence rating and <br />be considered more favorably than a less relevant record of favorable performance. Technical <br />and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE:</p>
<p>A security pre-clearance must be performed for any employees referred to HIS through this contract.<br />Fingerprints must be completed and adjudicated prior to services being performed under this contract.<br />No contract award shall be made to any vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov throughout the duration of the contract. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the acquisition official if there is a change in provider.<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer. In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>
<p>ACCEPTANCE PERIOD: Your quotation must stipulate that it is predicated upon all the terms and conditions of this RFQ. In addition, it must contain a statement to the effect that it is firm for a period of at least 30 days from the date of receipt by the Government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING ELECTRONIC INVOICING (NAVSEA) (SEP 2012)</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor agrees to segregate costs incurred under this contract/task order (TO), as applicable, at the lowest level of performance, either at the technical instruction (TI), sub line item number (SLIN), or contract line item number (CLIN) level, rather than on a total contract/TO basis, and to submit invoices reflecting costs incurred at that level. Supporting documentation in Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) for invoices shall include summaries of work charged during the period covered as well as overall cumulative summaries by individual labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of other direct costs (ODCs), materials, and travel, by TI, SLIN, or CLIN level. For other than firm fixed price subcontractors, subcontractors are also required to provide labor categories, rates, and hours (both straight time and overtime) invoiced; as well as, a cost breakdown of ODCs, materials, and travel invoiced. Supporting documentation may be encrypted before submission to the prime contractor for WAWF invoice submittal. Subcontractors may email encryption code information directly to the Contracting Officer (CO) and Contracting Officer Representative (COR). Should the subcontractor lack encryption capability, the subcontractor may also email detailed supporting cost information directly to the CO and COR; or other method as agreed to by the CO.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors submitting payment requests and receiving reports to WAWF using either Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) or Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) shall separately send an email notification to the COR and CO on the same date they submit the invoice in WAWF. No payments shall be due if the contractor does not provide the COR and CO email notification as required herein.</p>

<p>(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>The USU is the only Federal health sciences university and we are committed to excellence in military medicine and public health during peace and war.  We provide the Nation with health professionals dedicated to career service in the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and with scientists who serve the common good.  We serve the uniformed services and the Nation as an outstanding academic health sciences center with a worldwide perspective for education, research, service, and consultation; we are unique in relating these activities to military medicine, disaster medicine, and military medical readiness.  USU is located in Bethesda, MD on the grounds of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding USU and its mission can be found on our website: www.usuhs.mil.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Quotes (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-72, effective January 30, 2014 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), effective April 28, 2014.</p>
<p>In order to be eligible for award, offerors must be registered on SAM.gov with completed Representations &amp; Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs).  Offerors not registered on SAM.gov with completed Reps &amp; Certs will not be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in responding to this requirement must provide a quote for various animal serological parasitological tests, which at a minimum, meets the specifications listed below.  A single, five-year, firm-fixed price (FFP) blanket purchase agreement (BPA) will be issued.</p>
<p>Historically, we have issued an FFP, option-year purchase order (PO) HU0001-09-M-D455 worth $140,000.00 over five years for various animal serological tests.  However, please note that we cannot guarantee the minimum or maximum spending level for this BPA.</p>
<p>Offerors should understand that a BPA is not a requirements contract.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to use other sources for these services if doing so is determined to be in our best interest.</p>
<p>Minimum Specifications:</p>
<p>USU will collect, package, and ship the necessary samples for testing as need arises.  We possess the capability to collect the samples in either serum or dried blood spot format.</p>
<p>We require a short turnaround time (3 to 5 days) from when the vendor receives our sample(s).  This time frame includes processing, testing, and reporting.</p>
<p>Interested vendors must state all the supplies that are included in the proposed pricing.  This may include shipping boxes, delivery cost, serum vials, dried blood spot strips, etc.  These inclusions will be noted and considered when we evaluate the price.</p>
<p>Every now and then, we have a need for other animal serological tests that are not listed on the CLIN Structure spreadsheet.  For this reason, we intend to include the winning bidder's entire animal serology catalog in this BPA.  Interested vendors must provide an Excel spreadsheet of their complete animal serology catalog.  This Excel spreadsheet must include the itemized, proposed prices.</p>
<p>All BPA order calls will be paid for using a government purchase card (GPC), which is a Visa card.  Offerors must be able to accept credit card payments and all associated processing/interaction fees must be included in your proposed price.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />Primary Point of Contact:</p>

<p>52.212-2 - Evaluation - Commercial Items - Addendum</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>1. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD</p>
<p>A. This is a competitive Best Value acquisition using the lowest price technically acceptable evaluation process, with technical proposals. This procurement will be conducted as a Total Small Business Set-Aside for small business concerns eligible under the small business program. The Government will award a contract resulting from the solicitation to the acceptable, responsible Small Business offeror whose proposal conforming to this solicitation offers the Best Value to the Government Evaluation criteria are the same for all competing offerors.</p>
<p>B. Offerors shall propose on all items. Any offer that fails to cite a price for each item or fails to make an entry that indicates service will be provided at no charge may be rejected as nonconforming to this solicitation.</p>
<p>C. Only Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) offers will be evaluated. An offer using a sliding price scale or subject to escalation based on any contingency will not be accepted.</p>
<p>D. The evaluation process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1. Price: Initially, offers will be ranked according to Total Evaluated Price (TEP). The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness based on prices submitted from competitive proposals, current market conditions, and comparison to the Government estimate. Prices will also be evaluated to determine if they are materially unbalanced. Materially unbalanced prices risk rejection.</p>
<p>2. The lowest priced offeror will be evaluated for technical acceptability. If the offeror meets all criteria the process will end and award will made to that offeror. If the offeror does not meet all criteria the process will move on to next lowest priced offeror and so on until an award is made.</p>
<p>a. Offerors will be rated Technically Acceptable or Technically Unacceptable. Definitions of technical ratings are:<br />b. Technically Acceptable - The offerors proposal clearly and/or specifically addresses all aspects of the requested technical proposal, to include all significant factors and sub-factors. <br />c. Technically Unacceptable -The offerors proposal does not clearly and/or specifically addresses all aspects of the requested technical proposal, to include all significant factors and sub-factors. <br />d. All offerors will be rated against the Technical Evaluation Checklist (Attachment 2). An offeror rated technically unacceptable in any one area will receive an overall rating of Technically Unacceptable. Offerors must be Technically Acceptable in all factors and sub factors to be rated Technically Acceptable.</p>
<p>3. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>
<p>4. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers: The Government may reject any proposal that is assessed to be unrealistic in terms of contract requirements, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in cost, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect lack of competence or failure to comprehend the scope of the requirement. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of price may be rejected at any time during the evaluation process. Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the offerors (other than minor clarification[s]), unless discussions are determined to be necessary. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. Offerors may be required to participate in telephone discussions or in face-to-face oral discussions at the Operational Contracting Division, 308 West "D" Avenue, Suite 130, Bldg 260, Eglin AFB FL. Offerors are cautioned to follow the detailed instructions fully and carefully, as the Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial offers received, without discussion of such offers. The offeror's initial proposal should reflect their best effort.</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks. Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.

It is the Contractor?s responsibility to assure all personnel scheduled to work on the installation have acceptable backgrounds. <BR> <BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with. <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer. However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC. The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum. Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Facsimile Number (703) 806-8866 or 8875 Packages sent by FEDEX or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Ft.

The main gate is approximately 90 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. Contractors may be required to travel up to 150 miles one way from Salt Lake City to reach some work sites. <BR> <BR>Contractors with valid U.S. government contracts will be allowed to hire non U.S. citizens to work at or visit U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) during performance of the contract.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>In order to enhance the efficiency of the procurement process, the Government intends to evaluate only the lowest priced quote to determine if the quote is technically acceptable and whether the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance.  If the lowest priced quote is reasonably priced and technically acceptable and the vendor has acceptable or neutral past performance, the Government intends to make an award to that vendor and no other quote will be evaluated.  If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined. Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>The contract price includes all applicable Federal, state, and local taxes and duties. <BR> <BR>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.) <BR> <BR>Procedures for commercial vehicle access to military installations are varied.   To enter the installation, the Contractor should thoroughly comply with the access procedures of a respective installation. The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the access procedures enforced by each military installation.  The Contractor shall completely coordinate with the military installations and the delivery point of contacts. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall stamp or mark the supplies delivered or otherwise furnish notice with the supplies of the existence of a warranty.  Markings shall include (i) a brief statement that a warranty exists, (ii) the substance of the warranty, (iii) its duration, and (iv) who to notify if the supplies are found to be defective. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.  Notify the individual in Block 16 of any delay encountered (due to strikes, factory backorders, etc.)  and give revised delivery date if possible.     c. Mark outside of all cartons.  Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>The Government reserves the right to vary quantities by +/- 30% due to operational requirements and to make multiple awards to meet said requirements. The Government also reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. The Government will not be charged for mission changes. <BR> <BR>The Government will not be responsible for returning equipment with a full tank of gas or paying to refuel the equipment at the end of the Period of Performance. DELIVERY/PICKUP AND REFUELING COST MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE QUOTE. <BR> <BR>Option for Increased Quantity (Mar 1989)
The Government may increase the quantity of supplies called for in the Schedule at the unit price specified. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 45 days of the first day of the period of performance. Delivery of the added items shall continue at the same rate as the like items called for under the contract, unless the parties otherwise agree. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled AVIONICS UPGRADE OF NASA GLENN RESEARCH CENTER DHC6 RESEARCH AIRCRAFT which was posted on May 02, 2014. You are notified that the following changes are made: <p> The due date for responses is extended to May 30, 2014 at 4:30pm EST. <p> <p QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: <p> Question #1:  Per Section 2.a.i of the Evaluation Criteria, as detailed on SOW Page 26, Offerors possession of a Garmin Dealership is an asserted requirement.  Is the requirement for offeror to be an approved Garmin Dealer intended at time of Proposal Submission, or at time of Contract Award? <p>    Answer #1:	The  offeror shall be an approved  Garmin Dealer at the time of Proposal Submission. <p> Question #2:  Per Requirements Section 2, on SOW Page 6, all work is to be performed by 14 CFR Part 65 certificated personnel.	Per Section 2.b.i of the Evaluation Criteria, on SOW Page 26, possession of an FAA Approved Repairmen Certificate (see 14 CFR Part 65 Subpart E Sections 65.101 and 65.103) seems to be omitted from the list of required certifications.  If a FAA Part 145 CRS Offeror includes, as elements of their offer, personnel that possess FAA Approved Repairmen Certificates, those offers will be considered compliant and acceptable, with respect to evaluation criteria element 2.b.i, correct? <p>    Answer #2:	It is the requirement of the government that technical personnel working on the avionics modification meet those qualifications listed on page 26 of the SOW (Technical Capability, Personnel Qualifications).  These are in addition to FAA or Company requirements necessary as part of employment by a Certified Repairs Station. <P> Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

As used in this clause-- Manufactured end product means any end product in Federal Supply Classes (FSC) 1000-9999, except-- (1) FSC 5510, Lumber and Related Basic Wood Materials; (2) Federal Supply Group (FSG) 87, Agricultural Supplies; (3) FSG 88, Live Animals; (4) FSG 89, Food and Related Consumables; (5) FSC 9410, Crude Grades of Plant Materials; (6) FSC 9430, Miscellaneous Crude Animal Products, Inedible; (7) FSC 9440, Miscellaneous Crude Agricultural and Forestry Products; (8) FSC 9610, Ores; (9) FSC 9620, Minerals, Natural and Synthetic; and (10) FSC 9630, Additive Metal Materials. Place of manufacture means the place where an end product is assembled out of components, or otherwise made or processed from raw materials into the finished product that is to be provided to the Government. If a product is disassembled and reassembled, the place of reassembly is not the place of manufacture. (b) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-- (1) (  ) In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or (2) (  ) Outside the United States. (End of provision) <BR> <BR>The Government contemplates award of a    FFP   contract resulting from this solicitation. (End of provision) <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>System for Award Management Alternate A 	MAY 2013 <BR> <BR>Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports 	JUN 2012 <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated. Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.)

<p><br />52.225-17 EVALUATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OFFERS (FEB 2000)</p>
<p>If the Government receives offers in more than one currency, the Government will evaluate offers by converting the foreign currency to United States currency using a conversion rate of $1.00 = JPY 103.9439.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONST-M-7400 BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD (JUN 2006):</p>
<p>This is a lowest price technically acceptable award. All technically acceptable quotations shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in a quotation being determined technically unacceptable. A quotation must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Technical Acceptability - Initially, the Government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the quotation's Technical Requirements on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable. The quotations shall be evaluated against the following subfactors:</p>
<p>1. Recent/Relevant Experience. The government will evaluate the extent to which a quoter's specific experience is directly related to the work required by the solicitation. Moreover, consideration will be given to whether the experience is considered recent (either on-going or completed within the last five years) and relevant (e.g., whether it is considered similar in type, size, scope, and complexity). The Government will evaluate the quotations based on information contained in Attachment 1, Submission of Recent/Relevant Experience.</p>
<p>Note to Quoters: A technical quotation rated Unacceptable will not be considered for award. There will be no point scores assigned, only Acceptable or Unacceptable. In addition, the Government shall use the following technical acceptable/unacceptable ratings definitions when assigning technical ratings of Acceptable or Unacceptable (Table 1).</p>
<p>Table 1, Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings<br />Rating Description<br />Acceptable Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>B. Price Evaluation. Lastly, the Government shall rank all technically acceptable quotations by total price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness, realism, and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>1. The maximum price limitation for each of CLINs 0001 and 0002 is not to exceed $35,000 per line item. Quotations exceeding this amount on one or both CLINs will not be considered for award of either CLINs.</p>
<p>C. After evaluation of both the Technical Requirements and Pricing Submission as specified in the solicitation, the Contracting Officer will select that responsible source whose quotation is technically acceptable, considering only the criteria included in the solicitation, and which offers the lowest evaluation price.</p>
<p>D. Quoters are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in Section L. Quoters may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quotation such as technical acceptability. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a purchase order without the opportunity for quotation revision.</p>
<p>E. The Government intends to award a purchase order without discussions with respective quoters. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. <br /><br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />CONST-M-7401 REJECTION OF OFFERS</p>
<p>(a) Offer on All: Offerors must propose on all item(s). Failure to do so shall be cause for rejection of offer. (Applies only to solicitations containing more than one (1) line item).</p>
<p>(b) Separate Changes: Separate changes in any form, are not solicited. Offers containing separate changes will be rejected.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />CONST-M-7402 EVALUATION AND AWARD OF CONTRACT</p>
<p>Evaluation and award will be made in accordance with FAR Provision 52.215-1, Instruction to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition. Since the Government intends to award a contract without discussions, offerors are cautioned to review carefully all terms and conditions, and specifications of the solicitation prior to proposal submission.</p>
<p>NOTE: Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the aggregate amount for all options to the cumulative total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). A proposal is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices that are significantly overstated for other work. Unrealistically low proposed costs/prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the Offeror does not understand the requirement or the Offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the information in FAR Subpart 12.6, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under the test program for commercial items found in FAR 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The United States Coast Guard (USCG) seeks to obtain Helicopter Support Services, including Medical Evacuation, for the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) in Greenland. Please see the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS) for further information.</p>
<p>This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-66 (April 1, 2013).</p>
<p>The North American Classification System Code is 481. Due to the overseas location, no set-aside will be used.</p>
<p>The Government will award one (1) Time and Materials (T&amp;M) Contract as a result of this solicitation to the vendor that represents the best value, utilizing the trade-off method. Best value trade-off will be based on the evaluation factors in descending order of importance as follows: (1) Technical Capability,&nbsp;(2) Price, and (3) Past Performance. When combined, Technical Capability is significantly more important than price. Where competing offers are evaluated as nearing equality of merit with regard to non-price factors, price will become relatively more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit Volumes 1-3 for this effort no later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST), May 14, 2014</span></strong>. There will be no exceptions to the time and date on which responses are due, unless determined otherwise by the Government.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume 1: Technical Capability</span></p>
<p>Offerors shall provide a detailed understanding of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and shall provide sufficient and detailed descriptions of the contractor's capability and experience with successful projects of comparable nature, scope and complexity. This volume must contain a rough order of magnitude by blade hour for each type of helicopter that may be used to meet the requirements of the PWS. The technical response shall not exceed ten (10) pages.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate each offeror's proposal based on the degree to which it presents a clear, detailed statement of the technical approach, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the services required in the PWS. Offerors demonstrating a thorough understanding of the requirements by the clarity and detail of the quotation will be most highly rated, as will offerors demonstrating a realistic ability to successfully exceed the PWS requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume 2: Price</span></p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a full price proposal in accordance with the requirements outlined in the PWS. Offerors may use Attachment 3, Pricing Schedule, as a guide; however, offerors are permitted to submit a pricing schedule detailing the following: flight hour rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expense, and profit in addition to a materials cost for aviation fuel that also is inclusionary of overhead, etc. The Government anticipates a discount and offerors are encouraged to offer further price reductions. The Government will evaluate the total overall price to determine price reasonableness.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Volume 3: Past Performance<br /></span><br />Offerors shall provide at least three (3) past performance project profiles demonstrating successful management and performance of work similar in nature, scope and complexity to that described in the PWS. An offeror without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not available, will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance and will receive a "Neutral" rating. The Government reserves the right to consider other past performance informational queries and databases to gather additional information.<br /><br />Please see attachments for further information regarding this opportunity:</p>
<p>Attachment 1 - Performance Work Statement <br />Attachment 2 - Terms and Conditions<br />Attachment 3 - Pricing Schedule</p>
<p>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.<br /><br />Any questions or clarification requests regarding any aspect of this RFP are due no later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) May 6, 2014</span></strong>. All questions or requests for clarifications shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Tirene Crowell via email at Tirene.Crowell@uscg.mil and the Contract Specialist, Nakenia Spruill via e-mail at Nakenia.S.Spruill@uscg.mil. Questions and answers will be issued as a solicitation amendment and accordingly available for viewing by all interested vendors.<br /><br />All proposals shall be submitted by e-mail to the contact information listed above with the subject line, "HSCG23-14-R-MAC009."</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to revise SECTION I, Funding Opportunity Description as follows. For ease of reading the entity section is included below. New information can be found in 4th paragraph below and also in the new technical area (5) added at the end of this section. Please note the specific due date for white papers for this area. No other changes have been made.
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force cyberspace must operate and be built upon a strengthened, trusted foundation that assures mission-essential functions across all Air Force missions, while being agile and resilient and providing the ability to avoid, fight through, survive and recover from advanced cyber threats.</p>
<p>The Trusted Systems Branch of the Information Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Rome Research Site, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for technologies to explore, research and develop innovative and potentially disruptive technologies that support trusted foundations/architectures for high assurance, secure, resilient systems, while increasing computational sophistication, capacity, and energy and cost performance efficiencies under constraints imposed by Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) trusted/secure systems and performance-requirement-driven layered information processing battlefield systems and networks. Additional innovative technologies are sought that will enable the engineering of secure and correct complex software-intensive systems resulting in trust, and migrate the analysis from execution to the design and development phases.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are technologies that support architectures for high assurance, trusted/secure architectures, increased computational sophistication, more complex system functionality with improved quality, dramatic improvements in the energy/performance/cost of systems, embedded processing and quantum information processing. Also of interest are technologies that can reduce warfighter decision latencies/response time, decrease system costs and system development times, automate labor-intensive/error-prone and costly aspects of system software development, and improve reliability, longevity, and usability of new and legacy military computing systems.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions; However, there is significant uncertainty about the DoD's Software Assurance (SwA) capability to achieve the level of confidence that software functions as intended (and only as intended) and remains free of vulnerabilities across legacy systems and systems being acquired. Any approach for Software Assurance must address vulnerabilities and weaknesses to cyber threats of the system as a whole from the beginnings of design and not be a piecemeal approach applied as an afterthought. Implementation must be top down; covering a risk based approach for the system itself as well as addressing supply chain management and enforcement. In the end, the approach must deliver a high level of assurance that the software system is self-contained, the data is verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy, executables protected while at rest, under execution, or in transit within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. While the solution space offers software-only or hardware-assisted data and executable protections, measuring and verifying assurance of the incorruptibility/trust is of utmost importance. Lastly, while the rapidly evolving threat environment requires a consistent approach to protecting our systems, it must also be agile, as it must be recognized that in most cases, a "one size fits all" solution will not work. Different types of applications have differing threat profiles, varying by criticality, threats, Software Assurance requirements and concerns (ie. web based application verse real-time embedded application verse flight/safety critical application verse development tools).</p>
<p>This effort will investigate the research, application and/or development of trusted/secure information processing architecture technologies, products and standards as they relate to the following technical areas:</p>
<p>(1) Development of appropriate information technology to enhance the processing capabilities of current and future Air Force C4I systems: This technical area encompasses all information processing technology, both hardware and software that could potentially contribute to enhancing the security, trustworthiness, functionality, performance, reliability, longevity, scalability, resiliency and usability of legacy or planned Air Force C4I processing systems. Examples of hardware technologies include multi-core processing architectures with emphasis on hardware support for semantic operations, power reducing/power management/power aware processing architectures, high assurance/trusted/secure processing architectures, data storage, performance optimization visualization tools, mobile and wireless networks and technologies necessary to achieve secure information processing. Examples of software technologies include High Performance Computing (HPC) programming languages both new and existing, data retrieval/mining, data management, data delivery, software/system monitors, publish/subscribe mechanisms, decision making techniques, distributed databases, static and dynamic runtime optimization and resource management.</p>
<p>(2) Trusted Software-intensive Systems Engineering: The objective of the trusted software-intensive systems engineering technical area is to develop techniques, methodologies and tools to guarantee trust (as measured by correctness, security, reliability, predictability, and survivability) and migrate the analysis from execution (testing and monitoring) to design (correct-by-construction and formal/security specifications) and development (composition and auto-generation of artifacts). Technical areas of interest include: techniques to enable trust in model-based software engineering; model-based engineering for predictable software attributes; provably correct code generation; evidence-based software assurance; trusted software and systems composability; modeling, analysis, and verification of autonomous software; mechanisms to fight through software failures; and software comprehension.</p>
<p>(3) Quantum Information Processing: This technical area includes one-way quantum computation using cluster/graphs states, measurement based quantum computation, quantum computing with an emphasis on the utilization of photon-based qubits, quantum algorithms employing cluster/graph states or quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computation, blind quantum computation, single-photon/entangled-photons on demand, quantum integrated optical waveguide circuitry, reduced measurement methodologies for quantum tomography of multi-qubit states.</p>
<p>(4) Secure, resilient and Trusted Computing Architectures: The objective of this technical area is to investigate the necessary building blocks for secure and resilient computing environments (environments where compelling evidence is supplied to determine a high level of trustworthiness), including both the underlying hardware and software to support it. Technical areas of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Problems and challenges with current processor designs for trustworthiness and their solutions;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Problems and challenges with current computer architectures for trustworthiness and solutions to them;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Operating System level constructs, objects, functions and distributions that must be provided to complement the hardware to enable a trustworthy computing base;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) State of the art software-based assurance designs, methodologies or concepts which are better suited for implementation in hardware than software. This technical area is also interested in research and development for increasing the level of trustworthiness of integrated circuit designs, commodity integrated circuits and currently available systems as a whole. Finally, this technical area is also interested in security enhancements possible in the software tool chain used for compiling and linking source code as well as research in the implications of state-of-the-art commercially available processor architectures and specially designed processor architectures that will enable delivery of trustworthy, secure and timely information.</p>
<p>(5) Software Assurance Framework: Achieving the degree of Software Assurance across the application space requires a holistic approach that agilely addresses all layers of the supply chain and enterprise including governance, partnerships, process, standards, and education. The objective of this area is to create the foundations of such a Software Assurance holistic approach including the CONOPS for an organizing entity that will classify and prioritize the use of relevant and continuously vetted tools to create a higher baseline in terms of systemic SwA for the DoD and its most critical Defense Industry Base (DIB) partners. The entity will focus on developing and monitoring adherence to an appropriate risk-based assessment framework for software assurance, aligning each class of software with appropriate depth and breadth of validation and verification tools. The initial domain for this topic is DoD embedded systems. Areas of interest include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Develop the Concepts of Operation (CONOPS) of a central SwA entity and requisite SwA Integrated Product Team. This will include, but is not limited to, the definition and plan for implementing the strategies, objectives, plans, procedures and roadmaps for a central Software Assurance entity within the DoD and an operational entity located at AFRL/RI Rome NY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) SwA Tools Assessment and Categorization- Perform baseline evaluation of initial toolsets to be used in the Software Assurance process. Define the appropriate depth and breadth of validation and verification tools for various classes of DoD embedded software providing a standardized set of the best and most appropriate tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Prototype Software Assurance Demonstration - Run a pilot demonstration on an exemplar program office code base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) SwA technology - seeks to advance the state of SwA at scale. Research in this area will address the technology gaps to improve SwA tools (e.g. precision and recall) and scalability (e.g. code size, expertise required, and execution time).</p>
<p>Responses for Technical Area (5) may address one or more of the areas of interest.</p>
<p><strong>Directions specific to the Software Assurance Framework technical area:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>i. Technical Areas (a), (b) and (c) will receive priority in funding. It is anticipated that one effort will be funded in each.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Awards will be no more than 12 months<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii. Typical awards will not exceed $1.5M<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv. For best chance of award please submit whitepaper by noon EST 9 June 2014.</strong></p>

<a href="mailto:trisha.fitton@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>*12 May 2014 Updates: <br>  <br> Recent pyrophoric 28-day Temperature and Humidity and Long Term Storage testing discovered material performance degradation and structural integrity issues.  Due to this new information, the Government will add Environmental & Storage as an element under the Technical evaluation of the Request For Proposal for the Low Velocity and High Velocity TP-DNT program. <br>  <br> Clarification for EUC submittals: <br> If the country in which your company is exporting your bid samples from requires an End User Certificate for Solicitations W15QKN-14-R-0038 40mm LV TP DNT and W15QKN-14-R-0039 40mm HV TP DNT, the quantity requested shall be 100 for LV and 128 for HV.  The USG will also not accept additional rounds above the USG requirement (100 for LV and 128 for HV).  Any offeror who requests additional quantities will be informed that the USG immediately does not concur with a request of this nature, and the Offeror shall resubmit their EUC request with the USG requirement quantity. <br>  <br> ATF Information: <br> Any offeror requiring import of an article from a foreign nation shall follow the ATF Guidebook - Importation & Verification of Firearms, Ammunition, and Implements of War as found on the following website to ensure that the importer has the correct ATF licenses/forms applicable to the importation process and transfer of items to USG (ATF Forms 6, 2 and 5):   <br>  <br> http://www.atf.gov/files/firearms/guides/importation-verification/download/firearms-imporation-verification-guidebook--complete.pdf <br>   <br> The offeror is reminded that all ATF license coordination is the responsibility of the offeror.  <br>  <br> Any questions surrounding what ATF paperwork is required shall be directed to the ATF Industry Liaison, Desiree M. Dickinson at 304-616-4584 or Desiree.M.Dickinson@usdoj.gov. <br>  <br> The Term  quote mark AMMUNITION quote mark  means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm. <br>  <br> Special attention is drawn to the following: <br>  <br> 1) An approved import permit on ATF Form 6, Application and Permit for Importation of Firearms, Ammunition and Implements of War, is required to import these articles into the United States and allows the importation of the articles listed on the form. A permit is valid for one year from its approved date. <br>   <br> 2)To obtain approval of submitted applications, the items to be imported must be correctly and completely identified on the ATF Form 6. In the case of new or unusual firearms, photographs and drawings of all markings should be submitted with the permit. It is strongly recommended that persons wishing to import firearms, ammunition, and defense articles first determine if the items are importable and then obtain an approved ATF Form 6 before acquiring the items abroad or attempting to bring them into the United States. Items may be conditionally imported pursuant to 18 U.S.C.   925(d) and/or 26 U.S.C.   5844. <br>  <br> 3) It typically takes the Firearms and Explosives Imports Branch (FEIB) personnel four to six weeks to process a properly executed ATF Form 6 import permit application. <br> Permit Application Tracking System One tracking method employed by importers involves the use and placement of an internal control number or optional number (as assigned by the Government) generated by the importers on the permit applications they submit. ATF encourages the use of internal control numbers or optional numbers by importers. Importers who elect to use an internal control numbers or optional numbers (composed of no more than 20 alpha-numeric characters) should place these numbers at the top of their ATF Forms 6 in the space entitled For Applicant's Optional Use. Our database will allow us to capture these unique numbers as a key field, and allows us to search for a given application the unique number established by the importer.  If the items will be utilized on a Government contract or solicitation please ensure to include the Contract or Solicitation Numbers on your paperwork. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> *This is an update to the EUC language published on 17 April 2014.  <br>    <br>  Any offeror requiring an End User Certificate (EUC) shall submit a request with the following information:  <br>  1. Request shall be submitted on contractor letterhead.  <br>  2. List of supplier(s) and prime contractor.   <br>  3. Description of item along with the quantity being shipped.  <br>  4. Rationale for why the EUC is being requested.  <br>  5. The number of days that the supplier's country requires a DVC  <br>    <br>  Please keep in mind that High Velocity and Low Velocity will be two separate solicitations and if the offeror plans to submit bid samples for each, then two EUC requests will need to be submitted. The applicable solicitation numbers are listed below. Please be sure to include the correct number in the EUC request. All requests must be staffed to the Army Acquisition Executive, Ms. Heidi Shyu.  The Government requests that all EUC requests be submitted by COB 03 May 2014.  Any EUC requests received after this date will not be valid grounds to extend the RFP closing date. The attached sample request letter is provided for your reference to further assist in this process and ensure the US Government has the information required to process the EUC.  <br>    <br>  High Velocity: W15QKN-14-R-0039  <br>  Low Velocity: W15QKN-14-R-0038  <br>    <br>  *A list of the 15 April 2014 Industry Day Attendees is now available under additional documents.   <br>      <br>   *Interface Control Drawings (ICDs) are available for both High and Low Velocity. These documents are available upon request with a signed DD2345.     <br>        <br>    *If the country in which you are exporting your bid samples from requires an End Use Certificate (EUC) or another type of import documentation, please submit your request and all required documentation to the Contracting Office POCs listed on slide 8 of the Industry Day 2 presentation as soon as possible. It is up to each company to determine what their country or their supplier's country requires to export to the US.

<DESC>This is a Special Notice for the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) relating to Solicitation No. W15P7T-14-R-5002, which serves as a notice to industry concerning procurement of Non-Developmental Item (NDI) products to meet the requirements of the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) system for Army Aviation.  SALT is intended as a two-channel software-defined, National Security Agency (NSA) Type 1 radio, consisting of Link 16 and Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW).  The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SALT requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.        <br>                <br>       For purposes of conducting source selection testing, the Offeror shall be required to provide at least three (3), but not to exceed five (5) production representative SALT units (e.g., radio, power amplifier(s) and components) at the same date and time when the Offeror proposal is due.  The production representative SALT units shall be configured to meet the requirements in the SALT Performance Requirements Document (PRD), plus any other equipment, operator training and documentation (e.g., up to two (2) days of operator training/equipment checkout at the Government SPAWAR Systems Center - Pacific labs; tamper, safety, and operation warnings; cables, cable drawings, Interface Control Documents (ICDs), remote controls) needed to interface to and facilitate the evaluation.        <br>                <br>       After contract award, a total of thirty (30) production representative SALT radios will be required for Government RDT&E activities (e.g., production qualification testing; reliability testing; waveform standards conformance testing and initial helicopter platform integration and SIL activities), with hardware deliveries to commence no later than sixty (60) days after contract award.        <br>                <br>       The Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is providing a draft of the solicitation for the Small Airborne Link 16 Terminal (SALT) for review and comment by industry. ACC-APG intends to host face-to-face meetings with industry sources in approximately two weeks from the date of this posting, and the details of the meetings will be posted by amendment to this notice.       <br>              <br>       ACC-APG is particularly interested in receiving comments and questions from industry as early as possible to facilitate consideration of items prior to issuance of a formal solicitation.  Industry sources are directed to review the Draft RFP for additional important information.        <br>              <br>       The Government will not consider developmental products, as market research has verified that the SANR requirements can be met using only NDI or modified NDI products.  The anticipated date for release of the formal RFP is approximately forty-five (45) days after release of the draft RFP, but this date may be subject to change.  A separate notice for the formal RFP will be posted with response dates and       <br>       instructions as applicable to this solicitation.       <br>              <br>       The Government's intent is to solicit and award, via full and open competition, a single Firm Fixed Price/Cost Plus Fixed Fee hybrid type contracts with a One-       <br>       Year base period and three (3) One-Year option periods for delivery of the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Full Rate Production (FRP) quantities of SALT systems, spares, and associated services.       <br>              <br>       It is the Government's intent to award a contract in a manner that results in the best value to Government using a trade off process.       <br>              <br>       Based on market research, the Government is not utilizing Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.       <br>              <br>       The above discussed intent is subject to change.       <br>              <br>       If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.       <br>              <br>       Formal communications related to this acquisition shall be submitted by email to rachel.p.bogner.civ@mail.mil or donald.w.morgan3.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of Market Research being conducted by the Mission and Installation Contract Command, Fort Eustis to gain knowledge and understanding of available training information capabilities, solutions and technology maturity able to support the possible acquisition of a new Army Training Information System, and if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside.  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).  The scope of interest encompasses all Active, National Guard and Reserve Component Soldiers, authorized education center users, counselors, Army organizations and units, elements from other services/agencies, Department of the Army (DA) Civilians, and to a lesser extent Army support contractors.  The Army Training Information System (ATIS) will enable training management, scheduling, development, resource management, content management.  Analysis of over 40 Army training information systems across multiple commands and civilian offices showed the need for improved training information systems architecture for the Army.  Sixteen training system architectural gaps were identified and determined to be primarily the results of a lack of a standards-based, data sharing environment.  Many existing systems lack appropriate data sharing capabilities and critical communication architecture features, relying on failing interfaces, and lacking configuration management which allows collecting and storing non-authoritative data in multiple databases.  These independent systems, hosted throughout the world, provide limited, redundant, and conflicting training information.  Many of these systems operate on closed, stand alone networks with proprietary software and interoperability issues that make modernization extremely complex.  The Army must improve the way it acquires, manages, and uses information resources technology to more efficiently support Army training and education (T&E) requirements through automation.  To improve the current situation, the Army has identified 3 high level objectives:  (1) Implement Sharing of Training Data, Information, and Services:  This objective requires a secured and interoperable information sharing enterprise environment that connects war fighting, business intelligence, operations and sustainment for Army training.  To achieve objective success, all information sharing between training systems and the required designated Interface systems will take place through formally managed web service interfaces.  (2) Streamline the Army Training Business Mission Area (BMA) Portfolio:  This requires evaluating the best of breed, developing a new system of systems, and incrementally fielding and collapsing the remaining systems into a Common Operational Environment and Joint Information Environment standards-based and compliant architecture.  (3) Improve Return on Investment:  This requires reducing expenditures on Army training information systems while improving army training capabilities and efficiencies through automation.    <br>  The Business Outcomes for achieving the High Level Objectives will be:  (1) A secure, standards-based information system that manages and shares training information and services across the entire Army training enterprise; (2) A single enterprise providing five (5) Army training capabilities, as described below:  <br>      a.  Training Enterprise Scheduling Capability: Provides the capability to schedule resources and personnel required to conduct individual and unit training.  This capability will interface with other ATIS capabilities and external authoritative data sources as needed.   <br>      b.  Training Development:  Provides the capability to create and manage products required to conduct individual and collective training.  This capability will interface with other ATIS capabilities and external authoritative data sources as needed.    <br>      c.  Content Management:  Provides the capability to store, manage, and deliver learning content for use across all three Army training domains (institutional, organizational and self-development).  Provides monitoring visibility progress from enrollment through completion.  This capability will interface with other ATIS capabilities and external authoritative data sources as needed.    <br>      d.  Training Management:  Provides the capability to enable the management of training, planning, preparation, and execution across all three Army training domains (institutional, organizational and self-development).  Provides ability to access and manage information, including individual and collective/unit training that supports mission tasks and individual training records.  This capability will interface with other ATIS capabilities and external authoritative data source as needed.    <br>      e.  Training Resource Management:  Provides the capability to manage and identify availability of training support resources.  Training support products include consumable and non-consumable resources (e.g., qualified instructors and support personnel, training aids, ammunition, ranges, training areas, etc.).  Provides ability to record resources consumed during training events.  Provides Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO) analysis, and reports capabilities.  Provides the ability to manage the availability and sustainability of training enablers and resources.    <br>  Most critical to ATIS is that it must be responsive to users at the point of delivery (classrooms, mobile devices, desktops) in support of the Army's mission to train as we fight.  The requirements of the proposed new system must be carefully defined and vetted with a wide and diverse community of users.  Successful implementation of the Army High Level Objectives and Business Outcomes provides a single enterprise-level services access point for all Army training.  Information system and data duplication will be eliminated; training data will be authoritative and normalized across the enterprise; and, the time and complexity it now takes to complete routine training tasks will be reduced.  In order to assess the applicability of different potential technical approaches, the Army requests that RFI responses include, but not necessarily be limited to, a brief description of recommended technical approaches; identification of past/ongoing successful implementation(s); and, the scalability and licensing model requirements of each approach.  Other areas of interest include typical transaction throughput, Technological Readiness level (TRL), and methods used to protect data privacy.  The requiring activity for this procurement is the Distributed Learning Systems (DLS), Newport News, VA.  A determination on the contract type, mechanism for procuring the services, and possible set-aside will not be made by the Government until after the market research has been completed.  No proposals are being requested or accepted under this synopsis.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541512 and the size standard is $25.5M.  Qualified companies are encouraged to respond.  Responses should provide the following information in response to this sources sought announcement:  (1) business name and address; (2) name of company representative and their business title; (3) pertinent details and experience of doing this type of services (identify any relationship with work conducted with the Government's Information Technology programs); (4) business size as it relates to the NAICS code and size standard stated in this sources sought announcement; (5) contract types typically used for these services; and (6) other contract vehicles that would be available to the Government for the procurement of these services, to include General Service Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedules; and/or any other Department of Defense contracts.  PROCEDURES:  This Request for Information (RFI) is a required component of a complete and systematic process to evaluate interested parties in order to minimize cost both to potentially interested parties and the Government.  Interested sources are also encouraged to submit product literature in response to this Request for Information (RFI).

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PRICE.  FACTOR #2: DELIVERY.  PRICE AND DELIVERY ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>New - Initial acceptance will be at the discretion of the acceptor during the delivery. All items required must be fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW. <BR> <BR>Delivery must be made within 30 day or less after receipt of order (ARO).

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following answers to questions submitted by&nbsp;interested vendors:<br /><br />Q1: Is it the goal of the FRA to have one rail network and does that network require the spatial alignment of the NARN within the FRA network?</p>
<p>A1: Yes, conflation will result in one network comprised of the FRA network and the NARN.</p>
<p>Q2: Does the FRA require the like the attributes of the FRA to remain within the data, or should a combination of attributes for like line segments (between the networks) be considered?</p>
<p>A2:The data dictionary of the FRA network will remain and add in additional attributes from the NARN. The attributes that are shared will be compared and when there are discrepancies, they will be flagged for future review.</p>
<p>Q3: Are additional attributes to be populated (or corrected) to the rail line features during the conflation process? Based on review of the sample data it appears that many of the rail lines in the FRA network exist for Abandoned lines but still contain attribution stating it is an Active Track (when compared to aerial imagery).</p>
<p>A3: Abandon tracks must be done through the STB. If there is track that is not active and there is no STB abandonment number to this location, they are marked as "X" for out of service.</p>
<p>Q4: It appears that there are many abandoned lines represented in the FRA network (that do not exist in the NA network). If the spatial location (which is more accurate in the NA) is to be used for conflation - how do you see these existing (abandoned) lines represented in the FRA network connected to the realigned locations? (Simply extended or trimmed at the new main locations intersections?)</p>
<p>A4: Abandon tracks will not be removed, they still provide value within the industry.</p>
<p>Q5: Will the chosen conflation team need to verify the track attribute? In the sample data it appears that the NARN represents a set of tracks with dual lines where the FRA only</p>
<p>A5: Yes, conflation means the spatial and attribution of both networks. In this case, the conflation will keep the dual lines.</p>
<p>Once again, FRA would like to stress that this RFI is an informational exchange performed to leverage industry's knowledge in order to better define and understand a potential procurement.&nbsp; Answers are provided to submitted questions in order to further enhance that process.&nbsp; Nothing that is submitted or not submitted in response to this RFI will have any bearing on a vendor's ability to compete on any potential future related acquisition.&nbsp; Any and all input is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<RESPDATE>052114
<CONTACT>John Penley, Acquisition Lead, Phone 2564503356, Email john.penley@mda.mil
<DESC>REVISED MAY 12, 2014: The response date for this Request for Information is extended through May 21, 2014 to accommodate vendors who were unable to access the initial notice.  Furthermore, the attached table is revised to correct an erroneous title for task order DA-01.  No other changes are effected with this amended notice.

The purpose of this announcement is to post a Request for Information (RFI) notice only. This RFI is for informational planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.

The Missile Defense Agency's (MDA) mission is to develop and deploy a layered, ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend the United States, its deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attacks of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agency Engineering and Support Services (MiDAESS) Program Office is developing a future acquisition strategy for the Agencys Acquisition, Engineering, and Support Services with the emphasis on identifying an acquisition strategy that provides the best value to the Agency in terms of technical capability coupled with improved costs. The current Acquisition, Engineering, and Support services contract, commonly referred to as MiDAESS, is an ID/IQ contract grouped in the following functional capability groups (FCGs): (1) Quality, Safety, and Mission Assurance Support, (2) Acquisition Support, (3) Engineering Support, (4) Infrastructure and Deployment Support, (5) Agency Operations Support, (6) Security and Intelligence Support, and (7) Agency Advisory Analytical Support (Note: the attached table provides a detailed breakout of existing MiDAESS requirements by FCG, functional organization, and task order).

This RFI is issued to solicit input from industry on any changes (ranging from minor "tweaks" to wholesale re-alignments) in the alignment of scopes of work that would benefit both industry and the Agency through increased competition, lower costs, and improved support. This is not a request for inputs on the type of contract or contracts to be awarded but instead is a focused effort to identify work groupings for improvements in competition. The Government is interested in industrys recommendations in changes to work scope or groupings that would provide a better basis for industry to develop and compete for contract and/or task order awards.

Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response. The Government will not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly marked and clearly identified. Proprietary information received in response to this request for information will be safeguarded and handled in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Missile Defense Agency will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future acquisition.

The Missile Defense Agency is requesting information via e-mail with Windows compatible email
attachment on or before May 21, 2014 to MIDAESS2014@mda.mil. Responses are limited
to no more than 3 pages, 8-1/2 x 11; use 12 inch font.

Questions concerning this RFI should be addressed to Ms. Lynn Washburn, Competition
Advocate, at Lynne.Washburn@mda.mil. Responses must be sent to MIDAESS2014@mda.mil
in order to be considered.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has a requirement for site surveys to produce assessments of the capability of USMC shore stations to host and support the maintenance, supply support, storage, and operational requirements of VMU squadrons operating the RQ-21A and RQ-7B. The results of the assessments will be documented in Site Evaluation Reports (SERs) or Site Activation Support Plans (SASPs) as applicable. This effort is for the continuation of this study which was previously performed by TSI. NAWCAD intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract to TSI 816 Greenbrier Circle, Suite 208, Chesapeake, VA 23320. TSI has the knowledge of concept of operations of VMU squadrons within the context of the Marine Corps Aviation Plan (AvPlan) and facility support requirements as delineated in the Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC). As such, this is a logical follow-on to contract N00421-08-D-0013. To award to another source would create duplication of cost and schedule delays for another offeror to gain the historical knowledge and expertise required to evaluate, assess, and make recommendations on the feasibility of the potential places to relocate the VMU squadrons operating the RQ-21A and RQ-7B within the required 10 month schedule. As a result, the Government intends to negotiate with TSI on an other than full and open competitive basis to procure these assessments and plans.</p>
