C.	SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

The incumbent will be expected to work independently, take initiative, and be responsible for advising on all aspects of USAID and some U.S. Government (USG) supported DG activities.  In carrying out specific assignments, the incumbent will work closely, as requested, with representatives from The Republic of Yemen Government (ROYG), international donor organizations, local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and USG officials at the US Embassy/Sanaa, USAID/Egypt and USAID/Washington.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

There is a pressing need to support democratization and to increase its credibility in Yemen.  Democratic governance is essential to both the economic growth that Yemen desperately needs and to manage the conflicts that threaten to destabilize its internal equilibrium.  It is therefore imperative for the USG to prioritize activities to encourage Yemens movement towards increased democracy and governance by strengthening representative institutions and the capacity and roles of their reform-minded members, and supporting more representative participation and a more representative environment.

IR 1.0, Representative Institutions Strengthened, corresponds to USAID/Yemens core DG activities that address key development challenges in the DG sector and directly support other elements of the USAID development program in Yemen.  Activities under IR 1.0 focus on the roles, capacity, processes and interrelationships among members of parliament, local councils, line ministries and community organizations and include the allocation and oversight of funds in the national and local fiscal process.

IR 2.0, Opportunities for Increased Democracy and Governance Supported, provides a mechanism for USAID/Yemen to address targets of opportunity jointly agreed to by Embassy/Sanaa and USAID/Yemen that are funded by bilateral Economic Support Funds (ESF) allocations to USAID/Yemen, and are cleared by USAID/ANE.   Activities under IR 2.0 focus on anti-corruption efforts, political parties, civil society, women, elections, media and communications, rule of law and tribal conflict.

The DG SpO8 will maintain the cross-cutting theme of special attention to the needs and empowerment of women that is a key objective throughout the USAID Interim Strategy for Yemen.  USAID/Yemen plans to submit for approval a new Strategic Statement during the summer of 2006, which will include a DG Strategic Objecvtie (SO).  This new proposed DG program is anticipated to receive an estimated amount of $3-$5 million in annual funding over the next 3-5 years of ESF plus significant added funds from USAID/DCHA/DG, MEPI, and the MCC.
