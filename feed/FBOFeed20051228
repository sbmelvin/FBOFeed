(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DSCP, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.
(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DSCP Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.
(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.
(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:
NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                             ].
COMPONENT IDENTIFY:                                [                             ].
NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].
* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:
NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY:   [                            ].
COMPONENT IDENTIFY:                                  [                            ].

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.
(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<DESC>The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Force’s acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE code Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your company’s security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted to the contracting officer via email to annabel.rivera@brooks.af.mil.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the building modernization of the Potter Stewart U.S. Post Office and Courthouse located on 100 E. Fifth Street in Cincinnati, Ohio.  The estimated total construction cost for the project is $25-35 million.   The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin June 2006. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project. 

This project is the second phase of the modernization of the courthouse.  The project's scope of work consists of considerable exterior repair, including window replacement and glazing, tuck-pointing, replacement of the main roof, and structural areaway repairs.  This phase of the project will also complete the lobby renovation, the historic renovation of the public spaces on the upper floors, and the renovation of all public restrooms in the building.  An additional district court room and support space will be constructed on the first floor.  All generators and motors will be replaced in the passenger elevators; all motors, controls, and cables will be replaced in the freight elevators.  Nonfunctioning chillers, cooling towers, pumps, tanks, and associated equipment will be removed.  Additional building repairs will be completed, such as the installation of an emergency diesel generator and switchgear, the extension of the existing sprinkler system, the abatement of asbestos under the east ramp area and the building pipe chases, and the insulation of this area.  The boiler plant will be replaced and a new Judge's Chambers, Grand Jury Suite, and U.S. Attorney Satellite Office will be constructed.     

The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Preconstruction phase services with the Construction phase services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option. This will be a firm, fixed-price contract. A firm, fixed-price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option. 

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value Trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and developing construction sequencing activities.  During the design phase, the CMc will be responsible for developing construction cost estimates and costs related to future project consultants.  GSA also intends to have the contractor perform other services including evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phases of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interests, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work. The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project and shall have a full understanding of the project, the contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

The Construction phase services (Option) of this project shall include, but are not limited to administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc's internal personnel or under subcontract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, commissioning and other required LEED services.  The CMc shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.  During the construction phase, the CMc will be responsible for providing warranties on all completed work and for providing construction materials in a timely manner to complete the job on schedule and under budget.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst (NAWCADLKE) intends to procure a mobile landbased Heavy Maintenance Crane (HMC).  The government plans to replace the existing 8 ½ ton wheel-mounted maintenance cranes, Navy designation A/S32M-14 and A/S32M-17 with the new HMC.  The current Fleet shorebased cranes support the following aircraft systems:  AV-8, C-130, CH-53, V-22, E-6, P-3 and H-46.  They are used for aircraft maintenance and component removal and replacement (engines, transmissions, propellers, rotor blades, etc.).  The following are some of the requirements for the new mobile landbased HMC:  The new HMC shall be a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)  or a modified COTS item.

The COTS HMC shall have the following minimum lift capacity: 12,000 lbs at an outreach of not less than 13 ft clear from the frame of the crane (not center of rotation) with a hook height of not less than 26 ft.  The new HMC shall have a telescopic boom, be wheel-mounted with 2 and 4 Wheel Drive and 4 Wheel Steer capability, and weigh less than or equal to 45,000 lbs.  As required for any typical Navy Support Equipment (SE), the new HMC shall be highly reliable, maintainable, and supportable.   The new HMC shall be capable of meeting environmental, EMI, mobility requirements, and 3600 swing (slewing/rotating) criteria.  Human factors engineering shall be utilized to the greatest extent possible to make the new HMC a “user friendly” piece of SE.  It is anticipated that the contract will be a multi-year IDIQ contract where during the first year, the contractor shall be required to provide a minimum of 2 pilot-production units for pre-production testing and government suitability and supportability evaluation/approval, as well as the associated technical and logistics data. After successful completion of all testing, the government plans to issue delivery orders for up to approximately 70 production units. The planned maximum quantity in any calendar year is 25 HMCs.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil. Select ‘Doing Business’ and then ‘Open Solicitations.’ Look for amendments on the web page.

<DESC>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide training and human capital services and solutions to a large number of Federal Government agencies through OPM’s Training and Management Assistance (TMA) Branch. For more than 20 years, OPM has used TMA as a resource to help Federal agencies accomplish a variety of training and human capital management projects, specifically in support of human capital development and organizational performance improvement.




The proposed acquisition will be solicited using Full and Open Competition procedures. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a responsive technical and price proposal by the closing time and date of the RFP. OPM anticipates awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts that allow for firm fixed price delivery orders.

The resulting performance-based contracts will enable OPM to successfully support its client agencies in improving the proficiency of their workforces, the structures and business processes of their organizations, and the effectiveness with which they fulfill their missions and objectives. Every effort will be made by the TMA program office to work with customer agencies to develop performance-based statements of work, as appropriate, for each task to be negotiated and awarded under each of the TMA contracts. The projects will be awarded primarily through task order competitions among the qualified firms by virtue of their selection for an IDIQ award. 

The TMA program provides support in two (2) service areas:

1.  Custom Training and Learning Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of instructional products regardless of subject area. Some examples of products and services under this key service area include: instructor-led materials; print-based instructional materials; technology-based training products; job aids; performance support strategies and tools; knowledge management systems; learning organization strategies; consulting; learning systems development and integration; and training management systems. Some technology-based training will be developed using Government-adopted software and systems.

2.  Custom Strategic Human Capital Solutions.
Provide government agencies support in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and/or evaluation of strategies and systems that align human resources management with an agency’s mission and that manage, appraise, compensate, and retain a high-quality and diverse workforce. Some examples of services under this key service area include: strategic human resources planning; human resources system development and integration; consulting; business process reengineering; compensation; performance management; performance measurement and improvement; program management support; and program evaluation.

The RFP will allow offerors to submit proposals for either one or both of these service areas.
 
Place of Performance: Most projects will require contractor performance in the Washington, D.C. metro area. However, TMA does service client agencies wherever they may be located, to include sites outside the continental U.S. 

Duration of the contract period: The period of performance includes a 12 month base period plus four 12-month option periods.

Offeror Question Submissions: OPM will accept and answer questions from offerors after the RFP has been released. All questions will be answered in an amendment to the RFP to allow all interested offerors access to the same information.  The RFP will provide an outline of the procedures for submitting questions.

Pre-Proposal Conference: OPM intends to host a pre-proposal conference not later than two (2) weeks after release of the RFP. The date and time of the conference will be announced when the RFP is released. The location is anticipated to be in the D.C. Metro area.  The pre-proposal conference will provide potential offerors with an overview of the TMA program. You are strongly encouraged to attend this conference. Attending the conference will familiarize you with our operations, infrastructure and business processes, and should help you prepare a more responsive proposal. At least two days prior to the conference, you must email to the OPM point of contact a notice of your intent to attend. Each bidder will be limited to two attendees. Due to security concerns, offerors failing to register will not be allowed to attend. When registering for the conference, all offerors must provide the following information:

1.  Your company name.
2.  Single company point of contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address.
3.  Your company website address.
4.  List of attendees (total number of your staff expected to attend the conference, first and last names, titles, social security numbers, U.S. citizenship status (yes or no), telephone, fax, email, and mailing addresses.
5.  Your NAICS code.
6.  Your company business size/type (based on NAICS code above).  This will allow companies to make teaming arrangements if desired.  
7.  One-page executive summary of your company (including a general overview of the services and products you offer) in MS Word format.

After we receive your registration information, we will email your company point of contact a pre-proposal conference registration packet. The packet will include information related to directions to our facility, hotel/lodging, transportation, special accommodations, and a sample agenda.

Procurement Timeline: We anticipate issuing the solicitation on or about January 15, 2006. Proposals will be due on or about March 1, 2006. Our award decision will be based on a best value determination.

Evaluation Process: OPM intends to award contracts to responsible offerors whose proposals provide best value to the Government. Proposals must meet the terms and conditions of this solicitation prior to being evaluated in terms of the technical factors and subfactors.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

1.  Implementation costs for migrating the first group of 1010 accounts from Lotus Domino to Microsoft Exchange, considering the requirements above.  Potential respondents shall also identify how the costs were calculated.

2.  A per seat cost to operate and maintain the system at a service level of 99.99% and an alternate per seat cost for a service level of 99.95%.  Potential respondents shall also identify how the costs were calculated.

<DESC>The Air National Guard (ANG) requests information on three types of equipment to augment the fuels systems maintenance process.  The ANG is specifically looking for equipment to aid fuel leak detection, aid in sealant removal, and equipment to accele rate sealant cure time.  Companies may submit information on any one, two, or all three types of equipment.  For the purposes of this RFI no constraints of fuels maintenance equipment are levied except as noted in the following requirements: For fuel leak detection equipment: 1. The equipment shall have the capability to detect and identify the exact location/s of both internal and external fuel leaks with a high degree of accuracy (well beyond the current Air Force fuels shop air pressure, soap bubble, and powder dye procedure s) and have a very low to non existent false identification rate. For sealant removal equipment: 1.  The equipment/tool shall have the capability to quickly and safely remove old sealant from F-16 fuel tanks.  The tool should be usable in small and hard to reach areas. For fuel sealant cure equipment: 1.  The equipment shall have the capability to accelerate the curing process of PR1750 and PR1826 B ¼, B ½, and B 2 sealant.  The current cure times in 72 degree ambient air are; B ¼ 2 hours, B ½ 22 hours, B 2 32 hours).  The equipment must cut cure time b y at least 30%, however at least 50% reduction is desired. For leak detection, sealant removal, and sealant cure equipment: 1.  The equipment shall be of suitable size for use in tight spaces in F-16 and other fighter aircraft fuel tanks. 2.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur.

As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ)] for one (1) year of maintenance and service of servo-hydraulic equipment per the folllowing SOW: This contract is to cover maintenance, repair and calibration for the 50+ Government –owned MTS test frames at Glenn Research Center.  This equipment resides in the Materials and Structures Division and is used for testing for materials characterization and life prediction modeling for the various programs supporting Space and Aeronautics.	Research involving this equipment often involves the utilization of these machines at their resolution limits.  Therefore, these machines must function according to their design specifications. The test equipment covers a wide range of machines including, but not limited to, servohydraulic, electromechanical and screwdriven machines.  The majority of these rigs are 20 and 50 kip uniaxial test systems.  There are also several axial/torsion, high cycle frequency, and custom-built high frequency/low frequency test rigs.  These rigs are controlled by various MTS controllers such as models 448 and 458 analog systems as well as TestStar and FlexTest digital controllers.  An equipment list is available upon request. This contract will provide service for maintaining the proper operation of these test rigs.  This will include  the rebuilding of servovalves and actuators, repair/replacement of electronic boards, tuning of test rigs, and other necessary repairs to ensure the proper functioning of these rigs.  The term “rigs” constitute the load frame, controller, sensors, hydraulic pumps and lines, gripping system, environmental chambers, heating systems, and ancillary equipment, which may include any device connected to the rig and used to conduct the test.  The contractor shall provide original MTS parts for	the replacement of defective components to maintain the original design specifications and capabilities of the rig.  The contractor shall also maintain a spare parts inventory for the majority of the replacement parts such that minimal down-time is required at NASA.  The contractor shall also have the ability to manufacture unique components required for the rigs and produce them out of the correct choice of materials. The contractor shall also provide calibration services as requested by NASA.  This may include calibration of LVDTs, RVDTs, extensometers, and load cells under static and dynamic conditions, as well as aligning the load train.  All calibration standards and equipment used for this purpose shall be NIST traceable.  The contractor shall be compliant with the requirements in ANSI/NCSL Z540-1 and ISO 9001.  Also, all load cell calibrations shall be done in the load frame without disturbing the grips, cross-head, or load-train alignment unless otherwise permitted by NASA. The contractor shall provide software support for the MTS-supplied, Government-owned software packages and provide software upgrades and training for these packages as requested by NASA. Since NASA repairs some of the rigs themselves and adapts ancillary sensors and equipment to the test rigs, the contractor shall provide assistance over-the-phone to aid NASA researchers in interfacing this equipment with the MTS controllers and load frames.  For repairs that are not handled by NASA personnel, the contractor shall send a serviceman to fix the problems on the rigs.  The serviceman shall have at least two years experience diagnosing and repairing failures of MTS test rigs.  The serviceman shall be capable of diagnosing both system and component level failures. Since NASA does not have the proprietary drawings for the MTS equipment and since tight tolerances are required for many of the parts, the contractor shall provide evidence that they are trained and certified to repair MTS equipment.  This contract shall be similar to the Value Payment Plan offered by MTS. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-01.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541990 and $6 million respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Period of Performane shall be one (1) year.
