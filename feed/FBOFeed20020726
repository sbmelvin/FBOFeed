Specialized knowledge in the areas of electromagnetic field theory, signal analysis, and stochastic processes is required for completion of this task. Innovative Consulting is uniquely qualified to provide the services required in this order as they provided primary support for the initial development of the Near-Field Electromagnetic Propagation In Conductive Media –EXCEL Workbook Users Guide. Any other contractor would be required to duplicate a significant amount of this previous work in order to establish the knowledge base that Innovative Consulting has, which it is estimated would increase  the cost by 50%.

The Government plans to issue a request for written quote to Pickering Interfaces using FAR Part 12 and FAR Part 13. The anticipated award date is 14 Aug 02. The action is being processed on a Sole Source basis due to the fact that the system requires the utilization of specialized boards to conduct critical acoustic measurements. Pickering Interfaces is the only company capable of providing instrumentation that can measure to the degree necessary for our arrays. Any substitution in equipment would require restructuring the entire hardware and software development program. Any Company that believes it has the capability to meet the Government's minimum requirements is invited to submit a quote for Government evaluation. All proposals from responsible sources will be considered. Telephone requests will not be honored. The NAICCS code is 334515. Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/.

<DESC>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with BAE Systems, 305 Richardson Road, Lansdale, PA with a ceiling amount of $4,494.610. The BOA will cover a three-year period with two one-year options and include line items for evaluation, repair and upgrade of Shop Repairable Assemblies installed in the Navy’s ALQ-99 Band 9/10 Transmitter. Procurements under the BOA will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed process information, acceptance test procedures, technical requirement documents, failure analysis data and test stations in addition to the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government’s requirements. This synopsis will fulf ill the BOA requirement to issue a synopsis for job orders on an annual basis. POC for information regarding this requirement is Ms. Diane L. Pearson, telephone 812-854-5201, fax 812-854-3805 or email pearson_d@crane.navy.mil; email request is preferred. Proposed BOA will be issued on or about 9 August 2002. Numbered notes 22 and 26 apply.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2001-07). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 Employees.  (See Numbered Notes 12 and 13). LINE ITEM SUMMARY:  (Line Item Number 0001:  Histochemical Analysis Services of 100 retina's from seventy five (75) Kokanee Salmon, this includes tests/analysis, draft report, and final report-1 Job @ $__________ =  $__________.).  (Please provide a breakdown of all costs associated with this job).  GENERAL:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Fisheries Applications Research Group, has a requirement for Histochemical Analysis of Physiological Damage to Retina's of Kokanee Salmon by High Intensity Strobe Lights, this includes an analysis of the effects of strobe light energy on the optical physiology of Kokanee Salmon at short distances and a variety of durations.  WORK TO BE PERFORMED BY CONTRACTOR: The contractor shall perform the following services:  (a) Provide 75 Kokanee Salmon collected from natural environments, or if from cultured stock, they will have been cultured under natural day/night light conditions.  These fish must be adults between 8 and 16 inches long.  Half of these fish must be assigned to a treatment group, and half to a control. Purchase and transportation of salmon to the testing facility shall be the contractors' responsibility. Fish shall be held in the contractors' aquatic facility for holding and testing, (b) Each fish treated with strobe lights must be tranquillized and restrained a specified distance from the light source, nominally 12 inches, 1 yard and 2 yards, from the light for 5-9 fish.  Duration will nominally be 30 seconds, 1 and 2 minutes, this will allow for a total of 9 tests as follows:  12 inches for 30 seconds (test # 1), 12 inches for 1 minute (test # 2), 12 inches for 2 minutes (test # 3), 1 yard for 30 seconds (test # 4), 1 yard for 1 minute (test # 5), 1 yard for 2 minutes (test # 6), 2 yards for 30 seconds (test # 7), 2 yards for 1 minute (test # 8), 2 yards for 2 minutes (test # 9).  The tranquilization of the fish will allow detailed control in distance and time of exposure.  One eye at a time must be exposed, (c) Perform Density measurements and morphological measurements must be conducted with a microscope and image digitizing software to quantify and record data. All histochemical supplies, computers and software shall be provided by the contractor, (d) Hybridization with antibodies must be assessed against heat-shock proteins, visual pigments, or proliferation markers and examination of changes in expressions of particular proteins and changes in patterns of retinal growth will be indicators of environmental stress, and (e) Measure light transmission properties through the lens of exposed and control fish and perform microspectrophotometric analysis of visual pathways on at least 2 fish per test set.  In addition the contractor shall measure the spectral output of the strobe lights used in the tests. Tests/Analysis shall be completed by October 31, 2002.  GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED MATERIALS/SERVICES:  The Bureau of Reclamation will provide the underwater strobe lights and power converter for the test duration, and a light operator for one week of testing.  SUMMARY OF DELIVERABLES:  All data from the fish retina will be entered into a spreadsheet based software with links to the associated digitized image on CD ROM.  Data will be statistically analyzed with the null hypothesis that there is no effect on the retina of Kokanee salmon by exposure to underwater strobe light.   A list of data and associated images and a progress report describing techniques and analysed results shall be provided to the Denver Fisheries Application Group biologists as follows:  (a) A draft report shall be delivered no later than December 15, 2002 (b) The Bureau of Reclamation then will return Draft Report to Vendor by December 30, 2002 (c) The final report shall be delivered no later than January 15, 2003.

<CONTACT>Cara Castle, (919) 549-4311
<DESC>NA RFP DAAD19-02-R-0008 POC Richard, etc. Title:  Support Infrastructure for the Army High Performance Computing Research Center  The US Army has made a significant investment in basic and applied research utilizing High Performance Computing (HPC) and its application as well as the infrastructure to support such research.  This was underscored by the establishment, in 1989, and the continued sustainment thereafter  of the Army High Performance Computing Research Center (the Center), at the University of Minnesota. Army investments in HPC have resulted in the increasing utilization of computer based modeling and simulation by the Army  scientific and engineering community.  These investments have also created a steady source of well-trained scientists and engineers in this critical area.  The establishment of the Center was and shall continue to be the embodiment of the Army's support o f the broader national effort to maintain U.S. leadership in computing technology and its application to issues critical to U.S. national security. The Army High Performance Computing Research Center Program, hereinafter called “the program,” consists of two components:  (1) a research component in computational sciences and engineering and (2) an infrastructure support component.  The research compon ent is being performed under a cooperative agreement that was awarded in August 2001 to the University of Minnesota and a team of partner institutions comprised of the University of North Dakota and Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Ins titutions (HBCU/MIs); that include Clark Atlanta University, Florida A&M University, Howard University, and Jackson State University. The research component covers three technical research areas related to computational sciences and engineering, which incl ude:  Interdisciplinary Computational Research (i.e. research involving more than one scientific discipline); Algorithms and Software Technology; and Enabling Technologies.   This synopsis describes the intent of the Army to issue a solicitation for the establishment of a contract for the continuation of the infrastructure support component. Currently, Network Computing Services (NCS), Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota is under cont ract for the support infrastructure component of the program.  The infrastructure support component effort consists of (1) operating, maintaining and supporting existing HPC resources with security considerations; (2) identifying, acquiring, installing and  integrating novel HPC resources; developing and administering a Staff Scientist Program to support university researchers under the cooperative agreement and also Army scientists; and promoting technology exchange through training, publications and other outreach efforts to exploit HPC resources. The contractor is required to provide a core site to house the HPC resources (except for those HPC resources located at the cooperative agreement partner institutions.)  The Government will deliver the existing HPC resources to the successful offeror.  The  contractor will be responsible for, and must assume the cost of, preparing the core site and installing and integrating these HPC resources into an operational computing environment. The HPC resources to be operated, maintained and supported include: a 10 88 node SGI/Cray T3E-1200E (located at the facility of the current contractor, NCS); IBM RS/6000 SPs located one each at Clark Atlanta, Florida A&M, Howard and Jackson State Universities and a Cray SV1ex at Jackson State University. All these systems are l inked via a private T-1 network. The environment is connected to the Defense Research and Engineering Network by a DS-3 link. The graphics and visualization facilities are connected to the T3E by high speed fiber optic based networks.  The SGI/Cray T3E-120 0E and the visualization facilities are operated with centralized configuration management.  [NOTE:  A complete listing of the HPC resources to be provided a s Government Furnished Property (GFP) under the resulting contract will be included in the solicitation.  This listing will include the GFP at the cooperative agreement partner institutions identified above.] These systems have the same operating policies,  security policies, username structure, accounting procedures/reports, and systems administration philosophy.   All systems support HPF, Fortran 90, MPI and a common debugger.  Portability of applications from one system to another requires little or no re -programming effort or user retraining.  Access to the systems is provided through user-generated scripts or a web-based interface.   Computing systems are required to be operated and available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, less scheduled and unsche duled maintenance. Network and systems support staff are provided on-site and on-call to deal with issues expediently as they arise. The contractor will be required to have a Secret facility clearance. Users are required to have successfully completed a Na tional Agency Check (NAC).  Also under this contract, the contractor shall be required to identify, procure, install and integrate, novel/new High Performance Computing (HPC) hardware/software.   The contractor shall be required to provide high level staff scientists to support Army researchers and scientists in exploiting the research performed under the cooperative agreement.  Staff scientists must have advanced degrees in technical disciplines, e.g. computer science, physical sciences, chemistry, engineering with specialized expertise in High Performance Computing.  Expertise is required to be in one or more of the following: advanced algorithmic development and/or modeling in their respective sp ecialized computational areas; programming including parallel and object oriented; HPC enabling technologies; and scientific visualization on state-of-the-art scalable systems.  The contractor shall be required to promote technology exchange through, training, publication, education and other outreach efforts to exploit the HPC resources.    This acquisition is being conducted using full & open competition, resulting in the award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which task orders will be issued for the required effort.  Task Orders may be issued on a Cost-Pl us-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) or Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) basis.  The period of performance for the contract will be four years with a ceiling amount of $98,000,000.00. Award will be made on a best value basis, with award to the offeror whose proposal is considered mo st advantageous to the Government.  Formal source selection procedures will be used for this acquisition.  The solicitation will be posted to http://www.aro.army.mil/research/index.htm#fund on or about 13 August 2002.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held Tuesday, 27 August 2002, 10:00am local time, at the current contractor’s facility (NCS), in Minneapolis, MN.  The purpose of this conference is to provide potential offerors an opportunity to view the existing HPC resources under the current contract and the current support infrastructure component operations.  Information will also be provided concerning the  research component.   Potential offerors must pre-register with the Contract Specialist, Richard Burkes, by 22 August 2002 in order to attend this conference.

The estimated value of the System Integrator acquisition is over 400 million dollars and the performance period is expected to last through FY2005.

**Network**  CCSP Network will implement modifications to the existing Pentagon network infrastructure.  CCSP Network will acquire enhanced network security components, network services, networking components, passive infrastructure, and facilities/utilities work to support the required network modifications.  The effort needed to implement these network modifications include project management, engineering and integration activities.  CCSP Network is actually four enterprise networks with a separate network classified at SBU, Secret, Top Secret, and SCI.  CCSP Network activities will address the following four functional areas: Core, Distribution, Access and a single integrated Network Management System.  The integration of CCSP Network will be a significant technical challenge involving the integration of different IT systems (Voice, Mainframes, and Data Messaging) and the replacement of various generations of legacy networking equipment.  As part of the integration effort, all CCSP Network active components must be able to be monitored and controlled from the existing Network Systems Management Center and from an Alternate Network Systems Management Center.

**Voice**  CCSP Voice includes major telephone switch engineering and installation efforts.  The requirements will address survivability modifications for the Pentagon administrative voice telephone system, diverse and redundant voice circuits (trunks), and redundant voice telephone capabilities, infrastructure, critical end user devices (e.g., telephones), and facilities/utilities.

**Mainframe/Server**  CCSP Mainframe/Server includes extensive engineering and installation efforts for mainframe/server communications, diverse and redundant communications circuits (trunks), and acquisition and installation of redundant mainframe processors, memory and direct storage components and modules, storage area network components for data archiving and critical remote access, infrastructure, and facilities/utilities work supporting the mainframe/server and critical DoD application systems required for survivability.

**Contracting Information**  This acquisition will be accomplished in two phases.  In Phase I, a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) will be issued to all interested parties through full and open competition.  Once submitted, Qualifications will be evaluated against criteria established in the RFQ.  Based upon evaluation results, the Government will down-select to up to three offerors, who will participate in Phase II.  In Phase II, a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued to the successful Phase I offerors.  The RFP will contain a Statement of Objectives (SOO) instead of a performance-based statement of work.  As part of their proposal, Phase II offerors will be tasked to develop and submit a Performance-Based Statement of Work, laying out their proposed approach for satisfying the government's requirements for the CCSP Integration effort.  The Government anticipates conducting a pre-proposal conference for the Phase II offerors only.  Proposals will be evaluated against criteria established in the RFP.  Discussions will take place if necessary and one offeror will be selected for award.  Based on the availability of funds, unfunded options will be included in the contract.  Interested potential offerors will be required to have facility and individual security clearances in order to review technical data necessary for proposal preparation in Phase II.  This Program involves four classification levels.  Parties interested in receiving the Phase I RFQ may send a request for the RFQ via e-mail to CCSP@army.pentagon.mil, with "Request for CCSP RFQ" in the subject line.  Questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to CCSP@army.pentagon.mil, with "CCSP Questions" in the subject line.  The Government anticipates issuing the Phase I RFQ approximately 30 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, CCR Core Fluorescence Imaging Facility, Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression intends on entering into a sole source contract with CDM Optics, Inc., 4001 Discovery Drive, Suite 390-A5, Boulder, CO 80303 for an Wavefront Coded Retrofit Kit (Extended Focus) with additional upgrades.  The Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression studies the time lapse of living cells.  The CDM Optics Wavefront Coded Retrofit Kit will allow researchers the ability to view the whole cell in a single image and therefore, cells may be imaged faster and less exposed to fluorescence light.  Time lapse studies being performed in the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression studies are of two kinds: a long time lapse that allows studies of proteins during the cell cycle, and a fast short time lapse that allows the researcher to observe the rapid movements of the fluorescently tagged cellular organelles and proteins.  Problems occurring during long time lapse are in viability and bleaching of the cells caused by extensive irradiation; and fast short time lapse are slow speed of acquisition due to the fact that each time point several images are required to keep the structure in focus.  The CDM Optics Wavefront Coded Retrofit Kit will relieve the Laboratory of these problems by allowing just one image instead of 5-10, thus the exposure is reduced 5 times and the speed of acquisition is increased 5 times.  CDM Optics Inc., is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above requirments with these unique features.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statements msut be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EST on July 31, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 5.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to ths notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI),Applied Research Program (ARP) plans to procure the services of Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Center for Health Studies, 1730 Minor Avenue, Suite 100, Seattle, Washington 98101.  This request for supplies/services is being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $5M.   There is a growing need to automate survey collection and centralize health information that serves the needs of multiple care providers. Surveys provide a source of health information but contain both static and changing information.  The challenge is to accumulate a full set of information and update the parts that will change so that there is a valid accurate source of information for people who need to know and care for an individual. The purpose of this project is to create a prototype automated survey system that efficiently gathers patient information and allows easy updating of existing data in the course of usual care related to breast cancer screening. Group Health Cooperative of Washington (GHC) has a long history of using survey data to both assist with clinical care and facilitate reminders to women due for mammograms. GHC is currently redesigning its data system infrastructure to create an automated clinical information system using Epic software.  However, such software does not address population-based care that summarizes information for groups of people. Epic software does not allow activities such as outreach to those who may benefit from screening or chronic care management.  In order to create the potential for outreach and build on its experience with organized screening, GHC is building a cancer management system that will create a tool for managing screening in populations including surveys and care reminders. This system relies, in large part, on survey data collected to determine risk of breast cancer and appropriate screening interval.  Currently, paper surveys are used for this purpose and are administered. For the benefit of the NCI-affiliated National Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) sites, including the Group Health Cooperative and its patients, there is a further need to develop a rapid data collection system that provides updated data for those survey questions that change over time, and gathers that information efficiently in the course of usual care.  Such a system must also accommodate the needs for a high level of data security that insures protection for individuals, be compliant with HIPPA, be structured to add additional questions, and be compatible with other automated data systems to which the information might be exported. The specific aims of this pilot study are: 1)  To evaluate the hardware & software options for a HIPPA-compliant data collection system that would allow individuals to validate currently collected information, and update those items that could change; 2) To create a prototype proof of concept application that demonstrates the feasibility of automated survey collection in the course of mammography screening; 3) To provide a final survey software and system description to the NCI in a form that can be tested by Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium sites, including complete system specification.  The scope of this project is limited to finding solutions specifically for breast cancer care. However, to be generally useful, the solution must allow application to other data collection efforts that depend on survey data. The primary outcome of this study consists of the development of a software application that allows collection of breast cancer risk and medical data. The application will be available in a form for testing throughout the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Requirements:  During the project, the Contractor shall evaluate the viability of portable tablets, keyboards, and stationary personal computers as data collection platforms in radiology facilities. Issues to be investigated include concern about patient flow through the facility and loss of hardware, security of individual data, importation of previous survey responses, and export of individual data in a standard format for storage and use by other applications.  Once a hardware solution is identified, the software programming of the breast cancer screening survey questions will be undertaken.   A key issue in the software development shall be to ensure the capability to import prior responses to unchanging information, such as age at menarche or age at menopause, that is routinely asked within the National Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium but that could be directly updated from previously completed surveys.  For example, when prior responses exist for a question, the software should have the capability to validate the data against the prior record and prompt the respondent to resolve any conflicts that arise.  In a later phase of this effort, NCI anticipates that testing of the survey application will be conducted to evaluate whether the new method adversely effects data collection within mammography facilities and the breast cancer surveillance system.  The utility of the system for updating unchanging data in an efficient manner will be tested. The program shall allow presentation of questions from the Surveillance consortium standard survey (long form) and the Breast Cancer Screening program questions.  The contractor shall present a plan that details the following: 1) Description of the hardware options and compatibility with GHC system and other BCSC systems. 2) Description of system design and generalized interface for export and import of survey data, includes prototype specifications, a summary of interface implications for other Breast Cancer Screening Consortium facilities around the US, and summary of scope of prototype to be completed in the remaining project; 3) Approach to developing a prototype to a form that can be tested in clinical practice settings; 4) Approach to testing survey software and system use by evaluation in mammography center to provide system prototype to serve as a proof of concept; 5) Plans for deciding on design options and enhancements that would allow exports to either printers or monitors and the options for adding supporting material that women could query for educational purposes.  The time line shall detail each phase of the study, including hiring of personnel, developing a plan for the review of available systems and the development of software summary report writing, and delivery of final survey software and system description.  It is expected that the primary contractor shall collaborate with programmers and software development personnel outside, in order to meet the goals of this effort. The contractor is to provide adequate and appropriate staff, equipment, supplies, and space facilities necessary for carrying out the requirements of this procurement.  The hardware description and design issues relevant to easy collection and exporting of the data shall be done with appropriate consultation with other Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium programming experts and national experts on survey research.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on August 10, 2002.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemilogy Branch (REB) plans to enter into a sole source contract with Dr. Catherine Metayer, Calistoga, CA 94515.  This procurement will provide expert epidemiological and statistical analyses of data on a REB case-control study entitled ?Second Cancers Following Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) Study.  The Radiation Epidemiology Branch is collaborating with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) and the Medical College of Wisconsin, the statistical center for the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR-over 300 transplant centers world wide) to evaluate the risk of new malignancy among 26,000 BMT recipients.  This study has focused primarily on the risk of solid tumors developing among long-term survivors, and post-transplanted lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) developing early in the follow-up period.  Previous analyses done with the assistance of Dr. Metayer (263-MQ-115854) have opened up new areas for statistical exploration and additional analyses is needed.  The goals of the study are to quantify the risk of secondary solid cancer, overall and by individual anatomic site, and for post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders according to: 1) pre-transplant conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy;  2) preparative regimens for transplant, such as total body irradiation and intensive radiation, and 3) duration and drug type of immunosuppressive therapy for post-transplant graft-verus-host disease (GVHD) and post transplant disease-specific therapy.  Using datasets supplied by NCI, the Dr. Metayer will assist NCI in performing data analysis, epidemiologic evaluation, and data editing of the completed case-control studies into new areas identified by the previous analyses.  The vendor will further explore 2nd cancer risks associated with specific drug treatments  to evaluate potential statistical interactions with age, geographic region and other potential confounders.  Data editing will be required to prepare the drug data for analysis.   Conditional logistic regression analyses for matched case-control studies will be used, and statistical methods to identify interactions in these data will be employed.  In addition, for this study extension, unconditional logistic regression will be needed.  As before, all analyses will be performed for solid tumors, overall and at each anatomical site, and for PTLDs.  Dr. Catherine Metayer, a physician and a PhD trained medical epidemiologist, is uniquely qualified to conduct the epidemiologic and statistical analyses in the REB studies on bone marrow transplantation.  She is the only scientist collaborating on the Second Cancers Following Allogeneic BMT Study (Allo BMT) with the required training in medicine, epidemiology of treatment-induced neoplasms, and expertise in statistical methodology for matched case-control designs.  Dr. Catherine Metayer?s experience is unique in that she participated in the design and implementation of the Allo BMT study and has conducted the initial phase of the data analyses. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement,  it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI research to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on August 12,  2002.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) PERTAINING TO PROPOSED NASA NUCLEAR SYSTEMS INITIATIVE
<SOLNBR>10-00039
<RESPDATE>090602
<ARCHDATE>07262003
<CONTACT>Ray  Taylor, Program Executive, Phone (202) 358-0766, Fax (202) 358-2697, Email rtaylor@hq.nasa.gov
<DESC>PURPOSE The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites you to submit a response to RFI 10-00039 to assist in the planning for research and development under the proposed NASA Nuclear Systems Initiative.  BACKGROUND The President's Fiscal Year 2003 budget request to the Congress proposes a new initiative, the NASA Nuclear Systems Initiative, to enable significantly enhanced science-driven solar system exploration. The proposed NASA Nuclear Systems Initiative contains two elements: ·	Radioisotope Power Systems Development ·	Nuclear Fission Electrical Power and Propulsion Research and Development This Request for Information pertains only to Nuclear Fission Electrical Power and Propulsion Research and Development. Nuclear Fission Electrical Power and Propulsion Research and Development This element of the proposed NASA Nuclear Systems Initiative researches technologies and systems for high-power electrical power generation and propulsion. Such power sources generate heat from nuclear fission, and convert this heat into electrical power (~10's kW electric).  Solar system exploration spacecraft could utilize this electrical power for high power electric propulsion, operate significantly more capable passive and active remote sensing scientific instrumentation, and operate spacecraft engineering subsystems including significantly higher bandwidth communications for science data return to Earth.    Depending upon the characteristics of a specific science mission, this electric propulsion could potentially reduce launch window constraints for gravity assists, potentially reduce trip time, potentially increase payload mass, and potentially support entry into orbit of planets and their moons.  The only nuclear fission electrical power system launched by the U.S. was the SNAP-10A in 1965.  An example systems diagram of nuclear fission electrical power and propulsion systems is provided for reference in Appendix A. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NASA seeks information to support planning for technology research in support of the proposed NASA Nuclear Systems Initiative in the area of nuclear fission electrical power and propulsion.  NASA seeks information on technologies and system approaches in the following technology areas. · Space-based nuclear fission reactors and related components including fuel, cladding, core cooling components (e.g., pumps, heat pipes, working fluids), instrumentation and control for extended remote and autonomous operation (reflectors, control rods, drive mechanisms, sensors, radiation-hardened electronics, etc.), high-temperature and unique materials, and other equipment unique to the reactor system (e.g., gas separators); ·	Lightweight and high temperature shielding for neutron and gamma radiation attenuation; · Lightweight, efficient heat exchangers for the transfer of thermal energy from the nuclear fission reactor to the power conversion system and to the radiators; ·	Power conversion, including long-lived (e.g., 10 years or more) static and dynamic systems; ·	Power management, control, distribution, and electro-magnetic interference mitigation (including suppression of arcing, corona, radiation hardening of parts); ·	Lightweight, deployable space-based thermal radiators, for the rejection of waste heat from a power conversion system; ·	High-power electric propulsion, ·	Technologies, technical approaches, and concepts for rapid development fission reactor power systems with the following range of electrical power levels:  3-10 kWe (planetary surface with atmosphere), 100-250 kWe (space-based, for spacecraft/payload power and electric propulsion). ·	Technologies, technical approaches, and concepts for space-based fission reactor power systems with the following electrical power capabilities:, 1 MWe, 3 MWe, 10 MWe, 30 MWe, for more advance planetary exploration.  For each of these technology areas or combinations of the above, information is sought in the following categories: ·	Safety (analyses completed and corresponding results; safety testing completed and corresponding results); ·	Requirements (performance requirements to which the technology, component, or system was designed and tested); ·	Performance characteristics (operating temperatures, transient response, physical properties, etc.); ·	State of the art (the degree of research, development, and testing completed; such as concept level, system requirements review level, system concept level, preliminary design, detailed design, component fabrication and lifetime testing results, qualification model, space flight model); ·	Degradation and failure mechanisms (e.g., graceful degradation or other); ·	Scalability (approach for, and degree to which the concept supports, scaling to higher and/or lower thermal and/or electrical power levels); ·	Ancillary / derived system requirements (angular momentum management, control systems and redundancy to support autonomous recovery from failures); ·	Innovative and cost effective approaches to development and demonstration; ·	Manufacturability (availability, and/or timeline to reestablish availability, of materials, including specialized nuclear-related materials, to support research and development); · Testability at ambient conditions or in relevant environments, including hard vacuum, and unique testing facilities; ·	Schedule (range of schedule estimates for research, development, testing, life testing and qualification). In consideration of information provide in response to the above, information is also requested regarding overall system design, development, integration, test, and flight qualification: o  What would be candidate technical approaches (and estimated timelines) for the development and flight qualification of an initial fission power and electric propulsion system, based on existing and/or near-term technologies, and of potentially reduced power level.  Based on these technical approaches and timelines, what would be needed in order to conduct this development, including materials manufacturing, component manufacturing, and systems engineering, integration, and test. RESPONSE PREPARATION Guidelines for the preparation and transmittal of responses to this RFI are contained in Appendix B. Responses to this RFI are due September 6, 2002, by 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time.  Respondents will be provided the opportunity to make a presentation (no longer than 1 hour in duration) regarding their submitted responses at NASA Headquarters.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Digilab, of Cambridge, MA, for acquisition of one (1) Infrared Microimaging Platform System, to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, at NIST to perform infrared imaging.  Award will be made under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.*****Installation and training at the NIST laboratory shall be included.  In addition, a one-year on-site warranty on parts and labor, shall be included.*****Sole source determination is based on the Division's need to be able to perform infrared imaging on a system meeting the following specifications, which Digilab is uniquely qualified to do: High intensity water-cooled ceramic IR source (range 9,600-50 cm-1), a high spectral throughput air bearing 60? Michelson interferometer with 0.10 cm-1 resolution (0.075 cm-1 unapodized) at 2000 cm-1 , and dynamic alignment of tilt compensation, as well as dynamic velocity correction, which are both essential to recording an accurate and reproducible interferogram.  In addition, the Digilab system is the only system that during step-scan operation the spectrometer is able to sample up to five channels during each step for multiple channel spectroscopy.  For example, this system allows for the simultaneous measurements of static, 0o phase and 90o phase spectra during modulation experiments. No other system can perform this operation, necessary to the operation of infrared imaging.  The Digilab system is also the only system with a theoretical free-scanning range, which can cover the range 0-63,200 cm-1 without the need for "folding" or other numerical techniques, which would restrict the scanning range and potential use at shorter wavelengths.  Finally, the DigiLab focal plane array detector is capable of multiple thermal cycles without de-lamination of the MCT detector material from the silicon read-out electronics.  This technology prevents a very costly ($50,000.00 repair cost) failure mechanism from occurring and is a DigiLab patented feature.*****Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within ninety (90) days or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 12, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

Presently, all of the units have a Limited Operating Period (LOP) for owls and most of the units for the marbled murrelet (MAMU).  The contractor shall ensure that an adequate workforce is available to complete the contract within the specified time period.  Contract time: 61 calendar days.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency.  Numbered note 1 applies.

<DESC>Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking University and Industry partners for the efforts synopsized. Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) released a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) on July 16, 2002 for the Instrument Incubator Program (IIP).  The Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) fosters the development of innovative remote-sensing concepts and the assessment of these concepts in ground, aircraft, or engineering model demonstrations.  This NRA solicits analytical studies, lab demonstrations, field demonstrations, instrument requirements analysis, instrument design, and engineering model construction for innovative measurement techniques which have the highest potential to meet goals of the IIP and the measurement capability requirements of the Office of Earth Science.  Successful proposers must present concepts which have great potential for enabling new science measurements and/or reducing instrument cost, size, mass, and resource use.  The IIP will competitively select through a peer review process proposals to participate in the program.  The total proposed period of performance should not exceed 36 months. NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the IIP to develop proposals and execute development and performance demonstrations of Earth science instrumentation and instrument subsystems.  It is expected that selection of the proposal(s) and availability of funds would result in instrument and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s).  This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited.  It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide subsystems and instruments consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), (ii) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (iii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned and unmanned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and the AN/FPS/124 unattended short range radars, as well as the site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 18 remote Alaska locations on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior (access by air, seasonal access by barge).  The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, many miles of gravel roads, tram systems at several sites, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection.  Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation.  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the summer of 2003, with award in the January-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 8 October 2002.

<DESC>The Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) Joint Program Office  intends to issue a production contract to procure the next generation Anti-Jam Antenna System.  The system will consist of a small antenna with four to seven elements referred to as a Small Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (SCRPA) and an electronics control unit referred to as a Digital Antenna Electronics (DAE).  
It is anticipated that an RFP will be released in 2Q FY03.  Source selection will be based on written proposals for the DAE and SCRPA and a test sample for the DAE.  The DAE test sample will be evaluated by the government beginning in 4Q FY03.  Contract award is projected for 2Q FY04 with deliveries 12 months after receipt of order. It is anticipated that six DAE and four SCRPA First Articles will be procured initially; subsequently, there will be four one-year production options planned which will bring the total number of systems to approximately 869 DAEs and 624 SCRPAs. The DAE shall incorporate advanced digital signal processing techniques to provide enhanced interference suppression in the Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 and L2 frequency bands.  The DAE shall be capable of modifying the quiescent antenna pattern of the CRPA or SCRPA to create nulls or null regions in the direction of spatially distributed interference sources within the GPS frequency bands.  It shall be capable of autonomously steering a single antenna beam with increased gain in a direction normal to the plane of the CRPA/SCRPA in the hemisphere above the CRPA/SCRPA under static conditions to aid in initial GPS receiver signal acquisition.  The DAE shall be compatible with the proposed GPS Modernization M-Code signal. The DAE shall be a drop-in replacement for the current GAS-1 AE with existing electrical and mechanical interfaces to CRPAs, GPS receivers, and Host Vehicles.    It shall be capable of operating with the seven element CRPA LRU as specified in CI-GAS-1/CRPA-300B as well as the four to seven element SCRPA being produced under this program.   It is desirable that it operates with other existing seven element CRPAs within the military inventory. The SCRPA shall be a seven-element antenna with a footprint of seven inches square and one and a half inches high (or less).  A potential variant is a four element SCRPA with a footprint of 4.68 inches square and 1.25 inches high, which is the size of the Fixed Reception Pattern antenna (FRPA). Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement Of Capability (SOC).  The SOC shall not exceed ten pages.  Information submitted should be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration on each of the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed and any in-house research and development effort, (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientist, engineers, and technical personnel who may be assigned as a principal investigator and/or project officer, (3) Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, (4) A statement regarding industry security clearance, and (5) Any other specific information that would enhance our evaluation.
The SOC is due 26 August 2002. The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition. 
The Government does not intend to award any contract as a result of, or pay any costs associated with, submittal of information solicited herein.  The SOC and all related communications that contain proprietary information should be marked as such.  An Ombudsman, Mr William Orzech, at (310) 363-0588, has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<ARCHDATE>07262003
<CONTACT>RAY LEWIS CONTRACTING OFFICER  RLEWIS@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is requesting proposals for Research and Studies sponsored by the Weather Damage Modification Program (WDMP) from state offerors or state government/research entity offerors.  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships with states located within Hawaii and the 17 western states served by Reclamation, to address the potential for the mitigation of weather damage through weather modification techniques.  The goal of the program is to improve and evaluate physical mechanisms to limit damage due to weather phenomena such as drought and hail, and enhance water supplies through a regional weather modification research program, and to transfer validated technologies for implementation on operational programs. Weather-related natural disasters in the United States annually result in the losses of billions of dollars.  Drought, hail, floods, and tornadoes are among the most common causes.  The WDMP is consistent with national objectives to strengthen disaster mitigation capabilities of industry, and local, state, and federal governments, and with Reclamation's role as a water resource management agency. Efforts to directly mitigate weather-related losses through atmospheric water management technology (cloud seeding), are presently being conducted in many states.  However, local sponsors of these programs fund only the projects themselves, and provide few resources to scientifically evaluate questions on their efficacy, scientific basis, safety, and extra-area effects.  While state agencies are charged with the project regulation, and many also provide significant cost-sharing, little is being done to answer the questions that will ultimately determine how these technologies are improved and refined.  The WDMP is designed to produce those new technologies by funding scientific, peer-reviewed, research proposals submitted by state entities or state government/research entites having operational programs.  For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation is soliciting proposals in three (3) different research and study areas for projects of 12 months duration or less (follow-on funding may be available for additional research studies or future demonstration projects).  The areas of study are: Task A - Snowpack Augmentation for Drought Mitigation Studies; Task B - Rain Augmentation for Drought Mitigation Studies; Task C - Thunderstorm Hail Mitigation Studies.  State offerors or state government/research entity offerors must be willing to cost-share 50% or more of the project costs, as well as identify an existing operational program (or programs) that will allow the proposed research to be "piggy-backed" onto existing operational cloud seeding activities and/or related research projects.  No profit or fee will be allowed.  Patent rights for any developments will be retained by the research partner (state offerors or state government/research entitiy offerors) in accordance with provisions contained in the solicitation. The WDMP is authorized in fiscal year 2002 Conference Report 107-258 Title II ... Bureau of Reclamation - Water and Related Resources: "The conference agreement includes $2,582,000 for the Drought Emergency Assistance Program.  Within that amount, $2,000,000 is for the Bureau of Reclamation to establish a Weather Damage Modification Program, including a regional weather modification research program..."  Also, Section 206(b) of the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-250) specifically authorizes Reclamation to fund the WDMP.  The specific provision follows:The Secretary is authorized to conduct a Precipitation Management Technology Transfer Program to help alleviate problems caused by precipitation variability and droughts in the West, as part of a balanced long-term water resources development and management program.  In consultation with State, Tribal, and local water, hydropower, water quality and instream flow interests, areas shall be selected for conducting cost-shared field studies on a 50-50 basis to validate and quantify the potential for appropriate precipitation management technology to augment streamflows.  Validated technologies shall be transferred to non-Federal interests for operational implementation.  Offerors interested in this project may request a copy of the solicitation package by providing a written request by facsimile to (303) 445-6345, or a request by regular mail to the address provided herein.  TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.  The solicitation package is scheduled for issuance on or about August 16, 2002 with proposals due on approximately October 16,2002.  It is anticipated that awards will be made in the late fall of 2002, with an anticipated project start date of no later than December 20, 2002.

<DESC>The Administration on Aging (AOA) through the Division of Acquisition Management, Program Support Center (PSC), HHS, intends to modify Contract Number 231-98-0010 currently being performed by the University of Kansas.  This modification will extend current contract statutory required  evaluation activities for the Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to States Program (ADDGS) that encompass the collection of data, analysis and evaluation of the 33 main ADDGS projects.   The evaluation entails the collection, management, and analysis of client demographic and service utilization data, as well as a process evaluation focused on systems development and successful implementation strategies.  The University of Kansas shall utilize the existing approved OMB approved data collection protocols and data collection instruments in the 33 Alzheimer's Demonstration grantee states.   The proposed modification for which the Government intends to solicit only one source is under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the services required will be reviewed.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.

If no affirmative responses are received within 45 days from the date of this synopsis, the Contracting Office will proceed with award of the modification to the University of Kansas.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Spectrophotometer-based automated Analyzer
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to enter into a single source contract with MLS Scientific, Lockport, Illinois.  This contract is to procure a Bran & Luebbe Auto Analyzer 3 System-XYZ Sampler and Data Handler, replacing a Government-owned Bran & Luebbe analyzer currently being used.  This analyzer has the capability of measuring blood chemistries that were measured on the old system, including direct measurement of para-amino hippuric acid, glucose, ammonia, urea, and alpha-amino nitrogen in whole-blood.  In addition, the ability to analyze for albumen concentration in plasma is required.  The capability to use the analyzer to measure nitrate, nitrite, total phosphorus, and ammonia using EPA-approved methods is necessary.  The analyzer shall have the capability of accepting automatically  sampling of a minimum of 200 samples at a time.  The capability of calculating concentrations of a given substance in a sample and creating an electronic data file that contains sample identification and the concentration of substrates of interest is required.  The key element is the ability to analyze whole blood without additional  sample preparation.  Sample preparation for use in the other clinical analyzers adds questionable unknowns and assumptions for our specific use.  In addition to meeting the analytical needs, purchase of an AutoAnalyzer 3 would allow use of chemical manifolds from the system being replaced which cost an estimated $4000-$5000 each.
