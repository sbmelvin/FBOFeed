<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for development of a stabilized single longitudinal mode laser seeder. The goal of this effort is to develope a compact, rugged, electrically efficient, tunable diode laser source suitable for seeding Nd: YAD lasers at 1064 nm.  The seed laser source will consist of a custom developed semiconductor laser coupled to an electro-optically tunable Bragg grating embedded within a waveguide in a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) crystal.  The size, reliability, and durability of this laser will make it ideal for injection locking airborne and space-based high power Nd:YAG lasers.  The folloowing work is scheduled for completion by September 30, 2002:  1) all necessary components will be ordered with exact specifications to achieve flight worthiness in their final assembly; 2)  Bragg waveguides will be embedded in KTP substrates that will narrow and stabilize the output of the semiconductor laser.  Parameters will be varied during this process that will produce Bragg waveguides optimized for this specific application; 3) Output from the semiconductor laser will be coupled into the KTP Bragg waveguides aligned in a bench top prototype.  The output will be characterized for wavelength, power, linewidth, and thermal tuning. Deliverables are four progress reports to be submitted July 1, August 1, September 1 and October 1.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items from  AdvR, Inc. 910 Technology Blvd., Bozeman, MT. AdvR has a process which writes a Bragg grating in a KTP microchip substrate.  This grating is then tuned with a low voltage to reflect a desired wavelength.  AdvR is the only company that can delivery such as item.  Currently, there is not laser company that produces an external cavity tuned diode source that can meet the required wavelength and packaging requirements.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<CONTACT>John Thompson, (703)697-3412
<DESC>NA Broad Agency Announcement Number BAA-DODPI-02-001.  The Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W), on behalf of the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute (DoDPI), is requesting proposals for thesis, dissertation, and institutional research grant a wards under the DoDPI Personnel Security Thesis, Dissertation and Institutional Research Awards Program.  DoDPI is seeking to locate multiple sites around the country to support this initiative. In addition to providing funding to investigators, DoDPI is l ooking to offer temporary post-doctoral positions, visiting faculty positions, and sabbatical assignments to bolster our production.  Moreover, DoDPI is looking to take advantage of the highest quality University labs and industrial technology that may hav e ideas on our subjects of interest.  Collaboration is not new to DoDPI; it has been awarding extramural research awards since 1987.  This increased effort to collaborate is an adjustment in the strategic plan for increasing the amount of research that is acceptable to the academic and scientific communities.  The DoDPI research mission is to:  (a) evaluate the validity of psychophysiological detection of deception (PDD) techniques used by the Department of Defense (DoD); (b) investigate countermeasures and  anti-countermeasures; and (c) conduct developmental research on PDD techniques, instrumentation, and analytic methods.  While DoDPI will evaluate all research proposals within our mission objectives, those that address the topics identified herein will re ceive priority.  Proposals to use procedures similar to those currently in use by Federal agencies that conduct PDD examinations will receive priority over proposals which use other, less applicable, procedures.  While DoDPI is interested in, and will supp ort, basic research, the majority of our funding will be awarded to proposals describing applied research that is of immediate use to the PDD community.  PROGRAM SCOPE AND FUNDING.  DoDPI intends to evaluate applications for the award of multiple Federal A ssistance instruments (grants) under this BAA.  The maximum award amount for a master’s degree thesis is $5,000 per project.  The maximum award for a dissertation thesis is $15,000 per project.  The maximum amount for institutional awards is $300,000 per p roject.  Institutions are eligible to receive simultaneous awards for different projects. Awards are for a one-year period.  DoDPI will support multi-year projects by funding the first year and making decisions on subsequent year funding dependent on the ( a) DoDPI evaluation of current year deliverables (usually a report) and (b) availability of funds.  GENERAL INFORMATION.  The BAA provides detailed specifications, proposal requirements, notices to applicants and general terms and conditions for grant awar ds in support of DoD research projects will be available immediately at the DoDPI website at http://www.dodpoly.army.mil/research/baa2002.htm.  Proposals should be submitted to the Department of Defense Polygraph Institute.  Telephone, mail, and electronic  mail inquiries about projects are welcome.  The BAA will only be made available in electronic format.  This program is not yet listed in the Catalog for Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA).  Executive Order (E.O.) 12372 is not applicable; applications are not subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SSPOC).  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS.  (1) Special Projects, (2) New Technology, (3) Applied Topics, (4) PDD Data Analyses, and (5) Deterrence.  EVALUATION CRITERIA.  The selection criteria that will be  used to evaluate the proposals will be:  (1) Practical applicability of results.  Are the topic and the study design such that the results of the research may have direct implications in the development and implementation of policy in the area of personne l security?  (2) The perceived need for the subject matter in the personnel security body of knowledge. Will the study help to resolve questions that would be o f use for improving the field of personnel security?  (3) Originality of the research. The originality may apply to the topic itself, or to the treatment of a topic that has already been the subject of considerable research.  (4) Quality and feasibility of  the research methods.  Is the methodology suited to the kind of study proposed?  Does the plan indicate that the appropriate information will be collected?  Is there evidence that the capacity exists for properly analyzing the data that will be collected?   (5) Strength of the evidence that the applicant(s) possess the necessary qualifications to produce an acceptable research product.  Is the proposal clearly written?  Does it include essential details that enable the reviewer to conceptualize the project in its entirety?  Does the proposal indicate that the researcher(s) has/have knowledge of the significant literature?  Does the proposal contain the essential elements of a well-developed research plan?  Does the investigator(s) background information refl ect a track record of research accomplishment or potential?  (6) Realism and reasonableness of the estimated expenses. Have all of the likely expenses been included?  Are the project expenses both realistic and reasonable?  To what extent is the institutio n providing support through cost-sharing measures?  (7) The program under which the proposal was submitted. Was the proposal submitted under the thesis, dissertation or the institutional award program?  SUBMISSION DEADLINES.  Proposals submitted prior by t he deadline of 1 June 2002 will be considered during FY2002. Proposals submitted after 1 June 2002, but before the deadline of 1 June 2003 will be considered during FY 2003.

<DESC>PURPOSE:
The Office Of  Public Health and Science (OPHS), Office Of Minority Health (OMH), through the Program Support Center, plans to award a 14 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures, to Massachusetts General Hospital, 50 Staniford Street, Boston, MA. 02114.  The anticipated date of award is May 6, 2002.

The purpose of this contract is to conduct a study, as part of an urgently needed effort to build the science, related to the impact of providing-and not providing-language assistance services to limited-English proficient (LEP) populations in the context of health care delivery.  Utilizing data from (an) ongoing or recently completed study/studies examining the impact of providing-not providing--interpreter services for LEP patients on medical errors/patient safety and other aspects of quality of health care, this study will examine the costs and benefits of providing such services, including the direct costs of interpreter services/savings from providing/not providing such services, and the costs and benefits resulting from medical errors and enhanced patient safety and/or other aspects of health care quality.  The project will include an examination of data from actual clinical encounters between physicians-patients, design/development of a tool or instrument that can readily identify the nature and extent of medical errors due to language barriers (for LEP populations), initial creation of a model to estimate the impact of these errors on cost and quality of care, and comparisons of error frequency, cost and benefits, impacts, and outcomes between varying levels of interpreter services (no interpreters, untrained interpreters, and medically trained interpreters).

The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.

For further information, please contact Nora Tyson in Rm. 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD. 20857 or on 301-443-8826.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement to develop an effective hydrodynamic design evaluation tool for LPD well dock vessels.  The Coast Guard?s interest in this project is related to the hydrodynamics of stern-ramp boat deployment.  The first phase of this project succeeded in coupling together the time-domain sea-keeping program and a CFD program.  This is the first time that these two types of analysis tools have been brought together in a functional form although further development needs to be done.  The combination allows local hydrodynamic phenomena to be investigated within the environment of whole-ship sea-keeping motions.  In terms of stern-ramp boat deployment, the coupled analysis tool will have the capability to model propeller wash as a current superimposed on ship motion to generate turbulent flow astern while operating in a seaway.  In addition, the investigation into wave reflection characteristics within the well dock against vertical and sloping surfaces of different porosity will contribute to design and proper selection of stern ramp slope and grating porosity for the most effective wave and entrained water dissipation as a RHIB lands upon the stern ramp. It is anticipated that a non-competitive sole source purchase order will be issued for this study to: Oceanic Consulting Corporation, St. John?s, Newfoundland unless additional sources are located. All responsible and responsive sources are invited to express their interest and ABILITY to provide the above-described service via fax or e-mail to Mr. Orofino, no later than April 30, 2002. All responsive and responsible sources may submit a quote, which will be considered by this agency. ATTENTION: Minority, Women-Owned and Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)!  The Department of Transportation (DOT), short-term Lending Program (STLP) offers working capital financing in the form of lines of credit to finance accounts receivable for transportation related contracts. Maximum line of credit is $500,000 with interest at the prime rate. For further information, call (800) 532-1169. Internet address: http://osdbuweb.dot.gov. See Note 22 & 26.

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Retro Rocket as the only known source who can meet agency requirements. The models will be used for public outreach. Retro Rocket has already produced X-43 models, they currently have the full numerical geometries for each of these configurations, and already have molds for immediate use. They have mastered both the smaller scale producation of this genre of flight vehicles, as well as larger scale models of the same. As such, Retro Rocket is in a unique position to fabricate additional models in a rapid manner, of high quality, and at a low cost to meet Programmatic requirements. Award to other than Retro Rocket would result in a significant learning curve, significant duplicated costs, repeated activities regarding geometries and molds, and schedule delays. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 26, 2002.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established objectives to increase the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their babies in the early postpartum period and at six months postpartum by the year 2010. Under a Government Performance Reporting Act mandate to provide programs and services toward the achievement of this objective, the Office of Women's Health has released the first comprehensive national policy to promote optimal breastfeeding practices which recommends that DHHS launch and evaluate a public health marketing campaign, to include a media campaign, to portray breastfeeding as normal, desirable, and achievable. Through this marketing effort, the DHHS-OWH's goal is to broaden the awareness of breastfeeding to the general public by launching a National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign to increase subsequent rates of exclusive breastfeeding in first time mothers. The Department of Interior's GovWorks Federal Acquisition Center, under authority of the Department's Franchise Fund and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Women's Health, intends to award a Time and Materials type contract under Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Negotiations will be undertaken with the Advertising Council, Inc., a not-for-profit nationally recognized and endorsed organization, based on their unique expertise, time-perfected techniques, and access to and support from major associations in the advertising and communications industry which allow the "Ad Council" to provide volunteer efforts and donated media time and space resulting in an excess of a 4000% return on the Government's investment. Other parties having an interest in this project may identify their qualifications and capabilities no later than 8 May 2002. Demonstrated qualifications and capabilities must illustrate proven experience with implementing and promoting a national and selected regional/local level public service advertising campaign, focusing on two primary target audiences and other secondary audiences, and employing state-of-the-art communication techniques as well as a variety of communications channels and program strategies, including but not limited to print, radio, television public service announcements, media kits, and non-traditional marketing channels. Additional qualifications and capabilities should address community media outreach and public relations as they relate to public service advertising at this level and associated post-campaign monitoring and analysis, as well as access to and support from major advertising and communications industry associations. This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is there a solicitation associated with this announcement. However, any interest shown will be reviewed by the Government and used only for the purposes of determining whether a competitive procurement is in the best interests of the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may provide qualifications and capabilities documentation to GovWorks, Attn: Jeanie Kampschroeder, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170-4817, Phone 703-787-1352 or Fax 703-787-1009.

The building is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting of this work.  The A/E firm as used in this RFQ is an association, joint venture partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  
The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility to conceive the design concept and the building's architecture.

The A/E Teams must demonstrate that at least 35% of the A/E contract services will be accomplished within Texas.  
The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2" x 11" format.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the CBD announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; and modified Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project).  Identification of consultants is not required at this stage.  Submission requirements and evaluation criteria: 
(1) Past Performance on Design (35%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client's program, function, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.

Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria (1), the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of private-sector peers, and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  
(2) For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  The Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, 
design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings in the final A/E Team selection by the GSA.

Default. Bidders are cautioned to bid only on items they are prepared to pay for and remove in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of this sale. Failure to pay for and remove all items awarded within the specified time could result in termination of the contract. The bidder also may be subject to paying liquidated damages. The following supersedes Clause No. 9 of the SF 114C. 
If, after the award, the Purchaser breaches the contract by failure to make payment within the time allowed by the contract as required by Condition No. 6, or by failure to remove the property as required by Condition No. 8, the Purchaser shall lose all right, title, and interest which he or she might otherwise have acquired in and to such property as to which a default has occurred. The Purchaser agrees that in the event he/she fails to pay for the property in the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20 percent of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default has occurred, or (b) $200 whichever is greater, or in the event he or she fails to remove the same within the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain as liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20 percent of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default has occurred, or (b) $200, or full purchase price of such item(s) less than $200: Provided, That in the event of multiple awards of items under a single Invitation for Bids, the amount to be charged, if the minimum charge provided for in (b) above is applicable, shall be determined by the total purchase price reflected in the award documents: Provided further, That the maximum sum which may be recovered by the Government as damages for failure of the Purchaser to pay for and remove the property shall be the formula amount. The Government shall specifically apprise the Purchaser, either in its notice of default (or in separate subsequent written notice), that upon the expiration of the period prescribed for curing the default, the formula amount will be retained (or collected) by the Government as liquidated damages. However, if the property was sold on a "per lot" basis and the Purchaser removes a portion of the lot but fails to remove the balance, no portion of the purchase price will be refunded. If the Purchaser otherwise fails in the performance of his or her obligations, the Government may exercise such rights and may pursue such remedies as are provided by law or under the contract. 
Blocked from Bidding. In the event bidders default for non-payment, they will lose all rights to place bids for other items. They will only be allowed to "browse" the items. At such time the bidder cures his or her default, they will be unlocked and be given access to begin bidding on items. 
State Sales and or Use Tax. Purchasers of Federal personal property may be subject to payment of a State sales and or use tax. The U.S. Government is not responsible for collection of State taxes. Purchasers may obtain information from a State tax office. Sales and or use tax officials are permitted to examine records of Federal personal property sales to determine tax liability. 
Sales to Government Employees. DOJ employees or spouse or minor child of  DOJ employees, or their agents, may not bid on Federal personal property. An employee of another agency may bid if he or she is not prohibited from doing so by his or her employing agency's rules or regulations. 
Modification of Bids. The following replaces Clause No. 3.(b) of the SF 114C. Bids received for items offered in the FreeMarkets website may be raised before the closing date and time, as specified in the offering. Bids cannot be lowered or canceled. 
Terminated Auctions. It may be necessary to withdraw items from bidding due to technical errors or uncontrollable circumstances. Auctions may be terminated because the property is no longer available due to federal agency or state needs; property becomes damaged; property is stolen, or property was improperly described. In most cases, these items will be reoffered at a later date. 
Requirements to Comply with Applicable Laws & Regulations. It is the purchaser's responsibility to ascertain and comply with all applicable Federal, State, local, multi-jurisdictional and export laws, ordinances, and regulations pertaining to the registration, licensing, handling, possession, transportation, transfer, export, processing, manufacture, sale, use or disposal of the property listed in the Invitation.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) seeks proposals for the development of technologies that provide enhanced capabilities and functionality for future Command & Control (C2) and Combat Systems, in support of FORCEnet and network centric operations.  There are six main areas of interest: (1) information management; (2) image processing and exploitation; (3) visualization technology; (4) battle space decision aids; (5) networked C2 for combat application; and (6) information network situational awareness.  

Selected projects will be funded under the C2 and Combat Systems Discovery and Invention Program, with an anticipated start in October 2002.  The Program will focus on technologies in the six aforementioned thrust areas that can support the requirements of FORCEnet and network centric warfare.  The goals of the program are to develop a capability for performing integrated decision-making and mission execution to achieve battle-space superiority.  The technologies will provide a foundation for integrated decision-making and mission execution across command echelons through interconnected C2 and Combat Systems in a network centric operation.  

A full program description of this announcement is found below in Section II, entitled, Research Opportunity Description. A copy of this BAA is available at www.onr.navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

52.222-48 Exemption from Application of Service Contract Act Provisions for Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, and/or Repair of Certain Information Technology, Scientific and Medical, and/or Office and Business Equipment--Contractor Certification.

As prescribed in 22.1006(e)(1), insert the following clause: 
EXEMPTION FROM APPLICATION OF SERVICE CONTRACT ACT PROVISIONS 
FOR CONTRACTS FOR MAINTENANCE, CALIBRATION, AND/OR REPAIR 
OF CERTAIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL AND/OR OFFICE AND BUSINESS EQUIPMENT--CONTRACTOR CERTIFICATION (AUG 1996) 

(a) The following certification shall be checked: 
CERTIFICATION 
The offeror certifies [ ] does not certify [ ] that: 

(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are commercial items, which are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the Contractor in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; 

(2) The contract services are furnished at prices, which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, and/or repair of certain information technology, scientific and medical, and/or office and business equipment. An "established catalog price" is a price (including discount price) recorded in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other verifiable and established record that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the Contractor and is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers. An "established market price" is a current price, established in the course of ordinary and usual trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated by data from sources independent of the manufacturer or Contractor; and 

(3) The Contractor utilizes the same compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract as the Contractor uses for equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. 

(b) If a negative certification is made and a Service Contract Act wage determination is not attached to the solicitation, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible. 

(c) Failure to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (b) of this clause may render the bid or offer nonresponsive. 
(End of clause)

<DESC>The Library of Congress has a requirement for preservation/archival services to re-house pre-1900 American Maps into alkaline buffered folders for the Geography & Map Division of the Library of Congress.  Many of the Library's holding are housed in poor quality acidic folders, boxes, and sleeves.  Acids cause the containers to become brittle and they then migrate to and destroy items inside of the containers.  These acidic enclosures shall be replaced with acid-free enclosures that will be provided by the Library.  Requirements include retrieval of maps from flat files, removal of maps from acidic folders, condition assessment, transfer of descriptive information located on the outside of the original folder, and return of maps to flat files.  It is anticipated that approx. 75,000 maps shall be re-housed.  All work shall be performed on-site.  Personnel requirements include three professional archivists with a degree from an accredited master of science in Library and Information Science, or Archives Management, or related equivalent; proven experience in archives, demonstrated familiarity with archival best practices, and holdings maintenance/preservation activities.  Services to include a base year and two (2) option years.  Solicitation S-LC02021 will be posted on this site on or about May 9, 2002.

<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Ing. Vaclav Pritzl, General Manager, Druid a.s., Havlickova 5, 301 37 Plzen, Czech Republic, Tel.:011 420 188 422 535, Fax: 011 420 188 422 537, Email:pritzl@arcom.cz :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to select an appropriate biomass-to-energy technology for the pilot project and formulate a viable strategy to implement the company?s other biomass-to-energy projects.

Druid, a.s. is a large agricultural conglomerate, which was formed in 1996 as a joint-stock company for nine agricultural cooperatives with over 18,000 hectares of land.  In addition to agricultural products, Druid sells fuel and fertilizers. Druid wants to analyze the possibility of installing cogeneration units for heat and electricity, which would be fueled from waste biomass from Druid?s operations.  It intends to undertake a pilot project at Podhoran Cernikov, a subsidiary and its largest farm (primarily poultry), to supply heat and electricity for poultry farming and wood processing operations.  If this project is successful, Druid will replicate the biomass-to-energy technique at its other operations. 
The pilot plant will be designed mainly to supply heat and electricity for poultry farming at Podhoran Cernikov. The pilot plant should meet peak demands of 400-500 kilowatts of heat and 200-250 kilowatts of electricity.  The pilot plant could also supply some electricity to the local grid, which has been unreliable. Heat supply has also been unreliable as the local boiler is aged and there is limited access to gas at this location. Podhoran Cernikov generates adequate quantities of biomass (sawdust, wood chips and agricultural product residues) from its other operations to meet its energy needs. 

The goal of the feasibility study is to select an appropriate technology for the pilot biomass-to-energy plant for the production of combined heat and power including design specifications and to develop financing and implementation plans for the pilot plant and subsequent biomass-to-energy plants.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $123,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).  Druid a.s. will be responsible for contributing at least an additional $14,000 worth of in-kind and cash contributions towards the cost of the study.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirementsas of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, May 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Maj. Chris Harrington, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604. Please be prepared to identify previous contacts made by you in an attempt to resolve your concerns.
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with ADE Technologies, Inc., of Newton, MA, for acquisition of one (1) Magnetic Field Measurement System (VSM Model 10).  The System will be used by the Metallurgy Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, for the investigation of magnetic materials, including multilayer powders, thin films and bulk pieces.  In addition, the System will provide a means for applying the large magnetic fields at various angles needed for characterizing the magnetic state of these materials.*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the System to interface with the power supply and control software existing in the laboratory.  There is currently in the NIST laboratory a DMS Model 70140 Bipolar Power Supply system with DMS Model 32KP field control.  It is computer controlled with overshoot-free field setting capability, and can deliver 140 Amps at 76 Volts into a load of 80 mH, 0.5 ohms.  It also possesses a large field sweep rate up to 160 kA/s.  In order to fully utilize these capabilities (and maintain its very low noise level (less than 100 microamps and less than 0.2 millivolts) the magnet must be matched with the power and field control systems.  The proposed magnetic field system is matched with this power supply.  In addition, the proposed magnetic field system possesses a large region of field homogeneity and is capable of being easily rotated 360 degrees so that the large magnetic field may be delivered at virtually any angle.  The existing power supply is controlled through software written in the NIST laboratory in Quick Basic, and the proposed Magnetic Field System is also compatible with this software, as it must be.  Thus, ADE Technologies, Inc. is uniquely qualified to meet the Government's requirement.*****
Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 120 days or less after receipt of order (ARO).*****Installation and training in the laboratory shall be provided.  A one-year factory repair Warranty, including parts and labor, shall be included.*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334519, and the size standard is 500 Employees.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by May 7, 2002, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-0270024A
<RESPDATE>053002
<ARCHDATE>06142002
<CONTACT>Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Phone 703-875-4357, Fax 703-875-4009, Email ekunene@tda.gov
<DESC>Submission Proposal Place:  Mgr. Tom?? Dr?pela, General Manager, Plze?sk? tepl?rensk?, a.s, Doubravecka 1, 304 10 Plzen, Czech Republic, Tel:+420 19 7237735, 7180213, Fax:+420 19 7235845 :  

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant.

Plzenska Teplarenska, a.s. (PT), is the largest thermal energy generator and distributor in West Bohemia.  Its main activities have been the production and distribution of heat and power in Plzen, where it serves nearly 40,000 households and several government and commercial buildings in the city. The main combined heat and power (CHP) station of Plzenska Teplarenska is located at Doubravecka in Plzen, where total revenue in 1999 was about 1.2 billion CZK (nearly $35 million).  

The City of Plzen has authorized Plzenska Teplarenska, a.s. (PT), to develop a WTE project to burn municipal solid wastes (MSW) generated in the city and its neighboring communities and transform it to energy.   The landfill currently serving the Plzen region is almost full.  Also, due to recent Czech laws and European Union regulations that will make the use of landfills increasingly expensive in the next few years, WTE seems to be a more attractive option to solve waste and energy needs.  Private firms that are now collecting and segregating MSW in the Plzen region send only the wastes that cannot be profitably recycled or composted to landfills. PT estimates that up to 100,000 metric tons of MSW might be available per year for the WTE project. Based on this estimate, PT is considering installing one mass-burn incinerator and other systems with the possibility of installing a second incinerator according to the projected quantity of MSW available.  The incinerator(s) will be used to increase the production of heat and power at its main CHP station located in Doubravecka, Plzen. 

The objective of the feasibility study is to determine the economic and technical feasibility of an incinerator for CHP at Doubravecka.  The study will analyze facility site selection, facility planning, economics of the project, equipment specifications, and project financing.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $234,500 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, May 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-MNK-02-007

<CONTACT>Carol Abbott, Contract Specialist, Phone 850-882-4294x3414, Fax 850-882-9599, Email abbottc@eglin.af.mil - Carol Abbott, Contract Specialist, Phone 850-882-4294x3414, Fax 850-882-9599, Email abbottc@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>Research and Development sources are sought for the Fuze Air-to-Surface Technology (FAST) Advanced Development program which intends to develop a next generation fuze sensor for use with blast/fragment, penetrating, and low collateral damage unitary warheads.  The objective of this program will be to design a fuze sensor capability that can operate in a tail-mounted configuration on INS/GPS guided weapon platforms that may or may not employ a terminal seeker.  The design goals for this program are as follows: Determine height-of-burst (HOB) above ground contour regardless of target structure, have a selectable HOB that can be programmed through the weapon data bus, operate in weapon systems with closing velocities from 50-2500 meters/second, have a near surface burst (NSB) mode that will detonate the weapon just prior to the warhead impacting the ground, provide real-time closing velocity to penetration fuzes, and provide HOB signal, NSB signal, and/or closing velocity signal to tail mounted fuzes on unitary weapons.  A robust design is needed that will function correctly in the presence of battlefield Electronic Countermeasures (ECM), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), battlefield obscurants (including foliage), and adverse weather.  This program will emphasize development of a robust design backed by high fidelity computer simulations and the demonstration of critical components integrated in brassboard fashion.  Near term program goals include design, fabrication and test of tactical form nose-mounted foliage penetration fuze sensor.  Longer term goals include design, fabrication and test of tail-mounted precision HOB (including foliage penetration) fuze sensor.  The period of performance for this effort is anticipated to be 34 months.  At this time we are requesting information packages from potential sources on their capability to perform design and development of this next generation precision HOB fuze sensor.  All responsible sources may submit a qualification package that will be considered by the agency.   Firms having applicable interest, capability, and background should submit particulars in accordance with Numbered Note 25 to AFRL/MNK, Attention:  Carol Abbott, Building 13, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6810, and reference "MNK-02-007, FAST Advanced Development" on the outside of the package.  Firms will be evaluated on their experience, personnel, and facilities.  Responses to this synopsis must be received within 45 days from the date of publication.  Respondents to this notice will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of information submitted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether or not they are considered a small business concern, or a small disadvantaged business concern, as defined in FAR 52.219-1 for SIC Code 8731 (500 people).  The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based on responses hereto.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address serious concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Routine or administrative questions should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Program Manager.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  For serious concerns only, interested parties are invited to contact Lt. Colonel Mary T. Quinn at mary.quinn@eglin.af.mil or fax number 850-882-9599.  For further information concerning technical aspects, contact Mr. Roger M.

<DESC>OVERSEAS REFUGEE FINGERPRINTING PROGRAM:  The following is a request for information (RFI) to aid the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in market research.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  The INS has a new requirement for a vendor(s) to provide fingerprinting services to individuals seeking refugee status in the USA.  All fingerprinting activities will either be located at U.S. Embassies overseas or at up to 150 off-site refugee camp locations which may be accessible by car and/or aircraft on regularly scheduled outreach travel. Locations that are not accessible on regularly scheduled outreach travel will require special arrangements through the INS.  Initial test sites are  Moscow, Russia; Vienna, Austria; and Nairobi, Kenya.  Up to 35 additional U.S. Embassy sites may be added as required, in Europe, Asia, Africa, South and Central America, and Pacific locations.  The majority of sites will be located in Africa and Asia.  All Contractor staff must be U.S. citizens.  The Government will provide fingerprinting equipment/training, and, at specific locations, outreach travel arrangements/security.  Secure office space will be provided at U.S. Embassies within space currently housing INS offices where such space is available.  Where such space is not available, other arrangements will be made by the Government. Work hours/holidays will be those established locally through the  embassy with jurisdiction over the work location.  The INS is interested in learning whether any businesses can provide the following services, consisting of, but not limited to: 1) Provide a corps of fully trained, full- and part-time on-site labor (U.S. citizens) overseas to collect applications, fingerprints, photographs, and signatures of people seeking U.S. immigration benefits.  It is anticipated that the overseas fingerprinting project may be expanded to include the collection of applications and biometric data for other immigration benefits in addition to refugee status.  Labor categories at each site may consist of a mix of site supervisors, quality assurance specialists, fingerprint technicians, linguists, and unarmed security guards. 2) Provide project support, including transportation arrangements, equipment/supplies, and support capacities for Contractor personnel assigned to the overseas fingerprinting sites.  

This is a new program.    The INS is conducting a six-month overseas fingerprinting test using INS personnel.  No workload data is available at this time, although limited workload data may be available during the solicitation phase.

Vendors who respond to this RFI/sources sought  notice will be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  If the Government determines that this requirement is available under GSA Schedule, only GSA schedule holders will be eligible to submit proposals.  INS anticipates providing electronic solicitation copies only.  It is the Government's intention to make ONE award to facilitate standardization of efforts.  Contract award may be made prior to completion of the six-month test.  The total period of performance will be one base year plus four one-year options.  It is anticipated that a contractual vehicle will be awarded, with subsequent calls/task orders placed to activate overseas sites as required.

The Government wishes to provide industry an opportunity to identify potential problem areas, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry that would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing possible cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with this request.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach intended to be proposed but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package.

We are particularly interested in comments from industry on the following 1. Does your business currently have a GSA Schedule or GWAC for this type of support?  If so, please provide your GSA Schedule or GWAC contact information. 2.  Is this type of service suitable as a performance based service contract? 3. Please identify any known regulatory or statutory requirements unique to government contracting and/or overseas contracting that would impede the use of the best commercial buying practices. 4. What acquisition strategies are typically used when acquiring this or similar services? 5.  Contract Type.  Please identify your reasoning for the most appropriate contract type.  What risks do you foresee regarding this type of service?  What contract types are the most common and effective? 6. Business Size.  If you are not a small business, what role, if any, could small business play in accomplishing this type of effort? 7. Given that teaming and subcontracting arrangements are encouraged, is this type of service feasible for one award? 8. Please list any costs that might reasonably be provided for under the contract as Other Direct Costs vs Direct Labor Overhead. 9. Any other comments regarding our course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.

All interested business concerns shall indicate interest in this acquisition by providing the company name, mailing address, point of contact, email address, contract and GSA schedule information for similar services, brochures/information indicating the vendor's capability to provide these services, and replies to questions above, to the contracting officer.

Replies to questions are not mandatory.  Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Requests for Proposals.  The use of information received from industry to complete final statements of work and a resulting solicitation will be at the discretion of the government.  The government will not critique a potential Offeror's information and the RFI/sources sought should not be used by business concerns to market their services.  The government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not reimburse any costs associated with submission of the RFI/sources sought.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, must be identified as such.  Submit responses not later than May 17, 2002 at 1300, via email.  (Attachments must be MS Office 97 compatible).  Point of contact:  Reply to Jeanette Housen, email address:   Jeanette.Housen@usdoj.gov, telephone number (202) 305-3113.  An electronic response is the only accepted method.

<SUBJECT>D -- Department-wide Asset Management Solution
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-OPPM-2-1012
<RESPDATE>052302
<ARCHDATE>06072002
<CONTACT>Shirley Fortune, Contract Specialist, Phone (202) 720-1666, Fax (202) 720-4529, Email Shirley.Fortune@usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture seeks information on the availability of a new Department wide Asset Management solution. This is a Request For Information  (RFI) issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP). USDA will use the information obtained in response to this RFI exclusively to determine the availability and potential cost for a fully integrated asset management solution.  Please ensure that any sensitive or protected information is marked as such.  USDA will re-engineer its business processes to provide best business practice to fully support life cycle management of USDA asset management requirements. USDA seeks an integrated solution which will support the following functions: (1) personal property and fleet management consistent with JFMIP requirements (2) real property management consistent with JFMIP requirements (3) accept procurement data input to establish records (4) financial data output which provide appropriate data for the submission of transaction to JFMIP compliant financial systems, (5) Assist in training, (6) PKI enabled consistent with the USDA security architecture, and (7) provide all  Federal and Department-wide reporting and metrics requirements..  This software must comply with Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) and Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) requirements. Responses shall state whether or not this capability is already contained within available solutions.

GOALS:  The USDA goal is to identify a source for asset management solutions, either commercial or governmental, that would improve the ability of the Department to more efficiently manage the approximately $9B in real property and $3B in personal property.  The asset management solution will provide USDA with the information it needs to manage resources and make informed decisions.  The objectives of the solution include: (1) control of costs and better decisions. (2) elimination of redundant activities. (3) reduced risk of waste, fraud and abuse, and (4) reliable information.

 The Department seeks an end-to-end solution which would include: (1) Direct access by USDA asset management personnel through secure and encrypted solution that validates the user identity and authority through PKI digital signature capability, (2) integration and standardization of data and systems across all of USDA, (3) providing management with access to timely and accurate asset management information, and (4) implementation of advanced technology to provide the greatest capability and an extended life cycle. 

Property comprises the second largest item on the Department's balance sheet and the current systems provide very limited control and assurance of those assets.  The Department requires a property management system that will provide the internal stewardship, internal controls, and integration with its procurement and financial management systems.  USDA owns nearly 22,000 buildings and has over 1,200 space assignments in 766 GSA buildings in over 400 locations.  USDA also owns approximately 190 million acres of land.  The Department currently relies on a stovepipe mixture of GSA- developed and maintained systems and agency homegrown systems and processes.  The GSA systems include the STAR billing system and the Foundation Information for Real Property (FIRM) system.  The majority of real property is accounted for in INFRA, a client server based systems developed by the Forest Service.  The Department also owns and must account for nearly a half million pieces of personal property.  Personal property assets include items such as computers, furniture, lab equipment, vehicles, aircraft, firearms and even horses and mules.  These assets are now tracked in two legacy systems; the Equipment Management Information System (EMIS) and the Property Management Information System (PROP).

USDA also manages related resources such as telecommunications assets and utility usage information in separate systems.  It is envisioned that these functions could be subsumed into a corporate asset management solution.  Additional functions required include the ability to manage telecommunications assets and manage utility information and provide appropriate reports on utility usage for Federal reporting purposes.

ENVIRONMENT:  USDA has several initiatives to upgrade its information technology infrastructure.  These include the Common Computing Environment (CCE) and the Universal Telecommunications Network.

SURVEY OBJECTIVES:  USDA is collecting data to enable it to assess the availability of commercial or governmental solutions for asset management. It seeks to simplify the administration, real use cost of system operation and to integrate the procurement and financial management functions that support asset management.  All solutions must comply with Federal asset management guidance, must maintain appropriate accounting controls, security rules and accessibility rules. 

Objectives of this RFI include obtaining an understanding of and making assessments about appropriate solutions and using that information to develop an overall acquisition strategy to acquire a viable solution to include: (1) Currently available and planned future functional capabilities of the asset management solution consisting of business processes supported, application capabilities, and human engineering and usability testing applied. (2) Currently available technology and planned technology capabilities in the near term (1-3 years) including but not limited to: (a) Fundamental technologies employed, including but not limited to: web-based or client-server architecture; graphical user interface (GUI) and development tools; electronic data interchange  (EDI); support for extensible Markup Language (XML), electronic commerce (EC); digital signatures; security (data and system); Structured Query Language (SQL); TCP/IP; and any others  utilized; (b) Scalability the degree to which the systems support  workgroup operations and how they scale to support enterprise wide data  integration and retrieval; (c) Implementation environment: computer  platform requirements; operating system requirements; application  structure, integration, etc.; data query download/upload capabilities;  (d) Architecture: What architecture options are available for  implementing your application in the USDA environment' Does it  necessitate a client installation or a client independent environment'  If multiple architectures are offered, provide information on  functional application differences. (3) Business/Other: (a) Identify potential for on-line Internet accesses to application software and a test database at vendor's own facility; (b) Identify status and readiness of software or planned readiness dates for future capabilities.

It is requested that interested vendors provide a written response to this request for information regarding an application service provider for a USDA Wide Asset Management Solution within 30 calendar days of this notice. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Three copies of a capability statement must be received not later than 30 days from publication of this synopsis. All responses will be reviewed/evaluated.
