<DESC><p align="left">The product required is the Inverter/Control Assembly Test Set (P/N: 16U4255-1, NSN: 4920-01-097-0452). The test set consists of circuits to functionally test and isolate faults of the inverter/control assembly which consists of a battery control unit, and inverter, and a NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set monitors power inputs from aircraft essential dc buses 1 and 2 and, in the event of loss of these inputs, automatically switches to output of the emergency generator converter unit. In the event the voltage of these power inputs is less than the battery voltage, the inverter will switch to the flight control inverter battery assembly as a source of power. The test set simulates these signals to the inverter/control assembly and monitors outputs of the assembly. The inverter/control assembly can be tested with or without the NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set will simulate both a good and malfunctioning battery assembly. Surplus is acceptable as long as it is new or reconditioned. As long as the equipment is fully functional and operates according to instructions in T.O. 8C3-11-3-7-1, surplus equipment in either state is acceptable.</p>

 The current acquisition strategy is to issue a Firm Fixed Price contract with a basic year and four one year options under FAR 15.  The contemplated period of performance is Dec 2017 thru Dec 2022.

The contractor will be required to meet all small business participation requirements included in the contract and fulfill all the requirements of the subcontracting plan included in the contract.

<DESC>Title: NHLBI Cardiothoracic Surgical Back-up Coverage
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) anticipates posting a request for proposal (RFP) seeking contractor support to provide cardiothoracic surgical back-up coverage, on or about November 15, 2017.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Cardiovascular Intervention Program performs approximately seven to fourteen cases annually of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) - a form of treatment for stenotic coronary arteries commonly associated with coronary heart disease - on patients in the NIH Clinical Center (CC). Although uncommon, major procedural complications associated with PCI can be life threatening and require immediate, invasive surgery. Neither the NHLBI nor the CC has a full-time cardiothoracic surgeon capable of responding to such emergencies. For this reason, the CC requires the NHLBI to have an agreement with a local medical center which ensures around-the-clock access to a qualified cardiothoracic surgeon to perform emergency surgery on NHLBI's PCI patients.</p>
<p>To comply with CC policy, the NHLBI requires around-the-clock cardiothoracic surgical back-up coverage for its patients undergoing PCI treatment. Should an emergency occur with a patient, the NIH will transport the patient from the CC to Contractor's facilities where the patient will receive complete medical attention from Contractor's medical staff including any emergency surgery necessary to resuscitate the patient.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a request for proposals and although one award is anticipated, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP will be available on FedBizOpps and FedConnect. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. It is also the offerors' responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for the release of any amendments to the RFP. This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 622110.</p>

<p>Description of Requirement<br />(1) The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contemplates award of a contract for Snow and Ice Removal Services at the National Weather Service Forecast Office located in Gray, Maine (ME). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 561730. The small business size standard is $7.5 million. The contracting office is contemplating a base year plus four one-year options contract beginning on 1-1-2018. The contractor shall furnish all supervision, labor, materials, supplies and equipment to provide effective and efficient snow, ice, and freezing rain removal services at the National Weather Service Forecast Office (1 Weather Lane Gray, ME). <br />(2) The National Weather Service Office is a 24 hour operation and must have a clear and safe travel path/walkway area during inclement weather conditions for the safety of its employees. Approximated Area Square Footage: The length of the paved access road is approximately fifteen hundred (1500) feet. The approximate area of the parking lot is 6,600 square feet. The approximate area of the apron around the Weather Balloon inflation building is 3,500 square feet. The length of the walkways is approximately 400 feet.<br />(3) The contractor shall: furnish equipment, materials and the personnel which are consistent with the best industry standards for effective and efficient snow removal services; at a minimum, furnish snow plows, blades, blowers, dump truck, shovels, ice picks, snow removal equipment with a blade of 12 feet or greater for snow plowing and availability of a tandem axle dump truck for snow removal.<br />(4) The contractor shall provide complete snow and ice removal services for the NOAA office listed above in accordance with this PWS. It shall be the contractor's responsibility to monitor weather forecasts and conditions and self-initiate removal services. Snow and ice removal services shall be considered "automatic, meaning the contractor shall begin services in accordance with the guidelines in the PWS and contract. A few events may be minor or on the threshold, and the contractor may call the office and see if services are required. There may be days where blowing and drifting of snow require services despite no falling snow occurring.<br />(5) The Contractor shall "automatically" commence plowing and snow removal operations when there is accumulation of two (2) inches of snow and continuously throughout storm (every additional two inches), or any amount of ice. During an event, the contractor shall ensure that the necessary equipment and manpower are at the site and continue with the performance of the snow removal. The goal of the plowing/removal is to show bare pavement with no more than 2" of accumulated snow/sleet/ice at any time on the parking area, roadways, driveways, handicap spaces, and around the Radar site and Weather Balloon inflation building. In addition, plowing and/or removal of snow as needed to provide access to exterior generator building, fuel storage tank, trash enclosure, telephone equipment hut, and exterior equipment pad. The Contractor shall ensure there is a clear path from the weather balloon facility overhead doors to the post used to prepare the weather balloon equipment with a 4 foot clearance around the post and no snow banking. If needed, the Contractor shall shovel areas that the snowplow cannot remove.<br />(6) An application of salt/sand/chemical shall be applied to the cleared areas to reduce hazardous conditions. The contractor shall use due diligence when spreading salt/sand to prevent excessive disbursements on pavement. The contractor shall be responsible for cleanup of any excessive disbursement of salt/sand.<br />When icy conditions exist (sleet/freezing rain, freezing drizzle, black ice), the contractor shall "automatically" apply salt/sand to the parking and driving areas in sufficient amounts to ensure safe walking and driving areas and to reduce safety hazards due to freezing rain and sleet.<br />(7) Snow should be pushed or mechanically blown beyond paved areas of the parking lot and road to prevent eventual encroaching of paved areas from multiple snow events. In the event this is not possible contractor shall make arrangements for disposal and/or removal of snow off site to an approved snow landfill if room is not available at the current location and/or ponding of melting snow occurs on paved areas.<br />(8) During a major snow event, Contractor shall remove snow continuously for every 2 additional inches during a storm seven days per week, between the hours of 0500 to 2300. Special attention should be paid to the following times: 7 a.m., 3p.m. and 10p.m. This is typically when shift changes occur and the road from Rt. 231 into the parking lot and sidewalks must be clear for employee safety. Special salting/sanding attention is needed at the base of Weather Lane where it meets route 231. This area is at the base of a hill and poses a danger of vehicles sliding onto route 231 if they can't stop due to poor road conditions.<br />Note: For events that require post storm clean up, including snow/ice buildup in/or along parking lot &amp; roadway that create hazardous conditions, the contractor shall provide final plowing/removal/sand &amp; salting services within 36 hours of the end of the event. Examples include: snow encroaching into parking lot, narrowing of roads, obstruction of vision, slippery conditions etc.).<br />(9) A Snowfall event is defined as: The total accumulation of snow as indicated by the National Weather Service for the area of Gray, Maine from the beginning to the end of a snowfall period and reported by the National Weather Service at: http://www.weather.gov/gyx/. This site shall be used to determine the snowfall in inches. Note that event snowfall may span more than one calendar day. For example it may snow from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. thereby falling on two calendar days.<br />(10) Contractor shall perform all services diligently and in a good, professional and first class manner, using good quality materials, equipment and workmanship and sufficient trained personnel (including supervisors when appropriate) to complete the services in a safe and timely manner which does not unduly interfere with the operation of the Property, the businesses therein and their suppliers. Contractor shall obtain and maintain, at its expense and at all times during the term of the contract, all necessary licenses, permits, training or other authorizations which may be necessary to perform the services. The intent of this requirement is to remove all snow and ice from driveways, parking areas, sidewalks and handicapped accessibility areas. The contractor shall perform snow removal more than once during a snowfall period if needed to keep up with the accumulation of snowfall, however, the basis for payment will be the total snowfall in inches per storm and not the amount of effort expended by the contractor. The contractor shall decide how to use his/her resources to meet the specified outcome.<br />(11) The contractor shall meet with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or designee identified in the contract award, to establish the priorities for starting snow and ice removal services at the start of each season. Regular meetings may also be necessary during the snow season to review the contractor's performance or make necessary adjustments in the priorities for snow and ice removal services. The priority of snow removal can and may be dictated by the COR or designee.<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: Although a "DRAFT" PWS and supporting attachments are being provided, this notice does not constitute a solicitation.

<SOLNBR>N4008517R5068
<CONTACT>Amanda Bricker 757-341-1979
<DESC>This notice does NOT constitute a request for proposal, request for quote, or invitation for bid.  The intent of this synopsis is to make notice of a proposed contract action for a Design-Bid-Build (DBB) Construction Repair of The North and South Helix House Ice Shields Located In Cutler, Maine.
	
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  This solicitation will result in a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract, for the repair of the North and South Helix House Ice Shields located in Cutler, Maine.  The project repairs the North and South Helix House Ice Shields through replacement. In total three (3) new Ice Shields will be replaced. Steel components utilizing a corrosion resistant finish will be used in order to fight future corrosion buildup from constant exposure to the salt air.

Each Helix House has three ice shields; one at each end of the building located above the roof.
  The ice shields consist of exposed structural steel frames that cantilever out and over each of the bushings and antenna cabling to protect them from falling ice. Their primary function is to protect the communications ceramic bushing hub from large chunks of ice routinely falling from approximately 875 above.  The communications ceramic bushing hub is the critical distribution point for cabling from the Helix House to the surrounding antenna array.  The ice shields were inspected and found to be in an advanced state of deterioration with significant structural failures to key components of the ice shields.  

Key components to be repaired include: temporary support, scaffolding, roof protection, testing and inspections, cranes, ice shield plate and supports, structural frames and trusses, corrosion resistant coating systems, column connections, roof patching, platforms and access ladders.

The completion time for this contract is 305 calendar days after award.

This solicitation is being advertised as Unrestricted for full and open competition.
 This is a source selection procurement requiring both non-price (technical and past performance) and price proposals, and will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Source Selection Process at FAR 15.101-2.  The basis for evaluation and evaluation factors for award will be included in the solicitation.  Large business concerns are required to submit a subcontracting plan prior to award of the contract.

In accordance with DFARS 236.204, the magnitude of construction for this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.  The appropriate Northern American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 237130  Power and Communication Line and Related Structures Construction, and the Small Business Size Standard is $36,500,000.

A Sources Sought Notice was issued on 22 September 2017 to determine the capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.
  The Sources Sought notice yielded five (5) responses.  Based upon analysis of the data considered, and in accordance with FAR 19.501(c), the Contracting Officer has determined that there is not a reasonable expectation that an adequate number of Small Business firms would respond to or be qualified to perform the requirements of this solicitation.  NAVFAC Mid-Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with this decision.

The drawings and specifications for this project will be posted with the solicitation and are not available at this time.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 November 2017.  All documents will be in Adobe PDF file format and downloadable from the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website.

Results of Sources Sought

A sources sought was used to conduct market research to determine if qualified small businesses were interested in performing this project.
  The sources sought notice was issued using solicitation number N4425517MKTG1, which was posted on August 24, 2016 with a due date of September 13, 2016.  Only two contractors responded.  Additional outreach was completed including directly contacting small business contractors registered under the appropriate NAICS, resulting in only 2 additional responses.  After a review of all four responses, the Government determined that none of the respondents demonstrated experience in one of the two critical experience elements required by the sources sought.  Based on the market research, it was determined that this procurement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The Small Business Administration concurred with this decision.

This is request for Standard Form 330, not a request for proposal, to provide professional Architectural/Engineering Design Services necessary for a construction project that will correct identified mechanical system deficiencies at the Des Moines VA Medical Center in Des Moines, IA.  No solicitation package will be issued via FBO.  A solicitation will be issued directly to the top-rated firm for which negotiations will commence in accordance with FAR Par 36.  The anticipated A/E Design Services to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Act (Public Law 92-582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA acquisition Regulation 836.6.

2. Mileage Restriction: This procurement is restricted to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) located within a 350- mile driving distance of the Des Moines Health Care System which is located at 3600 30th St., Des Moines, IA 50310.  The 350- mile restriction will be verified by using the shortest driving distance from VA Des Moines to a firm s primary or satellite office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. This radius restriction will be calculated using www.googlemaps.com.  

If said contractor s office is more than the 350- mile driving distance restriction to VACIHCS, the contractor s SF330 package will not be evaluated by the source selection evaluation board (SSEB) and will not be considered for award. This mileage restriction is in compliance with VAAR 805.207.
3. Description:  The Des Moines VA Health Care System is seeking a professional A/E firm to perform all A/E design services required for the design and delivery of drawings, specifications, cost estimates, related studies, and all associated engineering services for a construction project.

The design work shall be performed and or approved by a registered or licensed architect or engineer.  

The Architect-Engineer contract will include investigative services and services for complete design including architectural, structural, mechanical, and electrical systems (with reviews); reproduction of design documents; construction period services; final inspections and as-built drawings.

(m) Instructions for Quote Submittal 

Technical questions shall be addressed via e-mail only to Doug Reed, Contracting Specialist, at frank.tarara@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified in Block 8 of SF 1449.

Pricing, Copy of State-Issued Wholesale Drug Distributor License, and Signed Standard Form (SF 1449) of Solicitation shall be e-mailed to Frank Tarara, Contracting Specialist, at frank.tarara@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified on Block 8 of SF 1449: 

Vendors shall submit pricing on Solicitation Attachment 1 (Quote Spreadsheet) 

Pricing submitted shall be on Microsoft Excel format of Quote Spreadsheet. Alternate formats, including PDF format, will not be accepted. Vendors proposing alternate National Drug Codes (NDC) for items and/or alternate delivery dates for items shall list these on the Quote Spreadsheet.

Vendors shall submit copy of State-Issued  Wholesale Drug Distributor License

VA follows U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) regulations to ensure reputable, properly licensed wholesale drug distributors.

For DSCSA purposes, generally any entity that engages in the distribution of a drug to a person other than a consumer or patient or receipt of a drug by a person other than the consumer or patient  is considered a wholesale distributor. See section 581(29) & 503(e)(4)) of the DSCSA. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and should be licensed as a wholesale distributor. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and shall be licensed as a wholesale distributor. 

Third party logistics providers (3PL) are not eligible to submit a quote. A 3PL is defined in the DSCSA as an entity which  provides or coordinates warehousing, or other logistics services of a product in interstate commerce on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser of a product, but does not take ownership of the product nor have responsibility to direct the sale.  Because the Government is seeking firms to procure drugs for the VA, by definition, 3PLs do not take ownership nor have the responsibility to direct the sale of the drugs. Therefore, 3PLs are not eligible. 

This is also applicable in regards to vendors citing  drop shipment  provisions of the DSCSA as the reason for licensure not required. Section 582(f) of the FD&C Act exempts wholesale distributors who,  do not physically handle or store product,  from certain provisions of section 582 involving product tracing and product identifiers. While the  drop shipment  description may apply to the awardee(s), it does not exempt them from the requirement that they be licensed as wholesale distributors. 

3) Vendors shall sign and submit SF 1449 of solicitation. By signing, vendor acknowledges all solicitation amendments (if applicable) and certifies IAW FAR 52.209-5 (Representation by Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Tax Liability or Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law) that Vendor: 

Does not have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. 
Vendor, including its officers or agents acting on its behalf, have not been convicted of a felony criminal violation under a Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months 
(End of Provision)

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Interested vendors shall should submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to meet the requirements above and the attached questionnaire to the POC listed below. Proposals are not being requested or accepted at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. <br /><br />The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 334515, Instrument Manufacturing for Measuring and Testing Electricity and Electrical Signals, with a size standard of 750 persons. Respondents should indicate their size in relation to this size standard and indicate socio-economic status (i.e. SB, 8(a), HUBZone, EDWOSB, WOSB, or SDVOSB). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR Clause 52.219-14. Foreign participation will not be permitted. Participation is to be restricted to U.S. contractors.<br /><br />Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's assessment of the questionnaire responses received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small business, or any particular small business program. <br /><br />CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: Interested U.S. vendors should submit a questionnaire response that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide/perform the requirement stated in this notice. The response should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirement. The response must not exceed fifty (50) pages, 8.5" x 11" paper, 12 pitch, Times New Roman font, with a minimum of one (1) inch margins all around. Responses should include the company name, CAGE code, point of contact, address, and phone number. Small businesses with only partial capabilities of this requirement are encouraged to submit their response demonstrating the portion of the requirement they are capable of providing/performing. This information will allow the Government to identify areas of possible breakout or possible subcontracting opportunities.<br /><br />Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: abigail.raney@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "FA2487-18-R-0014, Multi-Spectral Test Set." If this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through e-mail filters at Eglin AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachment. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xsls, or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted. Package sizes greater than 5 megabytes shall be submitted via the Army's Safe Access File Exchange, located at https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding the announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed in this posting. The Government may or may not use any responses to this sources sought as a basis for a subsequent project/requirement. Any project/requirement developed from the sources sought responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FedBizOpps.gov separately. Responses to this sources sought will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to the respondents with respect to any of the information submitted under this sources sought. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; a bid package or solicitation does not exist at this time. In order to protect the integrity of any possible future acquisition, no additional information will be provided and no appointments for presentations will be made in reference to this sources sought.<br /><br />Only government employees will review submitted responses to this sources sought. Respondents are advised that employees of commercial firms under contract with the Government may be used to administratively process submissions and perform other administrative duties requiring access to other contractor's proprietary information. These administrative support contractors include nondisclosure agreements prohibiting their contractor employees from disclosing any information submitted by other contractors or using such information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.<br /><br /><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 3:00 P.M.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information:  Low-Density (lightweight) Ablators 
<SOLNBR>80ARC018AblatorsRFI
<RESPDATE>113017
<CONTACT>Marianne Shelley, Phone 6506044179, Email marianne.shelley@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/ARC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to provide the materials, manufacturing and services described below.<br /><br />NASA is seeking low density ablator materials for use in various spacecraft. The environments the ablators will be exposed to are low with heatfluxes of &lt; 40W/cm2. Current ablator materials have been adequate for current missions to date, but the areal mass is too high for some future potential. It is NASA's goal to source, procure, and/or participate in the development of current or new ablator materials under 0.5 g/cm3. In addition to the low-density requirement, the materials must also be robust enough, in terms of thermal performance and mechanical strength requirements, to withstand planned mission load requirements.
<p>Candidate lightweight ablator information sought includes:<br /><br />1. Composition: broadly define the constituents, resin system and reinforcements. A detailed ingredients list is not required but would be preferred.<br />2. Sustainability: Is availability of all constituents used in the production of the ablator available for the foreseeable future? If a constituent becomes difficult to obtain, a suitable alternative must be proven, through testing and analysis, to perform at least equal in performance in all aspects, to what it is intended to replace.<br />3. Availability: Is the proposed candidate material currently available, under development, or in the planning stages? If not currently available, when will it become available?<br />4. Manufacturing Capability: What are the current capabilities of the manufacturing facility where the proposed ablator material is to be produced? Is this limited by processing hardware, or a material physical limitation? What are the largest dimensions the material can be produced? If limited, can the facility be adapted to produce larger specimens? What is the rate of production capability for a given unit volume? If limited, can the production capacity be increased?<br />5. QA/QC Considerations: Is the manufacturing facility ISO certified? Is there a quality management team as part of the manufacturing process? What measures are in place to ensure a consistent, quality product? Are there acceptance tests? Do you currently produce flight hardware? Are you a supplier to space hardware prime contractors?<br />6. Thermal/Mechanical Properties: Has the proposed ablator material been thoroughly tested to determine thermal and mechanical properties? If so, over what temperature range? Is a property database available and can it be provided? Has the proposed material been tested in an aerothermal environment, or thermal arc-jet facility to ensure proven performance and capabilities? If so, what range of heat fluxes and pressures have been tested? Are test reports available and can they be provided?<br />7. ITAR: Is there a system or process in place to manage International Traffic in Arms Regulations should this become a consideration? How secure is the facility to ensure compliance to these regulations?<br />8. Integration: Because this is one of the more difficult and time-consuming aspects of spacecraft development, it is desired to know the characteristics of the material with respect to handling and integration into a carrier structure. Describe the conformability, flexibility or rigidity, machinability, gap filler requirements if applicable, coefficient of expansion, methods of attachment to the substructure, etc. Please provide any relevant information on installation approaches developed or proven.</p>
<p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>If available, provide any study results or current capabilities you have but are not mentioned in the RFI description data that you think pertinent to advancing the state of the art in lightweight ablators.</p>
<p>In addition to the information requested above, describe the extent to which existing proven manufacturing approaches can be leveraged to minimize technical and schedule risk to a space program.</p>
<p>Guidelines for RFI Response:</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: W56KGY-18-R-E002<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, is conducting this RFI to identify potential sources for the installation of Reliability, Maintainability and Improvement (RMI) kits into the Army's Counter Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) AN/VLQ-12 (V)3 (Duke V3) chassis. The chassis will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The completed RMI assemblies (Duke V4) will undergo a Production Acceptance Test (PAT) prior to delivery to the Government. The Government's acquiring activity is the Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence &amp; Electronic Warfare &amp; Surveillance (IEW&amp;S), Program Manager (PM) Electronic Warfare &amp; Cyber (EW&amp;C), Product Director (PD) Electronic Attack (EA).</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Duke system provides force protection against RCIED threats for occupants in wheeled and tracked vehicle platforms and within the vicinity of fixed site positions. Requirements have been identified for up to 660 Reliability and Maintainability Improvement (RMI) kits to be installed into GFE Army CREW Duke V3 chassis and for the purchase of up to 660 Enhanced Remote Control Units (eRCU). Currently, the procurement of the kit parts, the installation, and all associated testing (PAT testing with troubleshooting and repair until PAT is passed) is performed by SRCTec Inc, 5801 East Taft Road, North Syracuse, NY. The kits have been purchased under contract W56KGY-15-D-0022 and are provided as GFP for the assembly and testing activities performed under the Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) Contract W15P7T-10-D-D415 Task Order KY06. The final assembly shall commence immediately after award of up to the 660 RMI kits and purchase of the eRCUs.<br />The RMI initiative leverages the RESET process by using Recapitalization, which is essentially a rebuild effort that extends the CREW Duke's useful life by returning it to a zero-hour condition with an upgraded performance specification. Reliability and maintainability are both improved, with a dividend of improved performance, while addressing parts obsolescence issues. The eRCU is a critical component of the 22 part RMI Kit. It is an active extension of the front panel controls of the CREW Duke system. The eRCU makes it possible for the operator to set various parameters, filters, and to monitor detections from a remote and more convenient location during tactical operations.</p>
<p>Following the installation of the RMI Kit parts into the chassis and integration of the eRCU, each unit must go through PAT per the current PAT Plan &amp; Procedure. This includes a Pre-Highly Accelerated Stress Screening (HASS) Functional Test with the current Automated Test Equipment (ATE), HASS Environmental Screening, and Post-HASS Functional Testing with the current ATE. It should be noted that the Government does not own the software data rights for either ATE or HASS automation. The ATE and all facilities, Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) test fixtures, and automation for PAT (including the HASS chamber, benchtop test equipment, and ATE) must be developed / procured using contractor funding. GFE is not available for these items. For any Duke system assembled which does not pass the PAT, troubleshooting and repair must be performed, until the unit is able to meet the PAT requirements. Each unit must be shipped with PAT data, both in an electronic database and via paper printouts.</p>
<p>This office intends on issuing a ceiling increase to contract W56KGY-15-D-0022 held by SRCTec, Inc. This contract currently provides for the purchase of 592 kits. The ceiling increase would allow the Government to add the eRCU component to complete the kit as well as procure up to 660 completed systems. This addendum to the existing contract allows the Government to efficiently procure the Duke V4. These component kit parts must be procured and assembled prior to 30 September 2018. The Government requests that parties who object to this ceiling increase submit white papers that fully describe their ability to perform/deliver the above work. The Government does not intend to conduct one-on-one discussions.</p>
<p>NOTE THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT DISCUSSION OR REQUEST DEMONSTRATION, NOR IS IT LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR EXPENSES INCURRED IN RESPONDING TO THIS RFI.</p>
<p>Response Format:</p>
<p>The paper must include company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number; business size, unique qualifiers (e.g. large, foreign, small disadvantage, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.).</p>
<p>RFI responses are limited to 3 pages, excluding cover page, administrative pages. Responses shall be written using 10 point Times New Roman, single spaced, with one (1) inch margins in Microsoft Word Office 2007 compatible format.</p>
<p>The Government acknowledges its obligation under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any proprietary (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response-see item 3 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, identify where the restrictive legends proprietary portion begins and where the proprietary portion ends.</p>

The onboard Mission Computer (MSC) provides the centralized computing and integration hub for onboard sensors and Line Replaceable Units (LRUs). The MSC utilizes those sensors, LRUs, and user input in conjunction with integrated fire control software to automate Howitzer operations. The Chief of Section Display (CSD) is the primary display used to operate the DFCS. The Technical Documentation for this procurement will be Distribution C, and vendors will be required to fill out DD Form 2345 prior to receipt of technical data related to this sources sought.</p>

<DESC><p>Market Survey for the procurement of 5 Axis Milling Machines</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.</p>

<DESC>Partnership Opportunity Document (POD) For NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Flight Systems for Discovery 14 Missions dated November 2017
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction and Scope</p>
<p>NASA's GSFC is considering missions to Solar System targets for the upcoming Discovery 14 Announcement of Opportunity (AO). We are seeking partners for spacecraft, navigation, major subsystems and mission operations center for potential science mission proposals to this opportunity. The potential GSFC Discovery missions are designed to meet the science goals of the Discovery program (those outlined in the latest NRC Decadal Survey for Planetary Exploration).</p>
<p>GSFC mission teams will be submitting proposals to the Discovery AO currently planned for release in CY 19.  The AO will be a two-step process, with the first proposal response primarily focused on the scientific merit and technical feasibility of the proposed mission and its associated scientific investigation.  The initial submissions will then be down-selected after formal peer review, and the resultant subset of proposals will be funded to perform Phase A mission concept studies.  During Phase A, proposals will be expanded and refined to detail the entire end-to-end mission life cycle concept, with greater attention to engineering implementation, cost, and schedule.</p>
<p>This partnership opportunity is issued to select partners to team with GSFC Discovery mission concept teams for Step 1 proposal submittal; to assist in the Phase A concept studies if the mission is down-selected; and to provide a flight-qualified system should the mission be selected for flight by NASA Headquarters. For the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the Step 1 proposal, there will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners.  Funding may be available for Phase A and subsequent phases should the mission be competitively selected for those additional phases.  NASA's GSFC reserves the option to not select any teaming partners under this POD offering on the basis of materials received.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.0 Mission Overview</p>
<p>The likely mission cost cap for the Discovery AO will be ~$450M (FY18), not including launch vehicle or Phase E, so cost is an important issue for the conceptual mission designs. Mission targets could include all planets and small bodies noted in the latest NRC Decadal Survey for Planetary Exploration.</p>
<p>More detailed information will be provided to those responding with a Notice of Interest (NOI) to this POD.  A Notice of Interest (intentionally not called a notice of intent) does not obligate an organization to provide a POD response.</p>
<p>3.0 Pre-selection Support</p>
<p>3.1 Step 1 Proposal Support</p>
<p>SOW:  It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources to help develop and write the Mission concept proposal in response to the AO in the area of the spacecraft, related subsystems and mission implementation.  This will involve meeting with the relevant scientists and the mission engineering team in order to: (1) help define the end-to-end performance requirements, including interfaces to the instruments or spacecraft, depending on the component being proposed; (2) define the flight system architecture; (3) identify study topics; and (4) predict performance and quantify risks. This will include cost estimation for all mission phases.  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last until the submission of the initial proposal.</p>
<p>3.2 Phase A Study and Phase A Proposal Support</p>
<p>SOW:  If the mission is selected for a Phase A study, the proposal team will receive funding to conduct a Phase A study and submit a detailed Concept Study Report (CSR) to NASA.  The respondent providing the spacecraft or navigation subsystem for the mission may be allocated a portion of this funding.  The respondent will be expected to contribute to designing, documenting, and costing the spacecraft or navigation design, fabrication, integration and testing for inclusion in the final Discovery Concept Study Report (as specified in the AO).  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 15 months after Phase A selection.</p>
<p>3.3 POD Response Instructions for Pre-Selection Support</p>
<p>The respondent shall:</p>
<p>1)	Demonstrate understanding and flight experience in the design, fabrication, integration and testing of the Planetary science mission spacecraft and flight subsystem:<br />&bull;	Identify example target mission the response is intended for, <br />&bull;	For each target mission, identify assumed mission and system requirements for the target mission and your team's response to addressing those requirements, <br />&bull;	Highlight particularly critical or challenging areas for the design of the spacecraft or system,<br />&bull;	Provide a technical summary/description of the proposed hardware including relevant heritage,<br />&bull;	Describe what types of capabilities and cost benefits the spacecraft or subsystem provides for the intended target mission.</p>
<p>2)	Provide any recommended potential study topics related to the spacecraft or navigation.</p>
<p>3)  Identify the pertinent missions for which the respondent has provided support for proposal writing in the area of spacecraft design, fabrication, integration and testing:<br />&bull;	Provide data on scope of the spacecraft design, the role played in the proposal process, and the portions of the proposal written or provided assistance in writing, and provide a customer reference POC.</p>
<p>4.0 Development Support</p>
<p>SOW:  At the end of Phase A another down-select occurs. If the mission is selected for development and launch, the respondent will be responsible for the design, development, and test of the spacecraft or navigation system.  The respondent is responsible for:  identifying the spacecraft or subsystem requirements and providing all aspects of the spacecraft or navigation system.  The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 46-64 months.  The date will depend upon selection timelines and budget allocations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POD Response Instructions for Development Support</p>
<p>The respondent shall:</p>
<p>1)	Describe your team's experience in similar spacecraft applications.</p>
<p>2)	Identify available design and modeling capabilities required to support development of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>3)	Identify fabrication and testing facilities that will be required to support development and test of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>4)	Identify missions successfully supported in this capacity.<br />&bull;	Provide information on recent similar spacecraft designed and delivered, and how that experience is applicable to the mission.  Basic information on scope of work, and how well the fielded spacecraft met the requirements (cost and technical, and how well they met the proposed schedules).</p>
<p>5)	Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline for the scope of the design, fabrication, and testing of the spacecraft.  This ROM will not be considered a binding commitment, but will serve as a consideration during the partnership evaluation.</p>
<p>Due to the rigid cost cap for Discovery missions, the cost range for the spacecraft will be an important consideration.  The respondent is invited to comment on the reasonableness of the placeholder cost.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified sources that are: Indian Small Business Economic Enterprises (ISBEEs) and other than small Indian Economic Enterprises (IEEs); and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, 621112, for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition set-aside.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) suffer disproportionately from behavioral health issues, especially those related to trauma and suicide. These behavioral health issues often have broad individual and community impacts. Despite the need, access to behavioral health care, particularly specialty care, can be very difficult to obtain in many communities. The co-occurrence of mental health and substance abuse disorders among AI/ANs is over 70% of those presenting for treatment. However, providers trained to treat both concurrently are highly specialized and difficult to recruit and retain. In order to maximize the contractor's time, the contractor will serve sites across the country via tele-video.<br /><br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) is seeking contractor support to provide tele-psychiatry services for IHS beneficiaries at I/T/U facilities across the Indian Health System. Under this contract, the contractor is required to have knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of a broad range of psychiatric and addiction problems across the lifespan. The contractor will provide psychiatry services as allowed for by their license, certifications, training, and by site privileging. The contractor will typically provide services in outpatient settings, but may provide services in inpatient settings. Major duties for this position are to independently provide the full range of psychiatric assessments, treatment, and prescribe psychotropic medications to the patients that are seen.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INFORMATION</p>

<p>In order to respond to this notice, interested firms should address the depth and breadth of professional and technical capabilities, and must be able to clearly convey their experience and/or ability to perform in the following areas, which are identified as core services.

Responders SHALL address each of the following for their submission to be considered a response to this notice:</p>

<DESC>01 November 2017<br />Solicitation Number: W9133L-18-R-PRID<br />Notice Type: Sources Sought
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation)</p>
<p><br />ARNG Pride Tririga Technical Services at Arlington, VA.  The United States Army National Guard Operational Contracting Branch, NGB-AQ, is seeking information on potential sources and industry feedback on the attached Draft Performance Work Statements for the management of the National Guard Bureau's Pride Tririga servers and data that supports the 54 states and territories.  Per DFARS 207.170, the Government is seeking feedback on the feasibility of consolidating of two current contracts, W9133L-12-F-0086 and W91QUZ-06-D-0010-2Y07, under one contract and what benefits in terms of Cost; Quality; Acquisition cycle; Terms and conditions; and any other benefit that would result in the combining of these requirements.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing services for multiple locations within the United States in accordance with Department of Defense standards and applicable local, state, and Federal laws.  Information regarding these contracts can be found within the FPDS-NG website.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Draft Performance Work Statement has all of the information listed in regards to the technical requirements for this effort.  As a reminder, these are drafts and estimates which are subject to be changed.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 541513 -- Computer Facilities Management Services.  The SBA Size Standard is $27,500,000.00.  The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is D301 - IT AND TELECOM- FACILITY OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.  The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.  No set-aside decision has been made.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.  The Army National Guard anticipates an acquisition for a base and four option years.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.  Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments.  The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below.  Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice.  Failure to provide a complete response may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>3. This sources sought inquiry is for all potential vendors.  A set-aside may be determined at a later time.</p>
<p>Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed via email to MAJ Jeremy Goldsmith, NGB-AQ, at jeremy.m.goldsmith.mil@mail.mil.</p>

If so, please provide the relevant GSA contract number.</p>
<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort: The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not been decided; however, the Army National Guard is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for small businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention all potential respondents:  If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement.  Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II.  Request for Information:<br />If possible, please provide answers to the following questions.</p>
<p>1. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that has the effect of limiting competition among potential vendors?</p>
<p>2. Is there an alternate NAICS that you believe is more appropriate for this requirement? If so, what is the NAICS and why?</p>
<p>3. Is there anything in the PWS that has the effect of creating duplicative of unnecessary costs to the Government?  Do you have any additional comments on the PWS?</p>
<p>4. Based on your experience, are the requested services commercial in nature as defined by FAR 2.101?  If so, why, and are there established catalog or market prices for these services?</p>
<p>5. Based on your experience, are there benefits to consolidating these two requirements under one contract?  If so, what benefits in terms of Cost; Quality; Acquisition cycle; Terms and conditions; and any other benefit that would result in the combining of these requirements?</p>

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />The Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS&amp;IMF) is seeking potential sources to provide Bagsuits that allow breathability while maintaining its waterproof integrity. The work will be performed under NAICS 313310, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills.<br /><br />The purpose of switching to this wetsuit is in an effort to mitigate heat stress related issues. The PVC and polyurethane-coated nylon wetsuits currently do not have breathable properties; instead, they do just the opposite and retain heat. Suits with vents installed on them do not support heat exhalation. The vents are only beneficial when used in conjunction with air-fed hoods that allow excess air-pressure to vent so that the suits do not become over pressurized. PSNS does not anticipate using air-fed hoods in conjunction with the wetsuits. </span></span></span></p>
<p>The purpose of this market survey is to identify if supplies are available as a commercial item to identify qualified businesses that are capable of performing this effort, and to assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. To further refine source list for efficiency purposes, this market survey request also requests that interested vendors to provide capability statement package (MS Word Document). The 15 page limitation does not include the cover letter. Vendors are requested to provide the following information in their capability statements:</p>
<p>A. An overview of your company's management structure.</p>
<p>B. A summary of knowledge, skills and abilities to provide/fabricate this supply.</p>
<p>C. A list of three separate similar type contracts/orders in which the same type of manufacturing has been performed.</p>
<p>D. Describe your company's capabilities in performing this fabrication and the ability to perform to exact measurements and design for fabrication and approval.</p>
<p>E. State whether or not your company has a GSA Schedule, and if so provide the contract number with the Schedule.<br />F. State whether or not your company is a small business or large in addition to the Cage Code.</p>
<p>Questions covering this requirement are to be forwarded to jacqueline.edgerton@navy.mil. Responses are due by November 14, 2017. This request does not constitute a request for quotation or proposal. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information. Furthermore, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">The USITC's mission is to: (1) administer U.S. trade remedy laws within its mandate in a fair and objective manner; (2) provide the President, the United States Trade Representative (USTR), and Congress with independent, quality analysis, information, and support on matters relating to tariffs and international trade and competitiveness; and (3) maintain the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in November.   <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties November enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.
<p>The Open Period for November is November 1, 2017 to November 7, 2017, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.

Salient Characteristics (Site- Riter 8 Ultra Sound System Brand Name or EQUAL):

Site Rite 8 Has 3 Exclusive Features Needed:

1.) Controls on the probe handle to stay sterile during the procedure. These controls allow the health care professional to adjust pertinent settings from the probe during the procedure.  No other ultrasound machine has this.

2.) Probe has pinpoint GT guides which is proprietary to the Site Rite 8 and Bard. Pinpoint GT is designed to improve the ultrasound-guided needle insertion experience by providing visual feedback of needle trajectory and needle tip positioning in relation to the structure of interest. This can help with many of our patients that have difficult to access veins.

3.) Vein to Catheter measurement built into machine.  This allows the health care professional to assess how much of the patient's blood vessel is occupied by the catheter.  Having this Site Rite 8 only feature allows health care professionals to use the most appropriate sized catheter for the patient.  Occupying more than 45% of the patient's blood vessel can lead to other significant events and having this technology will help us avoid that.

Contracting Activity: Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) - Fort Gordon, GA.<br />2. Description of Action:<br />Nature: New Requirement Follow-on Requirement<br />Mod to Existing Purchase Order/Contract Number<br />Pricing: Firm-Fixed Price Time &amp; Materials Cost<br />Funds: OMA Other Funds:<br />An acquisition plan is not required because this procurement does not meet the threshold at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 207.103(d)(i)(B).<br />Name of Proposed Contractor: Dani Instruments, Inc. Street Address: 257 Simarano Drive<br />City, State: Marlborough, MA 01752<br />Phone: (508)-281 - 6232<br />3. Description of Services or Supplies:<br />The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC) requests the sole source purchase of a Dani DiscovIR-GC gas chromatograph - solid phase infrared spectrometer system.<br />Total Dollar Value: $152,876.00<br />4. Authority Cited: Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items, 41 U.S.C. 1901 (or 41 U.S.C. 1903 for Special Emergency Procurement) as implemented by FAR Subpart 13.5:<br />Unusual and compelling urgency Exclusive licensing agreements Industrial mobilization<br />Other: Sole Source<br />5. Reasons for Authority Cited:<br />a. The Defense Forensic Science Center (DFSC) located at the Gillem Enclave in Georgia, provides forensic laboratory services to the Department of Defense investigative agencies and other Federal law enforcement agencies. The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory (USACIL) Chemistry and Firearms - Drug Chemistry Section (CFA-DC) require the sole source purchase of an DANI gas chromatograph - solid phase<br />Control # Gordon-2017-18<br />-2-<br />direct deposit fourier transform infrared spectrometer system (DiscovIR-GC) for forensic casework to assist in providing investigative seized drug identification evidence to law enforcement agencies DoD and nationwide. The replacement of the current 6 year old model is required as part of our lifecycle replacement program in support of the laboratory's mission and to ensure continuity of operations.<br />b. Dani Instruments, Inc. has the sole rights to the solid phase FTIR direct deposition chromatography onto cryogenic ZnSe disk technology upon which the DiscovIR-GC system is based. This piece of equipment cannot be purchased from another company.<br />The vendor provided a proprietary letter<br />c. Dani DiscovIR-GC gas chromatograph - solid phase infrared spectrometer system is utilized in the USACIL CFA Branch. Purchase of this system will negate any training needed on software or hardware as all users are familiar with the existing interfaces used on this system. Additionally, this brand will fall under the umbrella of the already existing service contract set up with manufacturer for preventative maintenance and service. The current model has demonstrated reliability and consistency for the types of analyses performed in this center.<br />d. Internal validation of the current DiscovIR-GC for forensic casework applications was completed by USACIL CFA-DC Branch. Validation is the process in which a procedure and associated instrumentation is evaluated to determine efficacy and reliability for forensic casework analysis. Internal validation is the accumulation of analytical test data within a laboratory to demonstrate that the procedure is performing as expected. The accuracy, reproducibility, and sensitivity of these instruments was established, and retained on file at the laboratory, as required by the laboratory's accrediting body. Large portions of this initial validation study will be directly applicable to the proposed system negating the need to perform a complete validation study of a competing technology, thus saving the government time, manpower, and money.<br />e. An extensive spectral library of controlled substances has been acquired using solid phase FTIR direct deposition chromatography onto cryogenic ZnSe disk technology via the current system at USACIL CFA-DC. This library is specific to this spectral acquisition technology and therefore will be directly transferable to the new proposed system negating the need to build a new compound library. This will save the government time, manpower, and money.<br />6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:<br />To promote competition the MICC-Fort Gordon will continue to synopsize and conduct market research to ensure there are no other vendors that can provide the requirement.<br />7. Actions to Increase Competition:<br />DFSC research scientists are continually researching sources of information and services to enable forensic examiners to conduct effective and reliable examinations. Market research consists of internet research, literature reviews, discussions with vendors and other professional resources, attending forensic science and technical conferences and industry events. If DFSC identifies a similar requirement, every effort will be made to compete it to the maximum extent possible.<br />Control # Gordon-2017-18<br />-3-<br />To increase competition the MICC-Fort Gordon will continue to synopsize and conduct market research to ensure there are no other vendors that can provide the requirement. The Government issued a sole source synopsis. No responses were received.<br />8. Market Research: Research was conducted on the internet and General Services Administration (GSA) GSA Advantage website during July 2017 by DFSC staff. Continual review of new products and technologies is conducted by examiners within the Chemistry and Firearms Branch in order to determine the best commercially available product reliable for the task. No other supplier of an instrument based on solid phase FTIR direct deposition chromatography onto cryogenic ZnSe disk technology was found. A quote from Dani Instruments, Inc. for the purchase of a DiscovIR-GC system was obtained along with a statement that this technology is proprietary.<br />The unique salient characteristics for DiscovIR-GC system include:<br />Direct deposition of chromatogram onto cryogenic ZnSe sample disk Built in FTIR detector<br />4000 - 600 cm-1 IR range 4 cm-1 IR resolution<br />Sample in solid phase during detection<br />Transmittance through ZnSe disc and sample IR acquisition<br />&lt; 0.8 miliabsorbacne units peak to peak noise<br />9.

Technical / Requirements Certification: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which is included in this abbreviated J&amp;A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br />11. Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: I hereby determine that the anticipated cost or price to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable.<br />This determination will be made using the following: cost analysis price Analysis should cost IGCE audit: (identify the audit type) other:<br />Control # Gordon-2017-18<br />-4-<br />As a part of this basis, certified cost or pricing data is not required because the item and/or services being acquired are considered commercial.<br />Typed Name: Suzanne Mattingly Date:<br />Title: Contracting Officer Signature:<br />12.

<DESC>1.0 Introduction and Scope<br />This proposal opportunity is for a NASA Second Stand Alone Missions of Opportunity Notice (SALMON-2) for a 2016 Astrophysics Explorer Mission of Opportunity (MoO), under Announcement of Opportunity (AO) NNH12ZDA006O. NASA's GSFC is seeking a partner to provide a flight and engineering version Main Electronics Box (MEB) and a flight and engineering version Mechanism Control Electronics (MCE) to be used with a telescope for a Step 2 proposal. The potential GSFC MoO instrument is designed to meet the science goals of the Explorer Program, as currently understood.<br />The International Space Station Transient Astrophysics Observatory (ISS-TAO) was selected in the first step of a two-step process in July 2017.<br />The following key dates are from the AO:<br />Concept Study Reports Due 24 May 2018<br />Site Review Fall 2018<br />Final Selection Late 2018<br />This partnership opportunity is issued to select a teaming partner for the preparation of the GSFC Explorer candidate MoO instrument concept for the proposal submittal. The major flight system component GSFC is interested in finding partners for is an MEB and a MCE.<br />There will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners for the portion of this partnership opportunity dealing with the preparation of the initial proposal submission to the Explorer Program Element Appendix (PEA). Full funding will be available for subsequent phases should the MoO instrument/mission be competitively selected for those additional phases. Additionally, release of this POD does not commit GSFC to enter into a partnership.<br />2.0 Mission Overview<br />Desired telescope flight system - GSFC is interested in finding a partner for a MEB and a MCE for the referenced Astrophysics Explorer MoO. No other subsystems of the instrument are part of this POD.<br />Detailed information on the mission parameters of potential Explorer missions will be provided to those responding with a Notice of Interest. A Notice of Interest (it is intentionally not called a notice of intent) does not obligate an organization to provide a POD response.
<p>3.0 Pre-selection Support<br />3.1 Initial Proposal Support<br />SOW: It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources to help develop and write the Mission proposal in response to the PEA in the area of the MEB and MCE design, related subsystems, and mission implementation. This will involve meeting with scientists and the overall mission engineering team to: (a) help define the end-to-end performance and interface requirements; (b) identify study topics; and (c) predict performance. This will include cost estimation for all mission phases. The period of performance for this interval is expected from POD selection to Step 2 proposal submission (~11 months), starting approximately December 2017.<br />3.2 Phase A Study and Phase A Proposal Support<br />POD Response Instructions for Pre-Selection Support<br />1. Demonstrate understanding and demonstrated experience in the design, fabrication, integration and testing of the MEB and MCE under consideration:<br />a. Identify the means of addressing system requirements your team assumes are likely to exist and tasks the system is intended for,<br />b. Highlight particularly critical or challenging areas for the design,<br />c. Provide a technical summary/description of the proposed hardware including relevant heritage<br />2. Identify fabrication and testing facilities that will be required to support development and test of the MEB and MCE.<br />3. Indicate the level of resources to be allocated for the proposal phase.<br />a. Discuss skills that will be provided, the appropriate level of conceptual design, and all relevant analyses and trade studies.<br />4. Identify the pertinent missions for whom they have previously provided support for proposal writing in the area of MEB and MCE design, fabrication, integration and testing:<br />a. Provide data on scope of the MEB and MCE, the role that they played in the proposal process, and the portions of the proposal they have written or provided assistance in writing. Provide a customer reference POC.<br />b. Describe how this proposal role mapped to their role in the end instrument development. If the scope changed, explain why.<br />5) The respondent will be expected to contribute to documenting and costing the MEB and MCE for inclusion in the final Concept Study Report.<br />4.0 Development Support<br />SOW: If the mission is selected for development and launch, the respondent will be responsible for the design, development, and test of the MEB and MCE and for launch and early orbit check out leading to full scientific operations. The respondent is responsible for identifying the MEB and MCE requirements and providing all aspects of the MEB and MCE (either directly, or through purchasing or teaming arrangements). The period of performance for this interval is expected to last approximately 36-48 months, starting in early 2019. This date may change depending upon selection timelines and budget allocations.<br />POD Response Instructions for Development Support<br />The respondent shall:<br />1) Identify available design and modeling capabilities required to support development of the MEB and MCE. Describe the level of experience with similar MEB and MCEs for relevant personnel.<br />2) Identify fabrication and testing facilities that will be required to support development and test of the MEB and MCE.<br />3) Proposers must have experience of flying MEB and MCEs on the International Space Station (ISS). Identify previous MEBs and MCEs provided that have flown on ISS missions<br />&#61623; Identify which missions they have successfully supported in this capacity and provide a customer reference POC.<br />&#61623; Provide information on recent similar MEB and MCE designed and delivered, and describe how that experience is applicable to this mission. This shall include basic information on scope of work, how well the fielded MEB and MCE met the cost and technical requirements, and how well the fielded MEB and MCE met the proposed schedules.<br />4) Provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and timeline for the scope of the design, fabrication, and testing of the MEB and MCE. Neither ROM nor timeline will be considered a binding commitment, but will serve as a consideration during the partnership evaluation. In consideration of the rigid cost cap for Explorer missions, the cost ROM for the MEB and MCE will be an important consideration. The respondent is invited to comment on the reasonableness of the ROM cost estimate.<br />5) Present ideas and methods of keeping costs low and the risk of cost growth low, including how they would utilize existing open market hardware to minimize costs and provide a more robust system.<br />5.0 Additional Information<br />For pre-selection or development support, the respondent can provide any additional information on any other pertinent missions for which his/her establishment, and any partners/vendors proposed, have provided MEBs and MCEs, and identify the relevant details of similar systems. The respondent may also identify any other ideas and related activities, which your organization is or has been involved with, and the significance of that activity to this mission.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD), Norfolk Office, using the procedures set forth in FAR Part 13, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Nidec Motor Corporation, located at 7555 E Pleasant Valley Rd Bldg 100, Independence, OH 44131, for an  Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract for inspection and maintenance services for highly specialized main propulsion drives and control systems onboard the NOAA Ships Oscar Dyson and Henry B. Bigelow.</p>
<p>The NOAA ships Oscar Dyson and Henry B. Bigelow have highly specialized main propulsion drives and control systems allowing them to operate as highly effective, ultra-quiet fisheries survey vessels. The propulsion motors on these vessels are specially constructed and balanced to reduce noise and vibration. This proprietary design allows scientists to use hydroacoustic methods for surveying marine life, and significantly reduces changes in the natural behavior of animals owing to the ship noise. In order to maintain and maximize the useful life of these systems NOAA is looking for the original equipment manufacturer to inspect and maintain the vessels' main propulsion and control systems. This is to include proper function of the motors, drives, control systems, and any components that support function of these components. NOAA intends to award an IDIQ contract with a base ordering year and four subsequent one year ordering periods.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 811310, Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment (Except Automotive and Electronic) Repair and Maintenance, with a business size standard $7,500,000.00.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes.  However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  A statement of capabilities must be received by 12:00 PM EST on November 7, 2017.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services.  The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.  Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Contract Specialist Alex Cooper at alexander.cooper@noaa.gov by 12:00 PM EST on November 7, 2017.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Addenda: <br />1. Basis for Award</p>
<p>The Government's selection for Purchase Order awardee will be made on the basis of the lowest priced quote meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, lowest price technically acceptable source selection process. The Purchase Order will be awarded to the offeror who is deemed responsible by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with the General Standards for contractor responsibility at FAR 9.104-1, and whose proposal conforms to all of the solicitation's requirements (including stated terms, conditions, representations, certifications, and all other information) and is assessed, based on the evaluation factors below, to represent the lowest price technically acceptable. <br />2.0 Evaluation Factors &amp; Evaluation Approach<br />All proposals will be evaluated in a fair and consistent manner. All proposals will be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel. The offeror whose proposal is determined to provide the lowest priced proposal that meets the acceptability standards for non-cost factors will be awarded the Purchase Order. <br />The Government may reject any proposal that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low priced when compared to Government estimates, such that the proposal is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.<br />The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the Purchase Order without discussions with the offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306). However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and request proposal revisions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><br />Factor 1 - Technical</p>
<p>The proposals will be evaluated based on the criteria established in this solicitation as follows.</p>
<p>In order to achieve an Acceptable rating in the Technical factor, the offeror's proposal must clearly meet the following minimum requirements: <br />Technical Approach: The offeror's proposal shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements as defined in the Statement of Work to include:</p>
<p>I. The contractor shall show experience with the design and manufacture of custom high-quality wood/glass furniture by providing examples of recent work with their proposal in the form of pictures/drawings/etc.</p>
<p>ii. Understanding of the relationship between the build requirements and the design intent.</p>
<p>iii. Understanding the Requirements - The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which it demonstrates a clear and complete understanding of all requirements involved including capabilities, knowledge and expertise in the requested services and meeting the requirements presented by the PWS.</p>
<p>iv. Feasibility of Approach - The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the PWS requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. The evaluation will also consider the realism of the allocated hours, labor categories and price being proposed in the offeror's response to the PWS.</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL RATING DEFINITION</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE: Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />UNACCEPTABLE: Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Price<br />1. The Total Evaluated Price will be determined by summing the price proposed on each Line Item. This Total Evaluated Price will then be evaluated for reasonableness in accordance with price analysis techniques at FAR 15.404-1(b). Price will not be given a rating. <br />2. An offeror must propose on all Line Items to be considered for award <br />3. Adequate competition is anticipated for this Purchase Order. However, in the event that only one offer is received, the Government reserves the right to perform a cost analysis IAW FAR 15.404-1(c). Therefore, in instances when only one offer is received the contracting officer may require cost or pricing data, but such cost or pricing data is not required to be certified by the offeror. Cost or Pricing Data or Other than certified cost or pricing data shall be provided upon request IAW FAR 15.403. This information will be evaluated for magnitude and reasonableness and may be adjusted from a technical and cost perspective using cost analysis to determine the most probable cost to the Government. Offerors shall utilize a Microsoft Excel file format with formulas intact when submitting their Price/Cost quote (FAR 15.403-5(b)(1)).<br />4. Price/Cost Inconsistencies: A proposal is presumed to represent an offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. Each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms for award for this Purchase Order. Any inconsistencies in performance or price should be explained in the proposal. Any significant inconsistencies, if unexplained, raise a fundamental issue of the offeror's understanding of the nature and scope of work required and its financial ability to perform the contract, and may be grounds for rejection of the proposal.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Item Description: NSN 2540-01-330-8062- TARPAULIN Panel, bought in accordance with (19207) Basic Drawing NR 10936264. Based on market research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 10 days of this notice. The required quantity is CLIN 0001 2,700 units, CLIN 0002 2,525 units with no option shipping CLIN 0001 to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA and CLIN 0002 to (W62G2T) Tracy, CA. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program. FOB origin and inspection at origin are required. This solicitation will be available on the internet at </span><a href="http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">http://www.dibbs.bsmdla.mil/rfp</span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> after the issue date of 11/1/2017. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. This solicitation is a HubZone set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>past performance. The required delivery is&nbsp;75 days. Surplus is acceptable for this procurement and will be considered. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in English and in US dollars. All interested parties may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access. Vendor is responsible to confirm that each employee held annual RAPIDGate&reg; badge is active for the specific facility and performance period in accordance with RAPIDGate&reg; User Agreement (http://www.RAPIDGate.com). <br /><br />Additional access permissions may be required such as Navy Base Point Loma "Enclave Access request form". <br /><br />Vehicle Access: Required for vehicle access to Navy facilities.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-73, Compliance with the Laws (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:</p>
<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. (End of clause)</p>

<p><br />NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, November 7, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8720 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) issues solicitation<br />N00024-17-R-4428 for the execution of the USS Oscar Austin (DDG 79)<br />FY18 DMP on the East or Gulf Coast. The availability will include a combination of<br />maintenance, modernization, and repair, and is expected to require a highly<br />capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a DDG 51 class capable<br />pier and dry-dock as well as human resources capable of completing,<br />coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and<br />modernization. The delivery date of the vessel is expected to be no later than<br />10 May 2019.
<p>In accordance with the CNO's Homeport Statute, 10 U.S. Code 7299a(c),<br />CNO availabilities with production periods estimated to be greater than 180<br />calendar days are considered long-term and will be competed on a coast-wide<br />basis, without limiting the place of performance to the vessel's homeport. As<br />the production period for the USS Oscar Austin FY18 DMP is greater<br />than 180 calendar days, the availability shall be competed on a East and Gulf coastwide<br />basis. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the<br />requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or<br />more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement and<br />therefore this procurement will not be set-aside for small business (FAR<br />19.502-2(b)).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

"MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

In case any material or workmanship furnished by the contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery of the vessel, or not in accordance with the requirements of the contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its correction or replacement by the contractor at the contractor's cost and expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any Guarantee clause in this contract. If the contractor fails to proceed promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or workmanship and charge to the contractor the excess cost to the Government. The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the contract. Records of all inspection work by the contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the performance of the contract and for a period of two (2) years after delivery of the vessel to the Government.<br />(d) No welding, including tack welding and brazing, shall be permitted in connection with repairs, completions, alterations, or addition to hulls, machinery or components of vessels unless the welder is, at the time, qualified to the standards established by the U.S. Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, or the Department of the Navy. The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the particular service application, filler material type, position of welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken.

Welders' qualifications for this purpose shall be governed by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F). When a welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests shall be conducted in accordance with the United States Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations and Material Specifications (46 CFR Subchapter F).<br />(e) The contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the vessel from fire, and the contractor shall maintain a reasonable system of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters, painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's fuel oil tanks, magazines or storerooms containing flammable material. A reasonable number of hose lines shall be maintained by the contractor ready for immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed alongside the contractor's pier or in dry dock or on a marine railway.

Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being performed thereon.<br />(f) The contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such safety precautions as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.<br />(g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel is in the custody of the contractor or in dry dock or on a marine railway and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or other proper means, as approved by the COR.<br />(h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel attached to the vessel. The contractor shall ensure that assigned personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that such personnel will not interfere with the work or the contractor's workers.<br />(i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the dimensions, sizes, and shapes shown in any sketches, drawings, plans or specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. Prior to submitting an offer, it is the responsibility of the bidder/offeror to verify the dimensions, sizes, and shapes in materials provided by the Government. Where practical, the Government will make the vessel available for inspection prior to bid opening or the date for receipt of proposals. If the contractor, as a result of inspection or otherwise, discovers any error in the sketches, drawings, plans or specifications, it shall immediately inform the Contracting Officer of the error and proceed in accord with instructions received from the Contracting Officer.

<p>1352.271-87 - Changes-Ship Repair (APR 2010)<br />(a) The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order, and without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general scope of this contract, in any one or more of the following:<br />(1) Drawings, designs, or specifications, when the supplies to be furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications;<br />(2) Method of shipment or packing;<br />(3) Place of performance of the work;<br />(4) Time of commencement or completion of the work; and<br />(5) Other requirements within the general scope of the contract.<br />(b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether changed or not changed by the order, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract accordingly.<br />(c) The contractor must submit any proposal for adjustment under this clause within 5 days from the date of receipt of the written order. At the Contracting Officer's discretion, the 5-day period may be shortened.

However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.

This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00.<br />(2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of clause 1352.271-79. This insurance shall be for $1,000,000.00 on account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings are not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1700 hrs PST, November 7, 2017.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov  for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<CONTACT>Gosnell, Jody
<DESC>This is a Request for Quote (RFQ). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Headquarters Procurement Operations Division (HPOD), has a requirement for Environmental Consulting Services for the EPAs Office of Policy (OP). The EPA is requesting quotes in accordance with the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.002(b). This requirement is a set-aside for small business. 

The EPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM), Program Contract Service Center (PCSC), located at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20460 intends to award a Firm-Fixed Priced (FFP) purchase order contract from the successful vendors quote under NAICS Code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services. The EPA intends to award a one (1) year purchase order contract for required services in support of the EPA OP requirement entitled, Building Regional Disaster Resilience in California. Vendor quotes must address all aspects of the EPA's requirements set forth in the attached Statement of Work (SOW). Quotes are limited to 30 pages in length, inclusive of all documents - 27 pages for technical volume AND  three (3) pages for price quote. Any document in excess of the 30- page limitation will not be evaluated. Vendors must submit the technical volume and the price quote as two (2) separate documents. Questions concerning this RFQ must be submitted by 10:00 AM ET Tuesday, October 10, 2017. Questions submitted after this due date may not be answered. QUOTES FOR THIS RFQ MUST BE SUBMITTED THROUGH FEDCONNECT BY 2:00 PM ET FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 2017. Quotes submitted after the RFQ response date or outside of FEDCONNECT will not be accepted. 
Prospective sources are reminded that an award can only be made to a vendor with current registration in the System of Award Management (SAM) database at www.sam.gov in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.11 and may not be listed in the Excluded Parties List System at www.epis.gov. 
The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, price or other factors considered. For this solicitation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are more important than cost or price. Additionally, the Government reserves the right to consider the realism of the offerors proposed price(s), if necessary, as a method of determining if price reveals problems that would impact performance risk and responsibility matters. Cost/Price realism analysis will be performed, if necessary, in accordance with the methodology set forth in FAR 15.404-1(d). Evaluation factors for award can be found in the attachment section of this RFQ. 

PRICE QUOTE: 
Offerors shall submit a fixed labor rate price quote in response to the RFQ. The price quote shall demonstrate the proposed/estimated level of effort and mix of labor necessary to perform this requirement. EPA has estimated that approximately 948 hours of direct labor will be required to complete these services.  These estimates are for informational purposes only and while it may be used to compute the vendors total price quote, it is not required to be used as the basis for vendor quotes.  The price quote shall include all applicable labor categories, the estimated number of labor hours per labor category, applicable labor rates, other direct costs (if applicable), and the total estimated price/cost. Also note that tax should not be included in the price since the federal government is exempt from paying taxes. The tax exempt number is 52-085-2695. 

TECHNICAL VOLUME: 
The technical volume must be sufficiently detailed to enable the EPA to make a thorough evaluation and to arrive at a sound determination as to whether the proposed services meet the requirements of the SOW and the offered approach is valid and practical. The technical volume must be specific, detailed and complete to clearly demonstrate how the offeror plans to execute the requirements described in the SOW, including a timeline and details for tasks and deliverables. Clear evidence of services and/or processes previously demonstrated and currently in place relating to the technical evaluation criteria should be included as well. 

For this requirement, the technical evaluation factors for award are as follows: 

Technical Approach and Capability: 
The contractor shall demonstrate its ability to meet all of the REQUIREMENTS listed in the SOW. 

Past Performance: 
The contractor shall demonstrate that is has successfully performed transcription services for similar requirements with respect to task size, scope, and complexity. The contractor shall submit at least two (2) examples of relevant past performance performed within the past three (3) years that includes a description of the work performed and contact information (e.g., name, telephone number and email address) for past performance references. 

The technical evaluation factors listed above are of relative, equal importance.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">AFTER simultaneously e-mailing your proposal to <a href="mailto:james.mowery@dot.gov">james.mowery@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:hank.clyatt@dot.gov">hank.clyatt@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:david.stackleather@dot.gov">david.stackleather@dot.gov</a> and to <a href="mailto:ellen.polsky@dot.gov">ellen.polsky@dot.gov</a> by the deadline specified in this RFQ, please send, to ALL of those SAME addressees, a SEPARATE follow-up e-mail:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) which does NOT have your proposal attached to it; and (b) which merely confirms the precise time at which you had sent your PRECEDING e-mail that DID have your proposal to attached to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And also please FORWARD, to all of those same DOT addressees, your PREVIOUSLY-sent e-mail that DID have your proposal attached to it, but with the proposal-attachment DELETED from that forwarding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, if and ONLY if, by 1:00 P Eastern Time on November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2017, you have not received, from ANY of the DOT addressees specified above, an e-mailed CONFIRMATION that your e-mailed PROPOSAL has been RECEIVED by DOT, then please:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) FAX your entire proposal to 202-366-7510 and to 202-366-9848; and (b) call Mr. Hank Clyatt at 202-366-8020 or Ms. Ellen Polsky at 202-493-0390, and obtain, from one of those persons, a DOT Security Office fax number, and then ALSO fax your entire proposal to that Security fax number; and (c) ship one original and 8 complete hard-paper copies of your entire proposal, via a dependable parcel-shipment-and-delivery-service, to Mr. James Mowery at: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>U.

<p>The precautionary procedures described above are NOT intended as any extension or relaxation of the proposal-submission-deadline specified in the RFQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they are an acknowledgement of the fact that DOT's e-mail-security-firewall sometimes BLOCKS incoming e-mails that have an attachment.</p>

Incorporate Question and Answer for Item #2, Dell Hard Drive.  Question: Dell Hard Drive is going EOL.

<p class="MsoNormal">CODE IDENTIFICATION AND PROJECT TITLE: 2017-21007A: Waste Lube Oil (WLO) Collection and Re-refining Project Feasibility Study</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study ("Study") in support of a waste lube oil ("WLO") collection and re-refining project.  The objective of the Study is to evaluate the establishment of an integrated chain of operations for gathering WLO, re-refining and marketing the base oils.  This includes determining the best technology solutions; substantiating the economic, technical, environmental, commercial and financial viability of the project; assessing the regulatory framework and making recommendations for possible changes that could increase the efficiency of the market; and evaluating different collection mediums and sources for collecting, storing and transporting WLO from sources to the re-refining facility(ies).</p>
<p>PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>The U.S. Trade and Development Agency ("USTDA") is providing a grant to ElSewedy Electric S.A.E. (the "Grantee") for a feasibility study (the "Study") that will assist the Grantee in evaluating the technical, regulatory and financial viability of a proposed waste lube oil ("WLO") collection and re-refining project ("Project") in Egypt ("Host Country").</p>
<p>Currently, Egypt consumes approximately 650,000 metric tons ("MT") of lubricants per year.  However, it is estimated that only a small percentage is collected and re-refined.  The objective of the Study is to evaluate the establishment of an integrated chain of operations for gathering WLO, re-refining and marketing the base oils.  This includes determining the best technology solutions; substantiating the economic and financial viability of the project; assessing the regulatory framework and making recommendations for possible changes that could increase the efficiency of the market; and evaluating different collection mediums and sources for collecting, storing and transporting WLO from sources to the re-refining facility(ies).</p>
<p>One of the critical aspects of the Study will be to assess the amount of available WLO feedstock in order for the Grantee to make an informed decision to commission the construction of the first re-refining facility, which would have a capacity to produce up to +/-30,000 MT of re-refined lubricating oil per year.  Over time, as additional feedstock becomes increasingly available, the Grantee will seek to scale up and expand its operations through the construction of two additional re-refining facilities, which would have a total capacity to produce up to 90,000 MT of re-refined lubricating oil per year. The grantee may also decide to expand its collection infrastructure to be larger than the re-refining capacity of the plants to have an option to sell the excess WLO to other facilitites/companies locally or internationaly.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Cairo, the Grantee, ElSewedy Electric S.A.E. established its operation as a family-owned electrical equipment trading company in 1938.  It expanded its operations over the following decades, primarily in the energy sector.  Since then, Elsewedy has grown to a fully integrated energy solutions provider with operations predominately in North Africa, the Middle East and in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $762,902 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 7.5pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><a href="http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form">http://www.ustda.gov/business-opportunities/request-proposal-form</a></span><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5:00 PM LOCAL TIME (Cairo, Egypt), December 15, 2017</span></strong> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<p>1. Extend the response date for this RFI to 14 December 2017.</p>
<p>2. PM ITTS IMO has further refined the strategy for ILTE and has determined that the effort will be pursued as an order under Modernizing Instrumentation Solutions for Test and Evaluation (MISTE), a forthcoming competitive effort also in support of PM ITTS IMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Original Notice:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request for Information (RFI)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Integrated Live, Virtual, Constructive<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Test Environment (ILTE)<br /></strong><br />1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain information and solicit industry comment in anticipation of a future competitive solicitation for the product development for the ILTE program.<br /><br />2.0 Introduction<br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Instrumentation, Targets, and Threat Simulators and SOF Training Systems (PM ITTS) Instrumentation Management Office (IMO) is performing research to gather information and feedback from interested sources for a new contract supporting the current and future objectives of the Instrumentation Management Office. This support extends to its Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) customers, including - but not limited to - the US Army Operational Test Command (OTC), Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC), the Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC) and the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&amp;E).<br /><br />2.1 Program Description<br />PM ITTS IMO has a requirement to support the OTC's mission to provide congressionally-mandated operational testing of new and emerging systems. As operational testing is conducted at a variety of locations versus a single test site, ILTE must operate in a wide range of environments, from urban to austere. Test events normally last several weeks, with extended periods of operations up to 96 hours.</p>
<p>ILTE will pursue a two-path approach:<br /><br />1) Design, develop and provide an integrated suite of live-synthetic simulations capable of producing operational realism to provide an accurate battlefield test environment, capture, record and transmit all required test data, and provide a data reduction, analysis and visualization capability.</p>
<p>2) Design, develop and provide technical solutions to address gaps in current test/training technologies to support operational tests. Gap technologies may comprise one of two potential solutions: 1) a capability unique to a given test and not transitioned as a part of the objective suite of test tools or 2) a capability the tester may leverage to support a variety of tests and transitions as a part of the objective suite of test tools.</p>
<p>ILTE will enable PM ITTS IMO to employ a block approach to modernize the existing operational test/training technology suite. The block approach utilizes three primary thrust areas: 1) Analysis of Alternatives and Research and Development, 2) Prototyping, development and field testing, and 3) Systems/components integration to support Operational Tests. The blocks are not necessarily sequential in execution but will overlap throughout the period-of-performance.</p>
<p>ILTE is expected to provide PM ITTS IMO&lsquo;s customer base a suite of new capabilities that mitigates obsolescence, meets higher thresholds of technical performance, and improves test/training efficiencies. The spectrum of effort required is expected to range from Science &amp; Technology transition, requirements analysis and concept exploration to technology investigation and rapid prototyping, system development, system sustainment, system storage, system deployment and other related tasks.</p>
<p>The ILTE required functional capability areas respondents should address include:</p>
<p>1) Real Time Casualty Assessment (RTCA) Effects: Includes the simulation, execution, and analysis of engagements that produce realistic outcomes based on the lethality and survivability characteristics between hostile, friendly, and ancillary forces within the operational environment. RTCA includes live and synthetic player units, their health and status, their position location information, and their interactions with other player units and the physical environment.</p>
<p>2) Integrating Architectures and Standards: Includes integrating architectures and standards common to test and training environments, common data models, and current and evolving architectures, protocols, and standards.</p>
<p>3) Synthetic Environments: Includes computer-based representations of the real world, including the natural environment and allows for the interaction among and between combinations of Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) player units. The synthetic environments may be created within a single computer or over a distributed network connected by local and wide area networks and augmented by realistic special effects and accurate behavioral models to provide visualization of and immersion into the environment being simulated.</p>
<p>4) Test Planning: Includes capabilities that optimize test trials and resource allocation in support of verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) and operational testing.</p>
<p>5) Test Monitoring and Control: Includes test monitoring and control requirements that allow test team personnel to monitor and control the processes, systems, and player units in an operational test; especially technologies that ensure test factors are met and required data collected. In addition, this section covers requirements associated with alerts and automated reports to indicate test vignette and data collection status.</p>
<p>6) Cybersecurity: Includes design, implementation, and approval with DOD directives and Army regulations pertaining to cybersecurity, including Certificate of Networthiness, Authority to Operate, and Cross Domain Solutions (CDS).</p>
<p>7) Networks: Includes requirements for networks associated with supporting the transfer of data between required locations for the following activities: health and status monitoring, force-on-target networks (e.g.) pop-ups, buildings, etc.), situational awareness of test environment, and the force-on-force engagement interactions required between live and synthetic player units/ environments to produce the required RTCA effects.</p>
<p>8) Data Collection, Reduction, Analysis, and Visualization: Includes requirements associated with data collection, reduction, analysis, and visualization. This includes access, analysis, and visualization of collected test data.</p>
<p>9) Live Environment Compatibility and Risk Reduction: Includes the capabilities required to address live environment compatibility, risk reduction, and incorporation of lessons learned to enable effective application and enhancement of solutions in support of operational tests.</p>
<p>10) Test as a Service (TaaS): Includes the requirements to provide full support of on-site operational testing. Anticipated functions include test planning, integration of live-virtual-constructive technologies, design and development of hardware and software prototypes, production and development of test technologies, deployment of instrumentation to support on-site operational testing and provide logistical and maintenance support.</p>

<DESC><p>Market Survey for the procurement of 5 Axis Milling Machines</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute. Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.</p>

The contract periods for the service will consist of a base year and four option years with an additional 6 month optional period. The Contractor will normally conduct these services on-site 6-12 times per year; approximately every other month or once per month, based on institution need.

Amendment No. 2

The FAA anticipates issuing multiple amendments to the FFSP draft SIR market survey announcement from February through April. The goal of the amendments will be to ensure open communication with industry and obtain continuous feedback on updates to the draft SIR. The amendments are anticipated to include: FAA clarifications to general comments, additional FAA questions, the publication and updates to the Interested Parties list, updates to the draft SIR, and various other information.

The purpose of this Amendment is to: 

1.)	Provide the following FAA clarifications.

a.	The FAA Market Survey announcement stated that the OASIS II (automation platform only) requirement would be incorporated in the scope of the FFSP SIR. To clarify, in the event it is determined that procurement under this contract is in the FAAs best interest, contract requirements will be developed and a proposal will be negotiated prior to the work being ordered under the contract. 

b.	The PWS, Section C.1.3 states that If required, the Service Provider must provide: Automated delivery and notifications of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). To clarify, in the event it is determined that procurement of this service under the FFSP contract is in the FAAs best interest, contract requirements will be developed and a proposal will be negotiated prior to the work being ordered under the contract.

2.)	Post the following additional questions for industry feedback.

a.	It is the FAAs current assumption that pre-Full Operating Capability transition costs will be captured in CLINs X001 and that operating costs and post-Full Operating Capabilities costs will be captured in CLINs X002, X003, and X004.  Based on your planned transition strategy, when do you anticipate the FAA would begin payment for operating costs (CLINs X002, X003, X004) for the period between Initial Operating Capacity (IOC) and Full Operating Capacity (FOC)?  Please provide a rough estimate of those costs per year from 2018-2020.

b.	To meet the objective of reducing staffing and associated costs, Draft Section J-9 included Acceptable Performance Level (APL) metrics related to Occupancy and Availability percentages.  The FAA has considered establishing an APL that would measure the percentage of calls answered within a certain number of seconds. Please provide recommendations for metrics for the FAA to consider that would satisfy our objectives of reducing staffing and associated costs. Please explain how those metrics will meet these objectives.

3.)	Publish the current Interested Parties List.

Below is the current Interested Parties List of companies that have expressed an interest in the procurement and have requested that their Point of Contract information be made public:

b.	The FAA is considering an adjustment to the Period of Performance to reflect a 5-Year Base Period followed by five 2-Year Option Periods.

c.	Relative to the Draft SIR Section L.23.4 Volume V- Past Performance, the FAA is considering a change to the requirement. The new draft wording is shown below. Please state whether you have any concerns with this revision.

NEW DRAFT WORDING: Using Attachment J.X, the Offeror shall cite and describe at least three (3) contracts (Government or non-Government) that ended no later than 5 years prior to the date of Final SIR release, with an annual value of $10,000,000 or more, for a system/enterprise of similar size and complexity to FFSP.

I.	PURPOSE

This Market Survey/RFI is a continuation in a series of announcements regarding the Future Flight Services Program (FFSP).  Since 2011, the FAA has released the following announcements related to the FFSP:  

1.	Market Survey 11279 - Industry Survey for Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) - November 2011
2.	Market Survey 11872 - Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) - June 2012
3.	Market Survey 12393 - Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) Market Research - FAA/Industry Communication - October 2012
4.	Market Survey 14575 - Flight Service Direct (FSD) - July 2013
5.	Market Survey 23394  Future Flight Service Program (FFSP) Market Survey/Request for Information  January 2016

The purpose of this Market Survey/RFI is to:

	Assess market interest and capabilities to satisfy the requirements for the FFSP
	Solicit industry feedback on the FFSP Draft SIR and FAA questions

II.	CURRENT DELIVERY OF FLIGHT SERVICES

Currently, FAA flight services throughout the United States are delivered by a combination of the systems and contract vehicles identified below. All the contracts provide services in accordance with FAA Order JO 7110.10 Flight Services.

1.	The Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) contract (DTFAWA-05-C-00031), with Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides the full range of flight services to users in the CONUS, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  The contract provides certified Flight Service Specialists who deliver preflight, inflight and flight data services to users via telephone and radios.  Lockheed Martin provides personnel, equipment and facilities for flight services under the AFSS contract.  The FAA provides Lockheed Martin with access to and use of its air-to-ground radio and telecommunications infrastructure to facilitate inflight communications. 

2.	The Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) II contracts (DTFAWA-15-C-00035 and DTFAWA-15-C-00036), with CSC Government Solutions (CSC) and Lockheed Martin Corporation, provides users with internet-based preflight services (self-briefings and flight plan filing) without the aid of flight service specialists.   

3.	The Operational and Supportability Implementation System (OASIS) II contract (DTFAWA-15-C-00006), with Harris Corporation, provides an automation system for the Alaska flight service facilities that enables FAA flight service specialists to provide weather briefing and flight planning assistance to general aviation pilots, as well as, emergency services, law enforcement support, regulatory information and other services. 
 
III.	FFSP OBJECTIVES AND PLANNED ACQUISITION STRATEGY

FFSP Objectives
The FAAs Future Flight Services Program (FFSP) vision is to transform and modernize the delivery of flight services. The FAA believes that costs can be reduced by focusing on changing user behavior and migrating to automated, self-assisted service delivery models, while still maintaining quality of service and safety.  

Through FFSP, the FAA seeks to create a long-term contract vehicle and establish relationships with the Service Provider, industry and user groups to better position the agency to take advantage of user behavior changes and improved technology. 
Together, government and industry will work to realize three strategic goals:
1.	Reduce the FAA cost to provide Flight Service, with a target reduction over 65%.
2.	Encourage the use of technology, industry best practices, and authoritative flight data accessed through SWIM to improve efficiency and quality of service delivery.
3.	Facilitate and gain stakeholder acceptance of changes in Flight Service delivery.

  Planned Acquisition Strategy

The FAA intends to conduct a competition and award a single contract.  The FFSP contract will replace the existing AFSS and DUATS II contracts. The FAA Draft SIR is structured to allow maximum flexibility to adapt to changing conditions to meet user needs.    The FFSP Draft SIR will:

	Require the Service Provider to provide all facilities, equipment, and personnel to perform preflight, in-flight, and flight data services. 
	Utilize a contract structure(s) that allows for the modification and/or phased elimination of services with associated cost adjustments over the life of the contract.  
	Utilize a contract structure(s) to incentivize continuous improvement, the integration of new technologies, service optimization, and cost savings/sharing opportunities. 
	Allow for commercial revenue opportunities (e.g., advertising) if there are cost savings benefits to the Government. 

Although, the FAA anticipates the OASIS II (automation platform only) requirement to be incorporated in the scope of the FFSP SIR, the FAA does not intend to replace OASIS at contract award.


IV.	INDUSTRY FEEDBACK 

The FAA requests Industry comments on the FFSP Draft SIR. The FAA also requests Industry response to the questions below.  

1.	The FAA seeks feedback on the CLIN Structure and Type and Incentive/Award fee provisions. Please discuss whether the Draft SIR will allow the FAA to achieve the stated objectives and the vendor to implement its business model.  Do the Incentive/Award fee provisions reward innovation and drive increased use of technology? Please provide any recommended changes to the CLIN Structure, CLIN Type, or Incentive /Award fee provisions, along with the reasoning behind the recommendations.  
2.	The FAA recognizes user behavioral change is uncertain, however significant change has occurred over the last ten (10) years which is expected to continue.  Please provide any recommended changes to the SIR that will allow the FAA and the Service Provider to realize benefit from additional behavior change and/or improvements in technology.
3.	Please discuss any concerns you have relative to the affordability profile presented in Section L.17. Please discuss, conceptually, suggestions of how a pay down schedule of non-recurring costs could be structured.
4.	Please discuss if and when a 65% reduction in FAA Operation Cost is achievable.  If the governments affordability profile were increased, would the increase impact your ability to achieve the FAAs cost reduction objectives?  Please explain.
5.	Please identify any requirements in the Draft SIR that you believe may drive a higher cost or a delay to transition. Please provide your suggestions for alternate requirements.  
6.	Are the transition requirements and the transition constraints sufficient for you to develop the transition plan?
7.	Please provide any suggestions for the test program requirements including the appropriate level of rigor for this service while not creating delay and/or excessive cost.
8.	Do the FAA Security requirements constrain your solution or hinder the ability to achieve the stated FAA cost reduction objectives?  Please discuss the specific security controls that will constrain your solution.  Please discuss any specific recommendations you have to address the stated concerns.
9.	Do you recommend changes to or additional Acceptable Performance Levels (APL)? Will the APLs ensure performance is met?  Do the APLs affect your ability to innovate or the ability to meet the FAAs stated objectives?  Based on your experience with call centers, what are your recommended APLs on measurements such as utilization and occupancy?  Are there other APLs that should be considered?
10.	Please provide recommendations for specifying service availability.  Please provide any recommendations for specifying operational contingency.
11.	Please provide any recommendations for additional flexibility in the contract structure.  
12.	The FAA is considering implementation of a Centralized Flight Planning service. Please discuss any impacts of this service to your proposed solution and/or business model.
13.	Please provide any specific orders, policy and/or guidance changes that you recommend the FAA consider and describe how the change to the order, policy and/or guidance will impact your proposed solution and the FAAs FFSP acquisition objectives.  
14.	 The FAA has provided additional transactional data in the Draft SIR.  Does the transactional data provided in the Draft SIR provide enough information for you to develop your solution and proposal?
15.	What would be the impact to your solution and cost proposal if the FAA were to require additional workload data such as time spent on discrete transactions (e.g. flight plans, standard briefings, etc. per call), and pilot metrics.
16.	The Service Contract Act (SCA) will apply to the FFSP acquisition.  SCA wage rates for Flight Service Specialist (FSS) were reviewed on numerous occasions by the Department of Labor (DOL) and in a May 21, 2007 Decision, the DOL concluded that issuance of a specialized SCA wage determination to cover the FSS working on the current AFSS contract was appropriate. 

The job category currently listed in the Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations, 29000 Technical Occupations, 29011 Air Traffic Control Specialist  Station, is the minimum wage established by the DOL: 

Wage and Hour Division (WHD)
Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations

<p><br /><strong>A. Purpose</strong><br />The Federal Student Aid (FSA) is requesting information on potential service providers to develop, operate, and maintain a next-generation version of the Department of Education's user provisioning application, the Participation Management system (PM).</p>
<p>Note: Please refer to the attached Current State and High Level Requirements documents, which provide additional system description information.</p>
<p>The Department is seeking industry's input on both development time and high level cost associated with two potential development paths to meet the business needs identified below:</p>
<p>1. A completely new system using the best-available industry standard technologies;<br />2. A Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product, customized by the vendor</p>
<p><strong>B. Background: <br /></strong>Participation Management (PM) is Federal Student Aid's (FSA) central system for managing enrollment in and access to FSA's electronic data exchange services. These electronic services include both batch download and online data exchange services used by FSA partner organizations in carrying out their administrative duties related to the delivery of financial aid to millions of college students. In addition to developing, operating, and maintaining the PM system itself, the PM contractor provides customer support services for mailroom receipt, data processing, and (when necessary) scanning of applications and their supporting documents required for the services enrollment process. The contractor also provides customer support for user enrollment problems.</p>
<p>The PM system interfaces closely with the systems that provide FSA's various data services and with the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) in order to provide those systems with data about who is enrolled in each electronic data service. An additional interface with FSA's Access and Identity Management System (AIMS) provides AIMS with necessary enrollment information for services that require users to authenticate when logging in over the web. PM currently manages over 21,000 new enrollments and 38,000 enrollment updates to these FSA data services annually.</p>
<p>At a high level, FSA's business needs for this system include the following:<br /><br />1. The system shall provide a public-facing interface for the capture and storage of user "access rights" requests.<br /><br />2. The system shall capture and store all imaged signature (approval) documents related to each "access rights" request.<br /><br />3. The system shall provide workflow capabilities to move "access rights" requests through various stages of approval, and from one approver to another, across multiple organizations (example: schools, third party servicing companies, and Federal Student Aid).<br /><br />4. The system shall maintain a hierarchical system of approval, where a limited number of individuals within each organization possess a "Primary Administrator" role, and are responsible for approving (and regularly re-certifying) organizational staff requests for access to FSA systems. <br /><br />5. The system shall capture and store results of all "access rights" applications.<br /><br />6. The system shall be capable of generating and assigning unique "mailboxes" (a unique address identifier) for users and organizations to be used with FSA's Student Access Internet Gateway (SAIG) system. <br /><br />7. The system shall interface with other FSA business systems to provide real-time user "access rights" data to those systems as part of the web login process.<br /><br />8. The system shall also interface with FSA's Access and Identity Management system to authenticate user logins to FSA business systems.<br /><br />9. The system shall generate periodic email notices to all key approvers ("Primary Administrators") to re-certify that the individuals they're responsible for at their institutions are still with the organization and still require access. <br /><br />10. The system shall provide key approvers with the ability to electronically (and annually) re-certify each user under their purview for each electronic service that user should have access to.<br /><br />11. The system shall provide FSA and contractor staff the capability to query its database and provide reports using any of the data elements stored within the database. <br /><br />12. The system shall provide the capability to view, create new, modify services associated with, or delete "mailboxes" (essentially, secure electronic mailboxes that can send files to/receive files from FSA systems). <br /><br />13. The system shall provide the capability to view, add new, or change an existing user's access rights.<br /><br />14. The system shall include a Customer Service Website, used by support staff to conduct research and troubleshoot user problems.<br /><br />15. The system shall provide a method for users to apply for access that shields Personally Identifiable Information (like SSN, mother's maiden name, etc.) from mid-level approvers.<br /><br />16. The system shall be designed in such a way that it is easily (and cheaply) scaled up/down whenever new electronic services, organization types, or user types are added to or deleted from the list of items managed by the application. <br /><br />17. The system shall interface with FSA's Post-Secondary Education Participant System or Integrated Partner Management system to receive and process School File data.<br /><br />18. The system shall be able to store, display, and export official "acknowledgement" documents and agreements which applicants shall read and agree to.<br /><br />19. The system shall be able to capture and store "e-signatures" from approvers of access rights requests throughout multiple stages of approval process.</p>
<p><br /><strong>C. Submission Process</strong><br />This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our planning and market research process for continuing operations, support and maintenance of the FSA PM system.</p>
<p>Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed ten (10) pages in no less than 12 font size.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit questions regarding this&nbsp;RFI via email no later than <strong>October 31, 2017 by 12:00pm EST</strong> to the points of contact listed below. Questions received after this time may not be answered.</p>
<p>Responses shall be emailed no later than <strong>November 7, 2017 by 12:00pm EST</strong>to the points of contact listed below. The preferred media is electronic files in Microsoft Word, Power Point, Excel or PDF (or similar).</p>

Results of Sources Sought

A sources sought was used to conduct market research to determine if qualified small businesses were interested in performing this project.
  The sources sought notice was issued using solicitation number N4425517MKTG1, which was posted on August 24, 2016 with a due date of September 13, 2016.  Only two contractors responded.  Additional outreach was completed including directly contacting small business contractors registered under the appropriate NAICS, resulting in only 2 additional responses.  After a review of all four responses, the Government determined that none of the respondents demonstrated experience in one of the two critical experience elements required by the sources sought.  Based on the market research, it was determined that this procurement will be solicited utilizing full and open competition.  The Small Business Administration concurred with this decision.

<DESC><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />Senate Shredder Systems<br />RFQ-2018-008<br />November 1, 2017<br /><br />Question 1: </strong>Will there be a bulk order up front, or just individual orders placed against the BPA by individual offices throughout the year?<br /><strong>Answer 1:</strong> Individual orders will be placed against the BPA by individual offices throughout the year. There may also be additional purchase orders submitted that are not against the BPA. These will also be placed by individual offices throughout the year.
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Will you only award one contract? Or will you split the award if advantageous?<br /><strong>Answer 2:</strong> We would split the award if advantageous.</p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Shipments to Alaska and Hawaii are far more expensive. Can this additional cost be quoted and added when necessary?<br /><strong>Answer 3:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> What kind of delivery service do you expect for these offices? Can we quote a standard loading dock delivery and then list specific fees for additional services like Inside Delivery, Lift-Gate Service or White Glove Service (unpacking and waste removal)?<br /><strong>Answer 4:</strong> Shredders ordered for offices in DC shall include inside delivery to SAA Shipping and Receiving if the shredders weigh less than 100 lbs.

Inside Delivery and Lift-gate service may be quoted as an additional service.</p>

<p><strong>Question 6:</strong> Will every State office require a new shredder?<br /><strong>Answer 6:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Question 7:</strong> Is there an estimate of quantity in Washington DC area?<br /><strong>Answer 7:</strong> Orders are roughly equally split between DC and state offices.</p>
<p><strong>Question 8:</strong> Should we quote supplies as a separate line for each individual shredder?<strong>Answer 8:</strong> You should indicate what supplies, if any, are included in purchase price. All other supplies should be listed as a separate line for each shredder.</p>
<p><strong>Question 9:</strong> Should an Extended Warranty be offered in addition to standard factory warranty to cover parts and labor?<br /><strong>Answer 9:</strong> No.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS (USACE), INSTITUTE FOR WATER RESOURCES (IWR) IN ALEXANDRIA, VA.
<p>This announcement is made by the US Army Corps of Engineer's Humphreys' Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA), the IWR's cognizant Contracting Office, and is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the Government's needs with regard to the planned execution of a Navigation Data and Systems Analytical and Professional Support Services contract. It is anticipated that this effort will result in the award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple-Award Task Order (MATOC) contract with a Base Year plus four (4) Option Years. The estimated price ceiling for this requirement is approximately $48M.</p>
<p>The Institute for Water Resources (IWR) was formed 47 years ago to provide the USACE Civil Works Program with the capability to analyze and anticipate emerging Navigation trends and issues facing our nation. From its beginnings, one of the core missions of IWR has been to support the Corps Navigation program, including both deep and shallow draft coastal and inland systems in the United States and worldwide. Navigation is the largest Corps Business Line, in terms of value, representing about 45 percent of the Corps Civil Works budget. IWR has been tackling the Navigation data and systems challenges coming from an ever increasing demand for products and services transported by water. As such, there remains a compelling need for analytical and professional support to pursue innovative approaches to solving these new problems. IWR is a Field Operating Activity (FOA) under the supervision and direction of the Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations (DCG-CEO) and Director of Civil Works (DCW) for USACE. IWR's challenging mission remains integral to shaping the evolution of Federal Navigation policy as decision-makers at all levels within USACE look to IWR for insights into a host of complex physical, economic, environmental and social issues.</p>
<p>HECSA is seeking information on companies that have the capability to provide technical and analytical support services for the Institute for Water Resources that is generally not available within the USACE. The scope of this effort is intended to encompass all aspects of the Civil Works Navigation mission area and other mission areas that connect with Navigation (including Flood Risk Management, Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration, Hydropower, Regulatory, Recreation, and Water Supply, etc.) as well as support to this USACE mission.</p>
<p>The primary contractor support services required are in the following performance area requirements (functional areas):</p>
<p>1. Navigation Studies and Assessments (PWS Part 3.1)<br />2. Navigation Decision Support Systems and Tools (PWS Part 3.2)<br />3. Navigation Data, Collection and Analytical Methodologies, Tools, and Models (PWS Part 3.3)<br />4. Navigation Outreach, and Training Services (PWS Part 3.4)<br />5. Decision Support, Analyses, and Assessments (PWS Part 3.5)<br />6. Future Directions Assessments (PWS Part 3.6)</p>
<p>The level of support required varies by each task order, however, in many cases future task orders will require an integration of expertise from a wide variety of these functional areas.</p>
<p>USACE is requesting two (2) specific areas of information be supplied by interested vendors:</p>
<p>1. Comments and Suggestions for the Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) which has been uploaded as Attachment # 1.</p>
<p>2. Capability Statements in response to this RFI, which should include as a minimum the following:</p>
<p>a) A description of the capabilities that demonstrate the interested firm's ability to support the multiple functional areas listed above, [limit 3 pages]</p>
<p>b) A description of company history with regard to (a) how multidisciplinary experience was obtained or developed and (b) types and/or combination of types of awarded contract vehicles (e.g. Cost Reimbursement, IDIQ, Fixed Price, Fixed Price Level of Effort, Time &amp; Materials, etc.). Please submit contract numbers for any completed/in-progress contract of similar work.[limit 10 pages];</p>
<p>c) A description of the degree of teaming needed to meet the requirements listed above, including an estimated percentage of subcontracted partners[limit 1 page];</p>
<p>d) Brief discussion of Key Personnel and their experience with the functional areas.</p>
<p>e) Identify whether you are a small or large business with regard to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541618.</p>
<p><br />This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a solicitation, is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and will not be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the capability statements received. No solicitation exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted at the FedBizOpps website. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any synopsis or solicitation that may result from this market research. Information collected through this announcement will be reviewed by individuals from the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>

<AWARDEE>First Line Technology, LLC, 3656 Centerview Drive, Suite 4, Chantilly, VA 20151 US
<DESC>1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: <br />The Office of Acquisition Management proposes to enter into a delivery order on a limited sources basis for Decontamination Kits on behalf of Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Weapons of Mass Destruction Countermeasures Division (DS/C/PSP/WMD). <br /><br />2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.<br />The action being approved is restricting consideration of sources in a delivery order acquisition conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 152(3) and 40 U.S.C. 501. Specifically, consideration will be restricted to a single source: First Line Technology, GSA Schedule number GS-07F-5532R. The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price. <br /><br />3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs.<br />The requirement is to provide replacement of expiring decontamination kits that have been distributed to employees worldwide to provide individuals with an immediate, emergency personal decontamination capability in the event of Chemical or Biological or Radiological incident. Speed is of the essence in regard to decontamination of skin from dangerous chemical agents. The WMD countermeasures office is seeking to purchase a quantity of 18,970 kits. This will allow the Office of WMD to accomplish the replacement of the expiring decontamination kits.<br /><br />WMD specifically requires prepackaged personal decontamination kits capable of decontamination of both traditional chemical warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals from skin by employing both adsorptive/absorptive properties and chemical neutralization that does not require additional tools or materials to be operational nor require the use of water. The kit must include two components, the first a dry, non woven fabric wipe to adsorb/absorb chemical materials from the skin, and the second, and an active decontamination component that provides the neutralization action. This active component must be FDA cleared for use on human skin. All components of the decontamination kits must have documented compatibility testing complete and the vendor must make this testing available to the DOS.
<p>All components that comprise each kit must be vacuum packed into a clear re-sealable pouch. Each kit must feature external labeling that at a minimum includes the date of manufacture and a manufacturers lot number for each item inside. The kits must have a shelf life of at least 5 years from date of manufacture. The vendor's facility must be FDA registered for kitting of medical devices and the vendor must provide FDA registration number.</p>
Each Kit will be composed of the following items:<br /><br />&bull; Qty 1: RSD-F5402 - Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion - RSDL; Individual Single Use Packet, 42ml<br />&bull; Qty 1: FBT-PAD-6X12 - Fibertect 6 x 12 Pad/Wipe <br />&bull; Qty 1: FBT-PAD-6X12 - Fibertect 6 x 12 Pad/Wipe
<p>Packaging marked with the following:<br />&bull; Manufacture Date of each item kit<br />&bull; Lot Number of each item<br />&bull; Lot Number of kit<br />&bull; Expiration date of each item in kit<br />&bull; 5 year shelf life (from manufacture date) on the 42ml RSDL if RSDL is stored at temperatures between 10&deg; C and 30&deg; C.<br />&bull; Serial Number<br />&bull; Kit name and kit number ("Responder Decon Kit" and "RDK-42-612/2")</p>
<p>Packaging Requirements:<br />&bull; Fibertect Items Individually Packaged in MIL-PRF-131K, CL I, Film Foil <br />&bull; Certificate of Compliance for MIL-SPEC <br />&bull; Master Kit Packaging: Clear Reseal-able Pouch, Heat-Sealed<br />&bull; Kit package size: 8" x 10"<br /><br />4. The authority and supporting rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor's unique qualifications to provide the supply or services. This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 152(3), and 40 U.S.C. 501), as implemented by FAR 8.4 and substantiated by the following: FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B) - Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>A formal RFI (Sources Sought 1238539) was posted on General Services Administration (GSA) Opportunities website, which resulted in only one industry reply - from First Line Technology.</p>
<p>The First Line Technology Responder Decon Kit is the only product that meets the Governments unique requirements and First Line Technology is the only distributor of the FiberTect Responder Decon Kit, part number RDK-42-612/2.</p>
<p>The FiberTect Responder Decon Kit is the only product that contains both an adsorptive/absorptive capability and an active chemical neutralization agent within the same kit. The active neutralizing component of the kit meets the department's requirement as it has been cleared by the FDA for the decontamination of skin. Additionally, both of the components of the kit have favorably undergone the necessary compatibility testing with each other and existing DOS personnel protective equipment.</p>
<p>No other product is known that will meet the Department's requirements.</p>
<p>5. A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d) and FAR 8.405-(d). <br />The Contracting Office determines that the anticipated price(s) will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that GSA has already determined the prices of supplies under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing. The contracting officer shall verify that the prices awarded do not exceed the price of the supplies under the underlying schedule contract. By signing the justification the Contracting Officer makes a determination that the price to the Government is expected to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>6. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. A formal RFI (Sources Sought 1238539) was posted on General Services Administration (GSA) Opportunities website, which resulted in one industry reply - from First Line Technology. We will use a 100% small business set-aside because our market research has shown that First Line Technology, a small business, is the manufacturer and sole source for this request. No other product is available that will meet the requirements.</p>
<p>7. Any other facts supporting the use of this justification. None.<br /><br />8. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. <br />DOS will continue to conduct market research and issue publish Sources Sought/Request for Information notices, in an attempt to identify competing sources. Additionally, in the future, should DOS identify decontamination kits that will provide specific improvements that might increase longevity or provide equal capability at a lower cost; a consideration may be made to study the products for potential usage. Within 14 days after placing this order exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the ordering activity shall publish a notice and post this justification as required by FAR 8.405-6(a)(2). <br />&emsp;</p>

<DESC>The unusual and compelling Other than Full and Open competition is required due to the exigency of the disaster and the extreme constraints that are currently in effect during this response phase and the lack of local sources with the ability and resources to meet the extreme current need. Due to the massive amounts of commodities that are required to feed and water the population, it is unmanageable and intolerable to conduct extended air and sea operations to satisfy these requirements. The sea ports are over employed and schedules have caused stoppages and gridlocks of critical materials the island requires to continue operations and work toward regularity. There are several communities that remain without power and water and the estimated time of repair/restoration is extended through months at this time. There are several roads and thoroughfares that have been compromised. This vendor has the capacity to employ off-road, special terrain, and other distribution methods that will reach isolated and extremely difficult locations in the mountainous areas of the island. By contracting with this vendor, response times, distribution and supply chain stability is ensured, and the economic restoration of the island is supported. This contract is unusual and compelling as it meets all the requirements, and it will provide immediate lifesaving and life sustaining commodities for the hurricane survivors. The contractor has shown their ability to provide meals in other austere environments immediately following the previous hurricanes with great success.

<DESC><br />This is a notice of award, and not a request for quotation.&nbsp;A solicitation document&nbsp;will not be posted and quotations will not be requested. This unusual and compelling procurement action, in accordance with FAR 6.302-2, is based on the need to procure this medication for patient use.&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the destruction from Hurricane Maria there is a nationwide shortage of critical IV fluids. In order to address these shortages, the NIH CC Pharmacy department has contacted distributors to identify sources of IV fluids to ensure continuation of patient care services while the normal distribution channels recover.<br />After conducting extensive market research, it was determined that the Compounding Center, Inc. is the one responsible source capable of fulfilling the current need of the NIH CC Pharmacy Department is the Compounding Center, Inc. 33777 N SCOTTSDALE RD, STE 125<br />SCOTTSDALE, AZ, 85266-1570.</p>
<p>There is an unusual and compelling urgency related to obtaining these IV fluids. Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico and produced a significant shortfall of production of Baxter's sodium chloride 0.9% injection bags from its Puerto Rico facility. These products are used to provide fluids and medicines to patients across the U.S. Further shortage of these products could potentially put healthcare at risk. <br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted using policies unique to the acquisition of commercial items prescribed in FAR Part 12 in conjunction with the policies and procedures for the competition requirements in FAR Part 6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this posting. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Comments to this announcement, referencing this posting number, may be submitted to the CC, Office of Purchasing and Contracts electronically to the attention of Lisa Schaupp, Contract Specialist (<a href="mailto:Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov">Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov</a>).&nbsp;</p>
