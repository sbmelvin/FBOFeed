<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Full Spectrum Targeting (FST)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-01</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) is soliciting white papers pertaining to the research, development, prototyping, integration, test and demonstration of innovative technologies, tools and practices to advance the future of the Air Force's targeting capabilities. The synergetic integration of kinetic and non-kinetic targeting across a distributed targeting enterprise will support a unified and continuous approach to analyzing a full spectrum of targets and spheres of influence (Air, Space Cyber and Social-Economic).</p>
<p><strong>Target Development, Analysis, and Assessment is the primary focus area for this BAA</strong></p>
<p>The Joint Targeting Cycle is the process that is used consistently across organizations that perform targeting-related tasks. This process consists of six phases: (1) End State/Commander's Objectives; (2) Target Development &amp; Prioritization; (3) Capabilities Analysis; (4) Commander's Decision and Force Assignment; (5) Mission Planning &amp; Force Execution; and (6) Assessment. The targeting enterprise lacks efficient workflow and data hand-offs, causing lost time, redundancy of effort, and lesser quality products and effects across air, space, &amp; cyberspace. The major processes and products relevant to target intelligence production include: Target Systems Analysis (TSA), <br />Intermediate/Advanced Target Development (I/ATD) (Encompassing imagery preparation, target description and significance, Precise Point Mensuration (PPM), and weaponeering), Collateral Damage Estimation (CDE), Electronic Target Folder (ETF), Target Lists (TL) and Battle Damage Assessment (BDA). Development of portions or all of these intelligence products, specifically TSA, I/ATD, CDE, and BDA, are not automated and required considerable resources (time and labor) to produce. Due to the lengthy, disjointed workflow, lack of an automated production process, and limited analytical tools, these processes and accompanying products are also pre-disposed to high error rates and low production capacity. Additionally, a significant deficiency in the current Joint Targeting Cycle is the absence of non-kinetic data in the targeting products throughout. In order to synergize planning and effects across a multi-domain environment, it's essential for FST to include the full range of Cyber, Space, Directed Energy, Electronic Warfare (EW), and influence operations (e.g. Psychological Operation (PSYOPS)/ Military Information Support Operations (MISO)) data into a universal targeting workflow.</p>
<p>We seek new technologies and tools that automate and track the targeting process and workflows, improve the targeting workflow timeline, increase production capacity, enhance product quality, and incorporate Non-Kinetic data into the workflow and products.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Continuous Targeting Processes</span>: The objective in this area is to research and develop technologies that will automate the targeting workflow processing order to reduce the time and levels of effort required by targeteers to produce targeting products, increase quality and support the globally distributed production of targeting products. Challenges include but not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Manage targeting resources (people, data, networks, applications, tasking) across the global targeting enterprise<br /><br />&bull; Monitor global workflow status scalable from macro steps/phases of the workflow down to individual tasks and to include metrics data to support continuous process improvement<br /><br />&bull; Allow for high priority tasks to supersede lesser tasks in workflow</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Target Data Management</span>: The objective of this topic is to explore, identify, and prototype innovative technologies allowing for improved data (to include Kinetic and Non-Kinetic) collection, availability, access, distribution, and quality. The goal is to help targeteers gather, assimilate, and vet relevant targeting information required to build and disseminate targeting products. Challenges include but not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Global access and distribution of all requisite targeting data/products in formats that are both human and machine readable<br />o Store all relevant targeting data, finished products and raw data and make data available to other users in the workflow process as soon as possible/available<br /><br />&bull; Visualize and produce targeting products amenable for integration into documents or briefings (MS Office, Adobe, etc.)<br /><br />&bull; Automatically search, retrieve, and populate data entry fields in specific targeting products as soon as possible/available<br /><br />&bull; Automatically request and collect pre and post-mission Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor data (Kinetic and Non-Kinetic) relating to specific targeting products as soon as possible/available<br /><br />&bull; Improved linking of the overall campaign strategy to individual targeting tasks</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intelligence Assessment (IA):</span> The objective in this area is to develop new technologies and prototypes that identify, combine, formulate and communicate target-related feedback and intelligence information enabling targeteers, planners and commanders a view of the success of ongoing operations from the tactical to the operational and strategic levels. Challenges include but not limited to:<br /><br />&bull; Cohesive assessments and decision support to measure success or failure to achieve the desired effect against individual targets and to facilitate comprehension of the total damage to entire target sets and systems<br /><br />&bull; Timely determination of the campaign plan success (planned objectives versus actual results) achieved by the overall operation as measured over all friendly action against the adversary<br /><br />&bull; The application of Kinetic and Non-Kinetic weaponeering solutions will require the development of innovative Multi-INT information fusion algorithms to support BDA<br /><br />&bull; Investigate and recommend a Cognitive Workflow Process for the production of BDA products <br /><br />&bull; Automated restrike recommendations based on unsuccessful targeting effects</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror's approach demonstrates overall scientific and technical merit for the development and/or enhancement of the technology; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIEBB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the offeror believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information; a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Offerors that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation. For questions, contact DLIS on-line at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a> or at the DLA Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037-3084, telephone number 1-800-352-3572. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process for the reports.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:<br /><br />Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:<br /><br />Capt.

<p>Description:<br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB) plans to procure on a sole source basis with BD Biosciences, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA 95131-1807 maintenance services for the flow cytometry hardware and software systems.

<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19M.</p>
<p>Period of performance is January 20, 2014 through January 19, 2015</p>
<p>It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this contract.</p>
<p>The EIB Flow Cytometry Facility provides basic research support to members of the EIB as well as to investigators throughout NCI, CCR.  Basic research support is provided using multiple instruments manufactured by BD Biosciences and is provided 5 days per week to approximately 75 users.  Each instrument supports multiple experiments each day, and each instrument is fully utilized.</p>
<p>The experiments performed involve costly reagents, expensive animals, and multiple man-hours.  When an instrument malfunctions, or does not operate optimally, these costly experiments are lost.  Some experiments, if unable to be run on the instrument as scheduled, cannot be rescued.  It is critical that this instrument remain in excellent operating condition at all times.   It is also important that the quality of the results from this instrument be kept at a consistently high level.  It is therefore necessary that all instrumentation operate in an optimal fashion, and that down time due to malfunctions and repair time be minimized.   Because the nature of the equipment is highly experimental, the original equipment manufacturer, BD Biosciences, routinely designs and implements software and hardware improvements to the instrumentation.  It is essential to the EIB that these revisions be installed in a timely fashion to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p>It is important that the instrument be kept current with software upgrades and product corrective actions.  NCI also depends heavily on qualified telephone troubleshooting and technical assistance from the manufacturer's staff, including BD Biosciences field engineers already on site at the NIH Bethesda campus who respond quickly.  These assets are available only from BD Biosciences. Some of the instruments are uniquely designed for the laboratory; therefore the manufacturer is the only vendor familiar with service requirements of those instruments.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, especially small businesses, they may submit a tailored statement of capabilities via fax or email.  In addition, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the NCI.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  All information must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 4:00 PM EST on December 18, 2013.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (240) 276-5401 or emailed to Anh-Huy Nguyen, Contracts Specialist at anh-huy.nguyen@nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Please reference solicitation number N02RC46003-71 on all correspondences.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a contract to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center for NIDA Intramural Research Program (IRP) Clinical Research Program support without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).
<p><br /><strong>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541990 with a Size Standard of $14 Million.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05- 70 dated September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><br />The mission of the Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the NIDA is to conduct state-of-the-art research on basic mechanisms that underlie drug abuse and addiction, and to develop new methods for the treatment of drug abuse and addiction. Research is supported at the molecular, genetic, cellular, animal, and clinical levels and is conceptually integrated, highly innovative, and focused on major problems in the field. The long-term goal of the research is to better understand the biological and behavioral factors contributing to initiation, maintenance, and elimination of drug abuse and addiction (and associated diseases), and to translate this knowledge into improved strategies for preventing, treating, and reducing the negative consequences for the individual and for society caused by drug abuse and addiction.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The NIDA requires continued assistance in the ongoing operations of its clinical care support services and provision of resources necessary to maintain the research operation of the NIDA IRP Clinical Research Program.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance<br /></strong>The anticipated period of performance is December 13, 2013 through May 12, 2014. A cost reimbursement contract is contemplated. <br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>The requirement consists of continued Clinical Research Program support services and resources necessary to maintain the research program as follows:</p>
<p>1. Infrastructure<br />2. Medical Consultation<br />3. Diagnostic Laboratory and Other Testing Services<br />4. Nursing Services<br />5. Domiciliary Oversight and Care<br />6. Research Administration<br />7. Transportation and Supplies<br />8. Pharmacy Support</p>
<p><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, this is a follow-on requirement and the intended contract award will serve to continue current services while the Clinical Research Program Support requirement is re-competed. There are no other vendors in the current marketplace who can provide the level of support presently being performed by the incumbent contractor in this interim period. The incumbent contractor, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, has been providing these services since 2008. The required support is mission critical and must not lapse during the clinical research program support re-competition. It is anticipated that the new competition will be conducted on a full and open competitive basis. An award is anticipated prior to May 12, 2014.</p>
<p>The intended source is:</p>
<p>Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center<br />4940 Eastern Avenue<br />Baltimore, MD 21224-2780</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Cincinnati because of its unique ability to study the fate and transport of nanoparticles in aquatic and soil systems.  The research focuses on comparing nanoparticles that occur naturally with engineered ones based on their mobility in soil systems, aggregation and dissolution to increase the understanding on the fate of nanoparticles.  Mobility of nanoparticles could affect the effectiveness of water treatment technology such as filtration and physical interactions between the particles themselves and the environment.
The University of Cincinnati?s (UC) Environmental Engineering Program at Department of Biomedical, Chemical and Environmental Engineering has the expertise in conducting studies on the fate and transport of nanoparticles in aquatic and soil systems.  UC researchers have been conducting experimental and computational studies on the mobility, interaction with biomaterials, and aggregation and dissolution of nanoparticle and have published multiple research papers. UC has the capacity of conducting studies at different scales for understanding the interaction of nanoscale materials with natural and man-made surfaces and biological media. UC also has the expertise in the measuring and quantifying the effects of nanoparticles on bacterial biofilm using state-of-the art techniques. 
The University of Cincinnati?s (UC) Environmental Engineering Laboratories are well equipped with state-of-the-art equipment to carry out a variety of environmental analyses that are necessary for conducting this research.  In addition to well-equipped analytical laboratories UC has several bench-scale and pilot-scale laboratory facilities to perform air, water, and wastewater treatment studies, a one-of-a-kind microelectrode laboratory for biofilm analysis, an aerosol and air quality laboratory, a gas pollution control laboratory, and a state-of-the-art computational laboratory with an integrated computer data acquisition system.  The nature of this acquisition requires that the contractor possess unique system capabilities to conduct bench-scale and pilot-scale studies.  These unique capabilities are essential for the contract performance in order to assure that the reactor parts are made according to the specifications and achieve the expected chemical and mechanical prope rties of the catalyst.  This study includes molecular and physical characterizations with state-of-the-art techniques.
The principal investigator for this research is Professor George Sorial.  Professor Sorial Group has been working on unique studies similar to those conducted in the United Kingdom and other European countries for nanoparticals. Professor Sorial is a nationally recognized expert on micropollutant removal from drinking water, adsorption of micropollutants by activated carbon and alternative adsorbents, air biofiltration, electrochemical processes for destruction of contaminants, use of integrated technologies for effective remediation of contaminants, and the remediation of contaminated soils. The Sorial group also consists of 4 graduate students, one of which is a PhD student that has been working on similar research for the last two years. US EPA has had an established collaboration with UC and an ongoing work relationship with the Sorial Group since October, 2008.  This purchase order is intended to continue supporting this work.  It is therefore, to EPA?s advantage to keep  the current research going with the same people to have continuity of service and minimize disruption of the work.  
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 7 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Renita Tyus at the address shown above or email at tyus.renita@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

<SUBJECT>66--Two N2O Analyzers for EPA NVFEL
<SOLNBR>SOL-CI-14-00007
<RESPDATE>010614
<ARCHDATE>02052014
<CONTACT>Gerold Young

<a href="mailto:young.gerold@epa.gov">Young.Gerold@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase two (2) Laser Based N2O Analyzers to be used in heavy-duty engine testing site 5 and non-road testing site.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
Recently, in response to new N2O emission regulations, instrument manufacturers have developed laser based infrared spectrometers in which the source emits infrared radiation in a narrow band width.  This, in turn, eliminates the opportunity for interference as the infrared wavelength emitted by the source is focused in the region where N2O absorbs.
One (1) N2O analyzer will be used for continuous and batch analysis of dilute exhaust gas sampled either directly from a CVS (continuous sampling) or a Kynar bag (batch sampling).  The system will be installed in Heavy-Duty Test Site 5 (HD5 - Room 425) at the NVFEL.  This test site is equipped with a Horiba MEXA-7000 system for both continuous and bag analysis of criteria pollutants, and a Horiba Stars Test Cell Controller.   
One (1) N2O analyzer will be used for continuous dilute measurement for exhaust gas and batch sample measurement for ambient air.  The system will be installed in a Non-Road Testing Site (NRSI - Room 320) at the NVFEL.  The analyzer shall be identical to that of the Heavy Duty Test Site 5 unit with the exception of test cell host interface and sample measurement.  The non-road engine test site has three separate test stands (Sites 13, 14 & 15).  Sites 13 & 14 share a single CVS tunnel.  Site 15 has a dedicated CVS tunnel.  The non-road engine test site is equipped with two LabVIEW? based test cell controllers and two independent MEXA-7000 analyzer benches for each of the CVS systems.
The full Statement of Work, which will be included in the solicitation, describes and sets forth the installation and analyzer requirements for the two (2) N20 analyzers.  The equipment implementation described in the full Statement of Work shall allow for the integration and the ability to fully control the analyzer functions, and data collection, processing and reporting in keeping with the minimum requirements of current operations, while meeting the requirements of 40 CFR Part 1054/1065 in terms of features, performance, usage requirements, and calibration/verification requirements. 		 Award will be made on a Best Value Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  The solicitation should be issued on or about January 7, 2014 on EPA website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.
All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2660, or by email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<a href="mailto:gloria.thoguluva@us.army.mil">ACC - New Jersey</a>
<DESC>The Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM SW) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07860-5000, on behalf of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5422, is assessing handgun technologies as well as production capacity of the US small arms industrial base.  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). <br>  <br> To facilitate the assessment, the following information is requested: <br>  <br> 1. Performance Improvement: Request information on potential improvements in handgun performance in the areas of accuracy and dispersion out to 50m, terminal performance, modularity, reliability and durability in all environments. <br>  <br> *  The handgun and ammunition combination should, at a range of 50 meters, have a 90% or better probability of hit on a 4 inch circle when fired from a test fixture.  It must maintain this throughout the life of the system. Systems are encouraged to utilize ergonomic and design improvements to minimize the effects of greater recoil energies, reducing the degradation of shooter-in-the-loop dispersion thereby improving the probability of hit. <br>  <br> *  Modularity includes but is not limited to compatibility with accessory items to include tactical lights, lasers and sound suppressors. There is specific interest in designs that would be adaptable and/or adjustable to provide enhanced ergonomics that ensure 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male military personnel access to controls, such as the safety, magazine release, slide release and all other applicable controls. There is also interest in designs that offer these enhanced ergonomics while providing full ambidextrous controls.  <br>  <br> *  The handgun ammunition's terminal ballistics will be evaluated at ranges of 0-50m, over 0-14 inches of ballistic gelatin, to determine whether it provides more lethality when compared to the current U.S. Military M882 ammunition fired from the M9.  Ammunition evaluated will meet international law of war conventions that bound current general purpose military ammunition. The Pistol evaluated must be capable of chamber pressures equal to or greater than SAAMI specification for the given cartridge, with prolonged reliability equal to or greater than the current M9.  However, the ability to accommodate higher chamber pressures in excess of 20% over SAAMI spec without degradation of reliability is of specific interest. <br>  <br> *  Reliability and Durability includes but is not limited to Mean Rounds between Stoppage (MRBS), Mean Rounds Between Failure (MRBF) and Service Life.  There is specific interest in designs with ratings of at least 2,000 rounds MRBS, 10,000 rounds MRBF and 35,000 round Service Life.  <br>  <br> 2. Production capacity estimates.  Request information on minimum and maximum monthly production rates for a military handgun and associated ammunition as well as the lead times to achieve these production rates. This estimate should consider a US based production facility by the third year of deliveries. This capacity should be above and beyond any current production orders or current sales. If new facilities are planned or required, so state.  A list of State and Federal agencies, as well as foreign governments, that have adopted the handgun should also be included. <br>  <br> 3. Detailed descriptions of proposed handguns to include pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the principles as well as general and specific capabilities behind the submissions.  Physical dimensions, weight and safety features should be included.  <br>  <br> 4. Summarized and detailed test data from any certified test facility that addresses improvements in the areas proposed. Test operating procedures utilized and independent evaluations are also solicited. <br>  <br> 5. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate. Request estimated pricing for the submission based on the following quantities:  250,000 to 550,000 handguns. <br>  <br>  <br> This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government use of such information. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its Acquisition Strategy, Performance Work Statement and Performance Specification.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. <br>  <br> SUBMISSION INFORMATION: <br> Interested offerors should submit the information annotated above, in hard copy, by March 11, 2013 to: Army Contracting Command, Acquisition Center, ACC-NJ-SW, Bldg 9, Attn: Gloria Thoguluva, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07805. Electronic submissions may be sent to gloria.thoguluva.civ@mail.mil. Submissions shall not exceed 25 pages (8 x 11 inches), not including test data. Font shall be 12 pitch with one inch borders. All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. All information marked {Proprietary to company name} will not be disclosed outside of the Department of Defense.  <br>  <br> Interested firms should also provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number, e-mail address, and type of business (i.e. Small Business, Large Business, 8a Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business). <br>  <br> NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

The T-POD requires power and datalink interfaces with the aircraft. The pod will interface to the aircraft Ku band datalink architecture to provide for downlink of payload products and uplink of payload command/control. The ground workstation provides the command and control for the payload and the receiving, display and exploitation of the SIGINT data collected. The Government does not possess a technical data package or training material for the T-Pod system. This data is available only from the OEM, BAE systems.  <br>  <br> The specific requirements for which respondents must demonstrate their capability to perform are: 1) Provide Field Service Representative to support 24 hours per day, 7 days per week operations and maintenance of the T-POD system while deployed within the Afghanistan theater of operation under the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>STATE MEDICARE MEDICAID DATA INTEGRTION: SOURCES SOUGHT<br />Purpose of Notice</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE issued for the purpose of planning and market research. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and does not obligate the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Service (CMS) to award a contract.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses only (including 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide an IT development and data services solution in support of the CMS requirements for the State Medicare Medicaid Data Integration.</p>
<p>Prior to engaging in procurement activity to acquire vendors for the improvement of the efficiency of State Medicare and Medicaid Integration to improve the health care coordination for both Medicare and Medicaid recipients, the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is issuing this sources sought notice. The potential small businesses will need to demonstrate the ability to provide the services defined in this notice under Requirements.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>An estimated ten million individuals are enrolled in both the Medicare and Medicaid programs, accounting for total annual spending of more than $300 billion. These Medicare-Medicaid enrollees comprise 19% of Medicare enrollees but 27% of Medicare spending; in the Medicaid program, Medicare-Medicaid enrollees make up 15% of enrollees and 39% of spending. With the vast majority of Medicare-Medicaid enrollees receiving fragmented care, the service delivery system for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees is ripe for innovation. Integrated administrative, service delivery and payment models have the potential to achieve positive outcomes by streamlining access and care delivery for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees currently navigating a fragmented system.</p>
<p>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148, (ACA) created a number of opportunities to improve care for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees and established the Federal Coordinated Health Care Office (Medicare-Medicaid Coordination Office or "MMCO") to advance quality, reduce costs, and improve the experience of Medicare-Medicaid enrollees. The ACA also created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (the Innovation Center) within CMS to design, test, and evaluate innovative payment and service delivery models that reduce program expenditures while preserving or improving health outcomes and quality of care.</p>
<p>MMCO is responsible for providing education and tools for developing programs that align Medicare and Medicaid benefits and supporting state efforts to coordinate and align care.</p>
<p>Currently, existing Medicare-Medicaid enrollee data collection and reporting systems are fragmented and thus difficult for States to use in these efforts. States experience a number of challenges in using CMS data that create inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Working with qualified vendors, CMS hopes to decrease those inefficiencies by:</p>
<p>&bull; Developing protocols and common guidelines which will assist States with the integration of multiple datasets, database consolidation, data extraction for data used in addressing goals for care coordination given limited resources.</p>
<p>&bull; Creating a common taxonomy to assist States with the consistent interpretation of data fields across different databases.</p>
<p>&bull; Identifying Platforms for use in State data integration efforts</p>
<p>&bull; Assisting States to develop/find solutions for gaps associated with missing or inconsistent data (e.g. problems enrollment status on Medicare data resulting in flawed classification as dual-eligible (Full vs. Partial)), and many to one, one to many, and many to many relationships with crosswalk files that are used in the integration process.</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a crosswalk between differing enrollment periods and services to establish a minimum level of accuracy related to service use and expenditure patterns.</p>
<p>&bull; Assisting States with programming and complex algorithms that may be required to read and use the data for integration. Develop algorithms to match name, DOB, and other relevant demographic data.</p>
<p>&bull; Developing protocols for cleaning and linking data sets.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />The contractor should have the necessary infrastructure support to effectively interface with all stakeholders. This includes CMS program staff and State Medicaid Agencies.</p>
<p>The work that will be addressed under the future contract will require the vendor to have advanced knowledge of:</p>
<p>&bull; Data integration and of the variables, file construction, and data layouts of Medicare, Medicaid and private sector data sets. This shall include claims data, quality data and, in the case of managed care, encounter data. Specifically, the contractor should have familiarity with the following data sets:<br />&#61656; Traditional Fee-for-Service Medicare<br />&#61656; National Claims History Files that includes all Administrative claims data under the Medicare fee-for-service program<br />&#61656; Institutional data (e.g., Part A -- Hospitals)<br />&#61656; Professional data (e.g., Part B -- Physicians)<br />&#61656; Prescription drug event (PDE) data <br />&#61656; Encounter data<br />&#61656; Online Survey, Certification and Reporting (OSCAR)<br />&#61656; Minimum Data Set (MDS)<br />&#61656; Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)<br />&#61656; Quality Data(e.g., HEDIS) <br />&#61656; Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS)</p>
<p>&bull; Data integration platforms and experience with critical data integration techniques including but not limited to:<br />&#61656; Key steps in data integration<br />&#61656; Integrating large health care data sets using a wide variety of formats<br />&#61656; Integrating large health care data sets that reside in different locations or are maintained by different organizations<br />&#61656; Integrating large health care data sets such that a wide range of users can access and use data (accounting for a variety of roles of the data users and timeframe)<br />&#61656; Use and knowledge of a variety of data integration platforms such that the offeror can provide a comparative evaluation of optimal criteria for such platforms</p>
<p>&bull; Medicare and Medicaid programs and in the interactions between those programs as they pertain to the provision of care for Medicare-Medicaid enrollees.</p>
<p>&bull; Programming and analysis of large health care data sets including expertise in working with CMS data. The contractor's staff should be knowledgeable in conducting complex health services research using CMS data. The nature of these tasks will require multi-disciplinary skills including but not limited to; epidemiology, health economics, public health, statistics or biostatistics, health care, health services research and research design methodology.<br />The contractor should be prepared to work with MMCO's State Data Guidance contractor. This contractor provides information on the data available to States for care coordination and assistance requesting and using that data.</p>

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort by the Coast Guard Research and Development Center (RDC) to assess Non Lethal Impact Munitions (NLIM) technologies. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. <br /><br />The RDC is conducting research to identify both operational and advanced prototype technologies. &ldquo;Operational&rdquo; in this context refers to existing technologies and equipment that are currently used in commercial and/or Government application, while &ldquo;advanced prototype&rdquo; in this context refers to proven and near-proven technologies that are expected to be available in the commercial and/or Government market in the next 30 to 36 months. <br /><br />The RDC intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed systems analysis that quantifies and evaluates technology readiness and applicability, device or equipment capability, and acquisition (non-recurring) and life-cycle operating costs (recurring). You are invited to respond with information to assist the RDC with its market research to identify potential sources of Non Lethal Impact Munitions technology. <br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />During the past decade the Coast Guard has been outfitting its boarding team members with NLIM. At present, the Coast Guard employs several different NLIM systems to enforce maritime law. Mission execution by the Coast Guard typically follows the sequential activities involved in the Use of Force continuum. The Coast Guard would like to expand the application of Non-Lethal Technologies to compel compliance. It is anticipated that additional NLIM resources could reduce the need for use of additional, possibly lethal force. <br /><br />SPECIFIC TECHNICAL INFORMATION REQUESTED<br /><br />The Coast Guard RDC desires detailed information regarding NLIM technologies that can have proven non-lethal effects on human subjects. Submissions can include new applications of proven technologies but this request is not seeking any low Technical Readiness Level (TRL) concepts. The following information, or best available estimate, is requested for each proposed product/technology. If multiple products/technologies are presented by the same entity, the information should be specific to each product/technology. The information requested below will be used by the RDC to assess the benefits of NLIM capabilities against typical Coast Guard missions. <br /><br />The following questions/statements should be addressed for each product/technology described in your response to this RFI: <br /><br />A. General description of your NLIM capability. What products/technologies do you have that have the potential to compel compliance by non-lethal means? <br /><br />B. What agencies, governments, or other maritime service providers currently use the product/technology you described? <br /><br />C. If your technology is not currently available as a Commercial Off-the-Shelf product:&nbsp;<br />(1) Are there any development efforts or test activities currently underway or planned to mature your product/technology and/or assess its maturity?<br />(2)&nbsp;Describe the effort required to mature your advanced prototype product/technology to a fully tested, ready for production (i.e. DOD TRL 7 or higher) in terms of development time and expense. <br /><br />D. Please provide a response to the information requested/measures of effectiveness in the following list. Note: The technologies of interest are intended to be used in a maritime environment. In addition, the ability to withstand exposure to vibration and shock commonly encountered in a maritime environment should be addressed with respect to each product/technology. (Please define all distances given in meters.) <br />(1) Minimum safe distance for use.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to change the NSN Name &amp; Description for NSN 7510-00-579-2751.
<p>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.</p>
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-187-6488<br />Name:		Binder with Flexible Cover, Round Ring, Black, 1" Capacity, 6" x 9-1/2"<br />Description:	Round ring binder with flexible cover design. Loose-leaf binder features cloth cover. Accommodates 6" x 9-1/2" sheets. Black. 1" capacity. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-579-2751<br />Name:		Binder, Round Ring, Rigid Cover, Black, 2" Capacity, 8-1/2" x 11"<br />Description:	Round ring binder with a rigid cover design.  Accommodates 8-1/2" x 11" sheets with a 2" capacity.  Black.  UOI is EA.</p>
<p>NSN:		7510-00-187-6496<br />Name:		Binder with Flexible Cover, Round Ring, Black, 2" Capacity, 6" x 9-1/2"<br />Description:	Round ring binder with flexible cover design. Loose-leaf binder features cloth cover. Accommodates 6" x 9-1/2" sheets. Black. 2" capacity. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-187-6488<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7510-00-187-6488</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-579-2751<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7510-00-579-2751</p>
<p>NSN:			7510-00-187-6496<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	7510-00-187-6496</p>
<p><br />The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than July 15, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

<ARCHDATE>01092015
<CONTACT>Dewey Murdick, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-rfi-14-01@iarpa.gov
<DESC>IARPA-RFI-14-01<br /><br />Synopsis
<p>Request for Information (RFI): Lessons Learned Knowledge Management</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is seeking information about organizational lessons-learned analyses and knowledge management processes. This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes; this RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>Background &amp; Scope</p>
<p>Lessons Learned Knowledge Management (LLKM) is defined as the recording of experience-based lessons-learned analyses such that individuals can discover, retrieve, and apply lessons appropriate to their current circumstances. Lessons-learned analysis includes retrospective analysis of successes and failures, counterfactual analysis of alternative actions and likely consequences, and hypothetical analysis to recommend actions in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>IARPA is specifically interested in innovative LLKM methods that:<br />* Yield accurate lessons about the causes for successes and failures, forecasts about what would have occurred if different actions had been taken, and forecasts of outcomes that will occur in future situations where the lessons are applied.<br />* Mitigate bias in determining the lesson to be learned from experience (e.g., judgment and memory biases, such as fundamental attribution errors, hindsight memory bias), enhance counterfactual reasoning of what would have occurred (e.g., formal logics for counterfactual inference, statistical methods for counterfactual analyses, psychological research in counterfactual thinking and counterfactual analysis methods used by historians), or adapt rigorous case-study methods to lessons-learned analysis (e.g., formal case study methods used in scientific inquiry, case studies in business analysis, accident investigations, etc.).<br />* Test and evaluate whether experience-based lessons-learned methods yield accurate lessons (e.g., simulation-based testing, short-term forecasting), including metrics to assess the accuracy of identified causes. <br />* Address the KM recording of lessons in a manner that facilitates the discovery, retrieval, and application of lessons that are appropriate for future circumstances by individuals who were not participants in the original learning experience (e.g., use a structured argument to justify a lesson and then re-use the same structure argument to determine if applying the lesson in a new situation is justified.)<br />* Test the efficacy of the KM component of an LLKM system, including metrics to assess the selection of appropriate recorded lessons and their application.</p>
<p>Note that IARPA is interested in finding methods to learn and apply accurate lessons. For this RFI, IARPA is not interested in methods that facilitate organizations' adoption and dissemination of lessons.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI should answer any or all of the following questions:<br />1. What are existing methods for lessons-learned analysis? How do they attempt to separate accurate vs. inaccurate lessons?<br />2. What are novel approaches that could improve the accuracy and efficacy of lessons-learned analyses?<br />3. Are there existing approaches to knowledge management that support capturing lessons-learned knowledge? How do they encode learned-lessons? How do they attempt to ensure that relevant lessons are discovered and appropriately reused in future circumstances?<br />4. What are novel approaches to improving KM that could improve encoding, discovery, and appropriate reuse of lessons-learned knowledge?<br />5. What are possible test domains, test protocols, and metrics that could be used to estimate the extent to which a lessons-learned analysis yields accurate lessons?<br />6. What are possible test domains, test protocols, and metrics that could be used to estimate the extent to which a KM process results in appropriate reuse of lessons-learned knowledge?</p>
<p>Preparation Instructions to Respondents</p>
<p>IARPA requests that respondents submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues/obstacles, describe how the approach may address those issues/obstacles and comment on the expected performance and robustness of the proposed approach. If appropriate, respondents may also choose to provide a non-proprietary rough order of magnitude (ROM) regarding what such approaches might require in terms of funding and other resources for one or more years. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>IARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources from within and outside of the US. Because IARPA is interested in an integrated approach, responses from teams with complementary areas of expertise are encouraged.</p>
<p>Responses have the following formatting requirements:</p>
<p>1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with RFI-14-01;<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page executive summary;<br />3. A description (limited to 5 pages in minimum 12 point Times New Roman font, appropriate for single-sided, single-spaced 8.5 by 11 inch paper, with 1-inch margins) of the technical challenges and suggested approach(es);<br />4. A list of citations (any significant claims or reports of success must be accompanied by citations, and reference material MUST be attached);<br />5. Optionally, a single overview briefing chart graphically depicting the key ideas.</p>
<p><br />Submission Instructions to Respondents</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI are due no later than 4:00pm, Local Time, College Park, MD on January 10, 2014. All submissions must be electronically submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-14-01@iarpa.gov as a PDF document. Inquiries to this RFI must be submitted to dni-iarpa-rfi-14-01@iarpa.gov. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES</p>
<p>This is an RFI issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that IARPA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the information owner.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by IARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for purchase of a One Year Repair Coverage Service Contract for three PerkinElmer instruments.
Scope and Capabilities:  Repair Coverage Service Contracts are necessary to ensure that these instruments are operating at their optimum performance and to ensure that they are maintained in a safe condition. The instruments are: Optima 5300 DV (2 ea) and one NexION 300D ICP-MS. The requirements for all instruments on Repair Coverage Service Contract include:  Service calls are given priority status over non-service agreement holders, all parts (excluding consumables), labor, and travel expenses of the field service engineer to maintain instruments in normal working operation, and free telephone troubleshooting and technical support.  
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE: PerkinElmer is the company that manufactures the listed instruments and is the best source of service for all.  Performance issues are best known by the service engineers of the manufacturing company.  In addition, this kind of information is distributed to PerkinElmer service engineers as a service data bulletin.  Service engineers from PerkinElmer are more informed about any developing problems and the subsequent repairs or replacement parts needed in order to repair and improve these instruments as a result of their access to these service bulletins.  A service provider other than PerkinElmer may not be able to readily access this information or even acquire any service issue updates relevant to the instrument.  All PerkinElmer service engineers have access to applications specialists in their instrumentation area and are able to contact the design engineers for the specific instrument to discuss problems and find solution s.  Open access to such specific application and design expertise would not be available through another service provider.  Furthermore, PerkinElmer service engineers have extensive training in the instrument software systems.  Since these instruments are now controlled by software commands, it is critical that a service provider have a complete understanding of the software. Any other service provider not the manufacturer may not have complete knowledge of this software. Lastly, a rapid service response time is necessary for all of these instrument systems.  PerkinElmer has a local service engineer with an excellent service response record making it unlikely that there would be excessive instrument down-time. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this posting must be in writing. A det ermination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All questions should be directed to Lorraine Lesieur via email to lesieur.lorraine@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 7 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC><p>i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(ii) The solicitation number associated with this requirement is DJA-14-AHDQ-R-0016. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>(iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-71.</p>

The period of performance will consist of a base period of one year plus four one-year option periods; for a total of 60 months. The anticipated award is February 28, 2014.</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (Jul 2013) applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>Parties responding to this solicitation who believe they can provide the required hotel accommodations described herein may submit their proposal in accordance with their standard commercial practices (e.g., on company letterhead, formal quote form, etc.) and must include the following information: 1) company's complete mailing and remittance addresses; 2) discounts for prompt payment if applicable; 3) Dun &amp; Bradstreet number; 4) copy of System for Award Management (SAM) Registration (which may be accessed at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us); 5) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and; 6) pricing in accordance with the CLIN specified herein (see Attachment A- Supplies or Services and Prices/Rates) and; 7) technical response addressing capability to provide hotel accommodation in accordance with the requirements herein inclusive of past performance information with no less than three (3) references.</p>
<p>To aid in the evaluation process, proposals shall be clearly and concisely written, indexed/cross indexed, and logically assembled. Format requirements and page limitations are established to facilitate the ease of evaluation and to assist in determining whether Offerors are able to concisely communicate a clear understanding of the requirement in their proposed approach and capabilities. Prospective Offerors are asked to bear in mind that all material submitted should be directly pertinent to the requirements of this solicitation and that extraneous promotional material or brochures shall not be submitted nor evaluated. All pages of each volume shall be appropriately numbered (i.e., "Page 1 of 5," etc.), and identified with the name of the Offeror, the date, and the solicitation number. Offerors shall furnish the proposal in two separate volumes as follows:</p>
<p>VOLUME 1 - TECHNICAL:</p>
<p>The Offeror's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to provide the requirements outlined in the RFP. Additionally, all offerors must submit copies of their Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Certification and State Fire Marshall's Safety Inspection along with proposal. If not, proposal will not be considered or evaluated. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal that addresses the following evaluation factors:</p>

<p>2) Site Visit - The offeror must be available to allow ATF Representatives entry into one or more rooms of the accommodations being proposed to fulfill the requirement.</p>

This information shall consist of a one (1) page introductory matrix listing the offerors' past performance references. The offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references. The offeror should include rationale supporting the assertion of relevance for each reference. These references should also be from different contracts. To be considered, past performance data may not be older than three (3) years (normally 3, but could vary based on the industry) from the date of the proposal, and may include active contracts; if over one year old. Further, offerors should include a list of all relevant ATF on-going contracts or contracts completed for the specified period.</p>
<p>Past performance references must be as having provided hotel accommodations as a prime contractor on previous or current contracts that are similar in size, scope, and complexity as identified in the SOW.</p>
<p>Offerors shall forward the Past and Present Performance Survey (Attachment C), to offeror's references. The references shall forward their completed surveys to the Contracting Officer, NOT BACK TO THE OFFEROR. The surveys shall be delivered via email directly from the offeror's references to Frankie.Murphy@atf.gov.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to use publicly available reports and data from the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) found on the web at http://www.ppirs. The Government may also use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts identified by offerors. For each reference, provide:</p>
<p>a. Reference Name (Company or Entity)<br />b. Program Title<br />c. Contracting Agency/Private Company<br />d. Contract Number/Task Order Number (if applicable)<br />e. Brief description of the contract effort, including results and successes<br />f. Type of Contract<br />g. Period of Performance<br />h. Original contract dollar value and current or actual dollar value<br />i. Actual completion date<br />j. Contact names, addresses, telephone numbers, Fax numbers and e-mail addresses of current, or last (if contract completed) Program Director/Manager and/or Contract Manager.</p>
<p>Page Limitation: The technical proposal submission shall be limited to five (5) one-sided pages, excluding certification documents, state fire marshall's safety inspection, past performance reference information and any cover letter/title pages. OFFERORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL ONLY EVALUATE THE FIRST FIVE (5) PAGES OF ANY TECHNICAL PROPOSAL THAT EXCEEDS THE PAGE LIMITATION. Please do not include additional information as an attached appendix.</p>
<p>In order for the technical proposal to be evaluated strictly on the merit of the material submitted, NO PRICE/RATE INFORMATION IS TO BE INCLUDED IN VOLUME I.</p>
<p>The evaluation and award procedures in FAR 15.305 will be applied to this acquisition.</p>
<p>VOLUME II - COST/PRICE/RATES (non-rated)</p>
<p>ATF is seeking hotel accommodations for students and instructors attending explosives training courses on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, AL. The proposed nightly rate must be at or below GSA's established per diem rates throughout the base and option periods of the contract.</p>
<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors (listed in descending order or relative importance) shall be used to evaluate proposals:</p>
<p>A. Lodging Accommodations/Amenities<br />B. Site Visit<br />C. Past Performance<br />D. Price/Rates</p>
<p>Factor A through C are referred to as the technical factors. Factors A through D are in order of relative importance. Factor A through C (when combined) are approximately equal to price. As the technical proposals approach equality, price will become more important in making the award determination.</p>
<p>In awarding the proposed contract, ATF will select a contractor who presents the overall best value to the Government, considering the technical merit of the contractor's proposal. In the event that two or more proposals are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the offeror submitting the lowest proposed prices/rates. It should be noted that award may also be made to other than the lowest proposed prices/rates if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated proposal, if the Government determines that a price/rate premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to make an award on the basis of initial proposals without discussions (although the right to conduct discussions, if necessary, is reserved). Offerors are therefore cautioned that each initial proposal should contain the offeror's best at or below GSA per diem prices/rates.</p>
<p>Technical Proposal</p>
<p>Technical proposals submitted in response to this RFP will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>1) Lodging Accommodations/Amenities - The degree to which offeror demonstrated the capability to successfully provide lodging accommodations and amenities as described in the SOW.</p>
<p>2) Site Visit - The degree to which a physical visit to the proposed facility meets the needs of the Government.</p>
<p>3) Past Performance - The extent to which the Offeror's past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successfully providing the described accommodations similar in size, scope and complexity of this solicitation. The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the PPIRS. The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources, not just those contracts or references identified by offeror. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An offeror without a record of past performance for whom information on relevant past performance is not available will be evaluated as "neutral".</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price/rates for all options to the total price/rates for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices/rates are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Nov 2013). Offerors shall provide representations and certifications (FAR 52.212-3) electronically via website at https://www.unitedstatesbusinessregistration.us. A copy of the on-line representations and certifications submission shall be included in the offeror's response.</p>
<p>(xi) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (Sept 2013), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Nov 2013), applies to this acquisition.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has ( ) has not ( ), within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of provision) <br /><br />52.209-7, Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision- <br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

<p>(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from Date of Award through Contract Expiration Date. <br />(b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), the U.S. Government's development finance institution, requires a contractor with proven international experience to provide all conference planning, Agenda/speaker development, recruitment, promotion, logistics and business advisory services for one international business and investment conference focused on the power sector in Africa to be held in Kenya. An investment conference is defined by OPIC as a conference in which participants are interested in investing (i.e. investing capital in projects or businesses in Africa) in sustainable economic development<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>rather than exporting, (although US capital investments do become magnets for US exports over time.)</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">It is anticipated that the conference will take place in June 2014 and will probably occur between a Monday and a Wednesday or a Tuesday and a Thursday, depending upon availability. This is one of the aspects of the conference that the contractor will assist in determining. Alternate timing should June dates fail to materialize, may be September/October 2014.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6, and supplemental information included in this notice. The Louisiana National Guard will be awarding a Firm-Fixed Price Contract. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a request for quotes (RFQ) in accordance with FAR Parts 12 & 13. The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-64 Effective on January 17, 2013. Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations supplement (DFARS) can be accessed on the internet at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  <br>  <br> The solicitation W912NR-14-T-0002 is issued as a Request for Quote. This procurement is UNRESTRICTED. The NAICS code for this acquisition is721110 - Hotels (except Casino Hotels) and Motels. The small business size standard for this NAICS code is $30 million.  <br>  <br> This solicitation is for a firm fixed price contract and will be awarded to the lowest priced technically acceptable. The Louisiana Army National Guard needs a quote for lodging, meals, meeting space and AV equipment for dates below and all associated charges for this event. All items should be quoted as individual line items (line items breakdown attached). If additional lines are required annotate appropriately. Our intent is to award a single contract for April Yellow Ribbon Event for pre-deployment, separation and post deployment consolidated events. It is the preference of the Louisiana National Guard to utilize one (1) facility that can accommodate all requirements but will review proposals. The meeting spaces requirements are described on attached and will need to be on one (1) or two (2) floors.  <br>  <br> The dates requested are April 4-6, April 25-27, May 2-4 or May 16-18. Dates are flexible but location is New Orleans, LA. If the hotel cannot accommodate all lodging/meeting spaces then it is the responsibility of the hotel to arrange an over-flow hotel within walking distance (approximately .25 mile) of the base hotel. This will be a firm fixed priced contract. The contract will be awarded to lowest priced technically acceptable. A site visit to the hotel may be required prior to award. Hotel accommodations must include lodging and meeting spaces to accommodate requirements listed below, meals, AV equipment, parking for guests and charter buses, complimentary internet for all rooms, provide 3:00pm checkout for each guest, and must not be located within 1 mile of a casino. <br>  <br> If third party vendors or event planners bid on event, they must be available during the entire timeframe to be physically present at the hotel to manage the contract requirements and handle any problems that may occur at no additional expense to the government or hotel. Additionally they must be willing to attend planning meetings as required at no additional expense to the government or hotel.  <br>  <br> Lodging and meal rates must be at or below the per diem rates. To figure out the per diem rates go to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120.  <br>  <br> For quoting this event, be sure to follow the Line Item Structure listed below. I have attached a Quote Submission form which has the line items listed out and the green initiatives requirements. This form must be completed in order to be considered a responsive quote. Please also be sure to submit a sample menu for the meals.  <br>  <br> The following FAR/DFAR clauses and provisions are applicable to this acquisition:  <br> 52.202-1 Definitions JAN 2012  <br> 52.203-3 Gratuities APR 1984  <br> 52.203-5 Covenant Against Contingent Fees APR 1984  <br> 52.203-7 Anti-Kickback Procedures OCT 2010  <br> 52.204-7 System for Award Management JUL 2013  <br> 52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance JUL 2013 <br> 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items FEB 2012  <br> 52.216-24 Limitation Of Government Liability APR 1984  <br> 52.216-25 Contract Definitization OCT 2010  <br> 52.222-3 Convict Labor JUN 2003  <br> 52.222-19 Child Labor -- Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies MAR 2012  <br> 52.222-21 Prohibition Of Segregated Facilities FEB 1999  <br> 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity MAR 2007  <br> 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Veterans SEP 2010  <br> 52.222-36 Affirmative Action For Workers With Disabilities OCT 2010  <br> 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Veterans SEP 2010  <br> 52.222-50 Combating Trafficking in Persons FEB 2009  <br> 52.223-6 Drug-Free Workplace MAY 2001  <br> 52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policies To Ban Text Messaging While Driving AUG 2011  <br> 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases JUN 2008  <br> 52.225-25 Prohibition on Contracting with Entities Engaging in Certain Activities or Transactions Relating to Iran-Representation and Certifications.

If you need any additional assistance getting registered, please send me an email and I will send you additional instructions.  <br>  <br> All questions, quote submission form, sample menus and hotel information in response to this notice must be submitted by email to chad.g.travis.mil@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Quotes where all of the rooms are at the same location (hotel) will be evaluated first and will be based on lowest priced technically acceptable.  If we do not receive adequate quotes that can accommodate all requirements (lodging and meeting spaces), we will then evaluate quotes where the lodging and meeting spaces are at two locations and evaluate them based on lowest priced technically acceptable.  Due to mission requirements, if two locations are quoted they must be within a quarter mile (.25) and not across any major roads or freeways unless there is a pedestrian walkway.  A site visit to the hotel may be conducted prior to award to ensure that the hotel meets the requirements and is technically acceptable. The deadline for quotes is December 12th, 2013 by 10:00am CST.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a Brand Name requirement for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number RFQ0097-14 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and should be referenced on all correspondence. The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-71, effective on November 25, 2013. This solicitation is considered an unrestricted procurement. The NAICS code is 541519. The small business size standard is $25.5 million dollars.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The EEOC, Acquisition Services Division is requesting quotes on a brand name specific basis for the purchase of Notify Technology Corp. software required to synchronize e-mail and personal information management (PIM) data between servers and wireless networks and devices and to centralize management and control of the Commission's wireless device platforms. The EEOC is migrating from the older BlackBerry&reg; devices that currently use the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) to receive e-mail, calendaring, and remote management of BlackBerry devices. The newer BlackBerry devices are no longer compatible with the BES therefore, another solution is needed. Not only has the Commission purchased new BlackBerry devices (RIM), the EEOC has also purchased Apple (IOS), Android, and MS-Windows devices as well. To meet this new need the Commission selected Notifylink an Notify MDM as an e-mail, calendaring, and management solution for these new devices. The Commission will place the Notifylink and NotifyMDM applications on EEOC's Government furnished smart phones. However, we have discovered that there are some management limitations with BlackBerry devices. Currently, Notify is much more compatible with the BlackBerry devices than any other product. The Brand Name Justification for the above required services is attached.<br /><br />SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. CLIN 0001: Subscription Fee for NotifyLink on Demand for 65 Product Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $_____ per Device; CLIN 0002: Annual Fee for NotifyMDM (Mobile Device Management) on Demand for 15 Product Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $_____ per Device; and, CLIN 0003: Subscription Fee for NotifyLink on Demand for 329 Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $____ per Device. TOTAL PRICE TO GOVERNMENT: $____ (CLIN Nos. 0001 thru 0003). PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The period of performance will be 12 months from the date of award. The estimated award date is December 16, 2013. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: EEOC Headquarters, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION. The quoter shall submit their quotation in two volumes.

Part II: The name, title, telephone number, fax number and email address of the point of contact. Part III: The nine digit DUNS and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code with their quote. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all contractors who provide goods/services to the EEOC to be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at www.sam.gov to receive contract award or payments. The Government intends to award a single firm fixed-price purchase order to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other price related factors considered. Quotes must be firm-fixed priced and include all quantities listed above on an all or none basis. BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be made based on best value using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD. The evaluation of quotations shall be on GO or No-Go basis and will occur in two sequential stages: Technical evaluation determines whether quotations are technically acceptable or unacceptable, followed by a price evaluation. GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows: (1) Authorized NotifyLink/MDM Reseller: the quoter must provide evidence that it is an authorized Notify software reseller. The quoter must provide a Corporate line card that clearly states this information. For verification, the quoter must provide a website where the information is available. The authorized reseller must be able to provide all of the technical requirements that are specified in the RFQ. (2) Time and Delivery: The quoter must provide a written statement with their quote indicating that the quoter can meet the delivery requirements and provide services for the entire period of performance. (3)Experience on Similar Contracts: The quoter must provide evidence that it has successfully performed a minimum of three (3) contracts for the same or similar services within the past two (2) years to include contract type, contract number, contract value, point of contact name and telephone number, and the type of service provided. NO-GO: An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies. The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. If the quoter is other than the manufacturer, then documentation must be provided showing that the quoter is authorized to resell the NotifyLink and NotifyMDM product. Once the quotes have been determined technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC. Interested quoters must submit questions regarding this solicitation via email to the Contracting Officer, Doreen Starkes, attn: Doreen.Starkes@eeoc.gov, with a cc to the Alternate Contracting Officer, Cassandra Bates at: Cassandra.Bates@eeoc.gov, not later than Friday, December 6, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. (Washington, DC local time).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 01-IARPA-BAA-13-07, JANUS</span><br /><br />This amendment corrects errors in the original BAA. Amended regions are highlighted in yellow.<br />
<p>1.	Section 1.B.4  Table 1 - Metrics and Milestones by Phase: Change legend text</p>
<p>Replace third bullet to read:<br />Model Size: the maximum storage size permitted to encode a single subject. This is not a requirement for a separate, independently identifiable, per subject representation. Size will be measured in aggregate (e.g., the maximum for 500 subjects x 32MB is 16GB).</p>
<p>2.	Section 4.A.1 Proposal Information.  The fourth paragraph is amended to read as follows:</p>
<p>The Government intends to use employees of Scitor Corporation, and its sub-contractor, RAI Government Services, LLC, and Noblis to provide expert advice regarding portions of the proposals submitted to the Government.  Booz Allen Hamilton will also provide administrative support in carrying out the evaluation process. These personnel will have signed and be subject to the terms and conditions of Government non-disclosure agreements. By submission of its proposal, an offeror agrees that its proposal information may be disclosed to employees of these organizations for the limited purpose stated above. Offeror's objection to the disclosure of information to these non-Government advisors shall be provided in writing to the Contracting Officer before the date set for receipt of proposals. The written objection shall include a detailed statement for the basis of the objection. Blanket Disclosure Statements found on proposal cover sheets contained in the Technical and Cost Proposals do not constitute written objection to the Government's use of non-Government Advisors.</p>
<p><br />3.	  Section 4.A.2 Proposal Format:  <br />All proposals must be in the format given below. Nonconforming proposals may be rejected without review. Proposals shall consist of two volumes: "Volume 1 - Technical and Management Proposal" and "Volume 2 - Cost Proposal."

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) <br />This acquisition will utilize Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection criteria in accordance with FAR 15.101-2. Technical acceptability is considered the most important factor. By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offerors shall be treated equally except for prices. Failure to meet a requirement will result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. For the purpose of award, the Government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>

Traceability means the awardee must be able to show clear, documented, auditable paper trail for ownership and transfer of each part from the OEM to the final vendor. Reconditioned or used materials are not acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 Cost/Price</p>

<p>Past performance shall be viewed as a responsibility determination. In the event two or more technically acceptable offerors bid an identical total price, the Contracting Officer may evaluate responsibility of the contractor by seeking relevant performance information through sources such AMMIS inventory system at the Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center and records posted on Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) and Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Retrieval System (PPRS), or other government data bases and other sources that are available.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC> <br> This Amendment is being issued due to adjustments made to the FMU-160A/B Performance Specification and program timeline.  The amended solicitation will be issued under the FY13 solicitation number, W15QKN-13-R-0068-0001, which will reflect a revision to Performance Specification involving the Height of Burst requirement and the E3 tests.  The required schedule has been changed to accommodate additional time to complete contractual events, including Design Verification Test and First Article Test. <br>  <br>  <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br>  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command (ACC) - New Jersey, on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM-CAS), anticipates issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about September 10, 2013 for the manufacturing, inspection, testing, and delivery of the FMU-160 A/B HIGH FRAGMENTATION (HFF) PROXIMITY FUZE, with POINT DETONATING (PD) backup.  The program satisfies the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) requirements for fiscal years 2013-2017, for AC-130 Gunship training and tactical missions.     <br>       <br>   The FMU-160A/B Fuze is a radio frequency HF proximity fuze with a PD backup. The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 332993 and the FSC code is 1390.  The NSN for the FMU-153 A/B PD/DLY Fuze is 1390-01-616-7163.  The FMU-160 A/B Fuze is used to detonate the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF) High Explosive (HE) Projectile Gun Unit (PGU) 45/B Cartridge.  The PGU-45/B is an asset on the AC-130 Gunship, and is fired out of a modified 105mm Howitzer.  The FMU-160 A/B is set to provide a 15-foot height of burst.  The height of burst optimizes the lethality of the 105mm High Fragmentation (HF), High Explosive (HE), PGU-45/B Cartridge.    <br>      <br>   Competition for this requirement will be restricted under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (3), and FAR 6.302-3 (a)(2)(i), Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Development, or Research Capability; or Expert Services, from companies within the National Technology and Industrial Base (NTIB) in order to maintain or create the required domestic capability within the U.S., its outlying areas, and Canada.  Under the authority, the contract will require that the contractor obtain the FMU-160 A/B Fuze assembly, and the detonator and explosive train (to include the explosives themselves) from within the NTIB.  The balance of FMU-160 A/B Fuze sub-assemblies and sub-components are unrestricted.  The contract type will be Firm Fixed Price (FFP).  The effort will result in award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract consisting of 5 one-year ordering periods, with priced ordering ranges.  The estimated maximum contract value will be $22,250,000 with a minimum guarantee of $700,000.     Each ordering period will consist of the following ordering ranges:  500-2,000; 2,001-5,000; 5,001-20,000.     <br>      <br>   The technical data package is Distribution quote mark D quote mark - approved for release to Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD contractors.  The requirement will be solicited/manufactured against a Performance Specification.  The requirement will require the contractor to work with explosives.  Any request by DoD Contractors for Distribution Level  quote mark D quote mark  data shall be accompanied by the following:  a fully executed DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement, and a completed AMSTA-AR 1350.  After review of the forms, offerors will be notified of the disposition of approval/disapproval to receive the TDP.  To receive the forms to request the TDP, please contact Aretha Jones, Contract Specialist, email: aretha.y.jones.civ@mail.mil., (609)562-6653 or Linda A.

<DESC>As of 11 March 2013, Response Date has been modified FROM: 11 March 2013 TO: 29 March 2013.  <br>  <br> The Program Manager for Soldier Weapons (PM SW) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07860-5000, on behalf of the Program Executive Office Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5422, is assessing handgun technologies as well as production capacity of the US small arms industrial base.  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI).  <br>    <br>  To facilitate the assessment, the following information is requested:  <br>    <br>  1. Performance Improvement: Request information on potential improvements in handgun performance in the areas of accuracy and dispersion out to 50m, terminal performance, modularity, reliability and durability in all environments.  <br>    <br>  *  The handgun and ammunition combination should, at a range of 50 meters, have a 90% or better probability of hit on a 4 inch circle when fired from a test fixture.  It must maintain this throughout the life of the system. Systems are encouraged to utilize ergonomic and design improvements to minimize the effects of greater recoil energies, reducing the degradation of shooter-in-the-loop dispersion thereby improving the probability of hit.  <br>    <br>  *  Modularity includes but is not limited to compatibility with accessory items to include tactical lights, lasers and sound suppressors. There is specific interest in designs that would be adaptable and/or adjustable to provide enhanced ergonomics that ensure 5th percentile female through 95th percentile male military personnel access to controls, such as the safety, magazine release, slide release and all other applicable controls. There is also interest in designs that offer these enhanced ergonomics while providing full ambidextrous controls.   <br>    <br>  *  The handgun ammunition's terminal ballistics will be evaluated at ranges of 0-50m, over 0-14 inches of ballistic gelatin, to determine whether it provides more lethality when compared to the current U.S. Military M882 ammunition fired from the M9.  Ammunition evaluated will meet international law of war conventions that bound current general purpose military ammunition. The Pistol evaluated must be capable of chamber pressures equal to or greater than SAAMI specification for the given cartridge, with prolonged reliability equal to or greater than the current M9.  However, the ability to accommodate higher chamber pressures in excess of 20% over SAAMI spec without degradation of reliability is of specific interest.  <br>    <br>  *  Reliability and Durability includes but is not limited to Mean Rounds between Stoppage (MRBS), Mean Rounds Between Failure (MRBF) and Service Life.  There is specific interest in designs with ratings of at least 2,000 rounds MRBS, 10,000 rounds MRBF and 35,000 round Service Life.   <br>    <br>  2. Production capacity estimates.  Request information on minimum and maximum monthly production rates for a military handgun and associated ammunition as well as the lead times to achieve these production rates. This estimate should consider a US based production facility by the third year of deliveries. This capacity should be above and beyond any current production orders or current sales. If new facilities are planned or required, so state.  A list of State and Federal agencies, as well as foreign governments, that have adopted the handgun should also be included.  <br>    <br>  3. Detailed descriptions of proposed handguns to include pictures, brochures, etc. that will convey the principles as well as general and specific capabilities behind the submissions.  Physical dimensions, weight and safety features should be included.   <br>    <br>  4. Summarized and detailed test data from any certified test facility that addresses improvements in the areas proposed. Test operating procedures utilized and independent evaluations are also solicited.  <br>    <br>  5. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Estimate. Request estimated pricing for the submission based on the following quantities:  250,000 to 550,000 handguns.  <br>    <br>    <br>  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services or hardware. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or Government use of such information. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.  The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its Acquisition Strategy, Performance Work Statement and Performance Specification.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to same. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.  <br>    <br>  SUBMISSION INFORMATION:  <br>  Interested offerors should submit the information annotated above, in hard copy, by March 11, 2013 to: Army Contracting Command, Acquisition Center, ACC-NJ-SW, Bldg 9, Attn: Gloria Thoguluva, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07805.

<DESC><strong>UPDATE<br /><br />The response date is extended to 12:00 noon on December 9, 2013.&nbsp; Any questions pertaining to this sources sought should be submitted via email to Tania Gates at <a href="mailto:Tania.Gates@fda.hhs.gov">Tania.Gates@fda.hhs.gov</a> no later than 3:00 pm on December 4, 2013.&nbsp; No questions will be accepted after this time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice to Small Businesses<br /></span></strong><br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from qualified small business concerns [8(a), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Businesses, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)]. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small businesses.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Background<br /><br /></strong></span>This Sources Sought Notice replaces the sources sought originally posted on August 13, 2013, (SS No. FDA-Off-Site-RIM-00014). This notice is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its Centers. The purpose of this Source Sought is to help the FDA understand the market and technical solutions capable of providing the full range of services described in the draft SOW. FDA will use this market research information to assess the market's capability to successfully perform FDA's Off-Site Document Control Center requirements.
<p>FDA welcomes responses from all interested parties. FDA does not intend to make a selection decision or award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the outcome of the FDA's review of the information received. Additionally, the FDA does not intend to hold discussions concerning this sources sought with any interested parties. However, FDA reserves the right to contact vendors if additional information is required.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the FDA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Single Hybrid Firm-Fixed-Price/Labor Hour/Time and Material Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for each task or a combination of tasks (refer to Statement of Work). The ID/IQ will have a one-year period of performance plus four one-year option periods. The maximum value of the ID/IQ is estimated to be $103 Million. If at least two or more qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611 (Administrative Management and General Management Consulting) with a small business size standard of $14.0 million applies to this requirement. All documents applicable to this Sources Sought Notice have been submitted as attachments.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p>Responses to the sources sought should not exceed 10 pages in length. They should be submitted via email to Tania Gates at tania.gates@fda.hhs.gov by <strong>12:00 noon on December 9, 2013. (UPDATED)</strong></p>
<p>A complete response to the sources sought should include answers to all of the questions below. Please note that a respondent's failure to provide a complete response to a question will be interpreted to mean that it does not understand the question and does not demonstrate the capability to provide services required. Responses should demonstrate capability (i.e. specific projects), not merely affirm the respondent's capability (e.g.: The response must go beyond the statement that, "XYZ company can scan documents.").</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Questions:</strong></span></p>
<p>1. The attached draft SOW describes the following major tasks under which task orders may be released to obtain specific services related to FDA's offsite document control center. Please demonstrate your capability for each of the following task areas:</p>
<p>1. Program and Task Order Management Support; <br />2. Document Processing, Handling, Correspondence, and Delivery;<br />3. Document Scanning; <br />4. Document Data Entry Services, Data Analysis, Tracking Services, and Stakeholder Support; <br />5. Official Archive of Government Records; and<br />6. Transition Work Activities.</p>
<p>2. This requirement is for an offsite document control center. The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, equipment, and supplies to perform the work described in the ID/IQ Statement of Work. Except as specified in the Statement of Work, the contractor must be able to provide the facilities and infrastructure necessary to perform all task areas. Appendix A presents the initial set of off-site workload requirements for CDRH. It is anticipated, but not guaranteed, that the first task order issued under an ID/IQ for an offsite document control center would encompass these requirements. Further, task orders may require the Contractor to store the FDA documents for a period of time to be specified in the task order. In "Question and Answer" format, please provide the following information with respect to the facilities in which you would perform the work and/or your ability to obtain them:</p>
<p>&bull; Where is the facility located?<br />&bull; What is the square footage of the facility?<br />&bull; Do you currently own or lease the facility?<br />&bull; Does the facility current satisfy the security requirements set forth in the draft Statement of Work? If not, how long would it take to alter the facility to satisfy the security requirements?<br />&bull; What equipment (e.g. scanners, IT equipment, furniture, phones, vehicles, mail totes, hand trucks, telecommunications equipment, access control equipment) are in the facility?<br />&bull; What additional equipment would you need to obtain in order to satisfy solicitation requirements?</p>
<p>3. Are there any gaps (task areas not included in the Draft Statement of Work) that you believe to be necessary to obtain FDA's objectives. If you identified any gaps in the task areas in the Draft Statement of Work, please describe any relevant projects where your company provided the service or support identified and what complementary objectives were achieved. Are the described task areas and the capabilities required clearly defined? What changes, additions, updates, and clarifications would you suggest?</p>
<p>4. How would you suggest pricing this requirement? Would the facilities and equipment costs be included in the fully burdened labor rates? If not, how would they be priced (e.g. per square foot, per piece of equipment)?</p>
<p>5. The IGCE for this requirement is not yet finalized; however, it is estimated that the ID/IQ ceiling could be as high as $103M for the FDA. Please briefly - no more than two to three paragraphs - describe your capability to staff and manage a project of this magnitude and complexity in terms of project scope and multiple task order awards. Also please describe any certifications (e.g. ISO or CMMI) that demonstrate proven management and quality outcomes.</p>
<p>NOTE: if the Sources Sought results into a small business set aside solicitation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, the prime contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for services, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Is your Firm able to perform at least 50 percent of the requirements with in-house labor?</p>
<p>6. Please provide documentation of the size of your business specifying whether you are classified as a small business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business and/or SBA 8(a) certified small business. SBA approved joint venture and mentor prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements (if applicable) should be included with your size determination documentation. Additionally, please demonstrate your firm's capability to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>7. If you are a SBA 8(a) certified small business please indicate the relationship your business has with any large businesses (i.e. a mentorship or joint-venture) and how the business's resources can assist with your capability to perform the requirement. Please provide your SBA approved agreement.</p>
<p>8. Please provide the following:<br /><br />a. Organization name<br />b. DUNS number<br />c. Organization's website<br />d. Contact Name<br />e. Contact Telephone<br />f. Contact E-mail address<br />g. Size designation<br />h. Number of employees in your organization<br />i. Your organization's three (3) year annual revenue</p>
<p>9. Provide information concerning contract vehicles available to be used by the FDA in acquiring the services outlined in the draft SOW (GSA Federal Schedules, Government wide Acquisition Contract, etc.).</p>
<p>Attachments:<br />1. Draft IDIQ SOW<br />2. Appendix A - Draft CDRH Workload<br />3. Appendix B - Summary of Volume Submissions<br />4. CDRH Offsite Real Property Clauses</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Carderock Division (NSWCCD) is hereby issuing a Market Survey from all potential sources who may be interested in the design and manufacturing of Load Banks in the 400-10000kW range for use in a Navy facility. The information provided will assist NSWCCD in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies. This survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. However, respondents must be able to demonstrate that they currently produce the above mentioned technology in the power ranges specified for commercial or other military applications. At no cost to the Government, responding vendors may continue technical dialogue with this Market Survey's Point of Contact after the initial response is provided.<br /><br />The key element for this notice is that this is purely designed to provide the NSWCCD with a general idea of who can provide this type of service.&nbsp; This is purely for information gathering purposes only.

<DESC>**Amendment 0006 to this presolicitation notice is to update the estimated release date for the solicitation. There is no response required for this presolicitation notice and questions will not be accepted at this time either by telephone or e-mail.      <br>        <br>        <br>     This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals. This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation has been scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) to the vendor community on or about January 6, 2014 which will be available for 45 days. Specifications of this requirement shall be provided in the solicitation under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.        <br>              <br>     This presolicitation notice follows a Request for Information which was released as RFI Number RFIPRODDEVP on January 11, 2013.        <br>              <br>      The solicitation will be unrestricted and will allow for full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.        <br>              <br>     Requirement Description:       <br>              <br>     This requirement is for all medical product development services required to support the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA), other U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) subordinate commands, and Joint Project Manager (JPM) Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) (formerly Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS)) in their missions to develop and manage medical materiel to protect and sustain the Warfighter on point for the Nation.  This acquisition will provide multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for services to support their missions.  Support services include support in the following areas, intended to support all aspects of product development: Technical/Administrative, Meeting and Informational Products, Clinical Development, Non-Clinical Development, Medical Product Manufacturing, Regulatory, Training, Protocol, and Information Technology.  This is a new requirement integrating and standardizing a multitude of different requirements into a comprehensive, efficient and economical approach to providing contract support for medical advanced development. This contract vehicle may be used by other activities of the Defense Health Agency when/if the USAMRMC is incorporated thereunder.       <br>              <br>     Background:       <br>              <br>     The USAMMDA and USAMMA, both subordinate commands of USAMRMC, are the Department of Defense's (DoD) advanced development organizations for medical products designed to protect and preserve the lives of Service Members.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA develop new drugs, vaccines, devices and medical support equipment that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical and preventative care to the DoD, and maximize survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA direct, control, manage, and focus the development of medical materiel systems to meet Service-unique and joint Service performance, schedule, and cost requirements.         <br>              <br>     The USAMMDA and USAMMA Project Managers develop and field medical products for the US Armed Forces in conjunction with the Army Medical Department Center and School (the combat developer) and other service inputs (external partners).  Project Manager assigns product development to individual product managers and the product managers (PdMs), with support from the Division of Regulated Activities and Compliance (DRAC) and Clinical Support Services Division (CSSD), take promising new concepts and technologies developed in the USAMRMC laboratories and in the academic and commercial sectors, manage the development and testing of prototypes of these products (as necessary), and manage the products through the development lifecycle, ultimately to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, licensure and /or clearance, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration, and/or approval of the developed product, to include post marketing commitments, for use by our Service Members through the requirements defined in the DoD and Army acquisitions processes (DoD 5000 series).  Thus, the USAMMDA and USAMMA product managers are responsible for the success (including cost/schedule/ performance) of the product development effort and must manage Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) through the development and implementation of development plans (and other acquisition requirements, as applicable), to develop and field medical materiel.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA accomplish their respective missions by exercising four core capabilities:  (1) Defense Acquisition and Program Management; (2) Regulatory Affairs (FDA or EPA regulated products); (3) Medical Product Development; and, (4) Coordination of The Surgeon General's Executive Agent management of Force Health Protection's IND products.       <br>              <br>     Depending on the product development strategy, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Department of the Army, may be the regulatory sponsor.  For these product development efforts, DRAC and CSSD are the regulatory elements responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.  In these cases, DRAC and CSSD may execute FDA regulated sponsor responsibilities or delegate some or all of these responsibilities to the Prime or its subcontractor and only provide oversight of these activities. In other cases, the product development effort will include industry or academia partners who hold the regulatory Sponsorship, which may also include foreign government marketing strategies.  The DRAC and CSSD may provide oversight of regulated activities sponsored by partners, depending on the capabilities or requests of the partner.  Specific requirements will be variable and included in detail at the task order level.       <br>              <br>     Additionally, DRAC and CSSD provide regulatory affairs and medical product development support for other organizations outside of USAMMDA and USAMMA, including USAMRMC subordinate commands, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  These organizations may utilize this contract vehicle to conduct product development activities, which are being sponsored by OTSG and supported by USAMMDA DRAC and CSSD.       <br>              <br>     The CBMS Joint Project Management Office is responsible for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle management of FDA-approved medical systems for protection, treatment, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents.  All CBRN medical countermeasures are approved by and regulated through the FDA.  The CBMS continues to aggressively explore opportunities to partner with other government agencies, industry, academia, and allied countries for all CBRN medical countermeasure efforts.  The CBMS product portfolio includes products spanning the entire acquisition life cycle.         <br>            <br>     Objective:       <br>              <br>     The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the US Army's medical materiel development program by providing a mechanism for all aspects of medical product/device development and life cycle support, including project management, technical expertise/assistance, strategic planning, market analysis, training, administrative activities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing, assay validation, validated storage and shipment, non-clinical testing, clinical research (to include monitoring, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, full data management, and biostatistical support), regulatory writing and submission support, regulatory strategy and consultation, quality, integrated logistics support, equipment maintenance support and information technology in support of each task order.  For example:  a task order may specify that a contractor will conduct clinical trials worldwide (inclusive of pre-trial activities, trial activities and post trial activities),  provide product managers with support services to assist/provide technical guidance and provide independent and objective reviews, site feasibility assessments, prepare and assemble both generic and product-specific US FDA and EPA related documentation, take meeting minutes, provide complete clinical monitoring support including compilation of Sponsor trial master files, provide a data management system , preferably an electronic data capture (EDC) system, compliant with FDA/ICH regulations and guidance, data management, biostatistical evaluation and data analysis, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, and complete a final clinical study report compliant with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and/or FDA regulations and guidance.        <br>              <br>     Period of Performance:        <br>              <br>     The Period of Performance for this contract will be a five year base period with five one-year option periods.        <br>              <br>     Response:        <br>              <br>     This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this presolicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this presolicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.  Potential offerors are directed to respond to the Solicitation when it is released on this website under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.        <br>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
4-3-2013

The purpose of this solicitation is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil , mechanical,  electrical,  geotechnical, environmental, etc, as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for the Seed Projects for each station are:

Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M

18.	I am interested in teaming with a SDVOSB firm for work under these projects can you provide a list of SDVOSB firms that I may contact for this purpose?

All interested parties including SDVOSB Prime contractors are listed on the Interested Parties list at www.fbo.gov.  It's at the top of the screen when you search on the project.  You can also go to www.vetbiz.gov and search on the NAICS code 541310 and pull a list of SDVOSB firms.

I do not keep a bid list or SDVOSB list of vendors. 

19.	Would an Adobe PDF be acceptable format for submission?

A PDF file is preferred and acceptable for submission.

20.	If so what size file can you accept?

File size cannot exceed 5M due to restrictions on my email.  I am unable to accept larger than 5M.

21.	Section 4 (a) is not applicable to A&E since we do not perform construction and do not have an EMR.

Correct.

22.	What would you consider the general geographic area? For example our office is located in Denver but we do work all over the west. 

This is asking for the general locations of your offices.  There is no geographical restriction on these projects.  This is asking for your office location and provide any experience in the area of the station you are submitting the proposal for.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).  

c.	Title II (Type "C" Services):  Those items involving inspecting, monitoring, commissioning and evaluating construction activities to validate conformance to plans and specifications.  These services include reviewing, evaluating and testing product submittals and shop drawing and preparation of construction contract modifications.

d.	Applicable Standards, Manuals, and Directives:  The A/E shall prepare all design documents in conformance with the applicable portions of the following:

1) VHA Standard Format (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dManual.asp).

2) Applicable VHA Directives, Instructions, Pamphlets, Manuals or other documents as directed by the VISN-19 Station Engineer or Chief of Design.  

Note - The VA has a series of design guides and space planning tools in addition to VA Master Specifications.  These will generally be minimum standards but may be adjusted to meet other requirements such as energy and environmental compliance.   Modifications are to be approved by the VA.

3) Current state and national codes, regulations, and specifications involving architectural, civil, electrical, environmental, and mechanical disciplines associated with the design and construction of each project as referenced by VHA or CO direction.

4) Public Laws and Executive Orders with specific reference to EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, Environmental Policy, EO 13423, EO 13514, etc.  

Note - Environmental impacts must be evaluated and either meet categorical exclusion or have a full environmental assessment performed.   Many VA buildings are considered historic and this will need to be considered throughout the design.  Reference sources are available upon request by either websites or government furnished.

e. Guide Specifications:  The A/E shall use VHA guide specifications (section 2.c) as the basis for producing specifications under this contract.  The specifications shall be tailored to suit the specific work requirements of the individual items contained in the TO.  Extraneous material that does not apply shall be deleted.  An overall table of contents will be provided for all design specifications utilized for each project design accomplished.  While the A/E should cover relevant items in full scope to assure quality construction and compliance, the use of notes on the drawings either to accentuate important items in the specifications, or to take the place of lengthy written specifications for routine or simple items is encouraged.  Entire specifications for simple projects of low monetary value may be by notes on the drawings.  The A/E is permitted to use specific manufacturer's part or model numbers to describe a specified item, however, in all such cases, at least two other approved manufacturer's part or model numbers shall be specified in an "or equal" statement which shall be included unless the government wishes to sole source an item.  

f. Economic Studies:  In preparing designs the A/E shall make a comparative cost analysis to justify the selection of type and source of utilities, major items of equipment, building components, materials, method of construction, siting, plumbing, lighting, heating, air conditioning, building configuration, electrical systems, column spacing, roads, story heights, structural system, and selection of interior and exterior finishes.  The analysis will include cost of operation and maintenance over the expected life of the project.  This cost analysis shall include consideration of the life cycle cost of the facility.  Major decisions shall be documented in the design analysis.

g. Simplified Design:  The use of simplified design techniques is encouraged in routine, simple projects and/or those of low monetary values.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
April 4, 2013

The purpose of this modification is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, environmental, etc., as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for the Seed Projects for each station are:

Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M

18.	I am interested in teaming with a SDVOSB firm for work under these projects can you provide a list of SDVOSB firms that I may contact for this purpose?

All interested parties including SDVOSB Prime contractors are listed on the Interested Parties list at www.fbo.gov.  It's at the top of the screen when you search on the project.  You can also go to www.vetbiz.gov and search on the NAICS code 541310 and pull a list of SDVOSB firms.

I do not keep a bid list or SDVOSB list of vendors. 

19.	Would an Adobe PDF be acceptable format for submission?

A PDF file is preferred and acceptable for submission.

20.	If so what size file can you accept?

File size cannot exceed 5M due to restrictions on my email.  I am unable to accept larger than 5M.

21.	Section 4 (a) is not applicable to A&E since we do not perform construction and do not have an EMR.

Correct.

22.	What would you consider the general geographic area? For example our office is located in Denver but we do work all over the west. 

This is asking for the general locations of your offices.  There is no geographical restriction on these projects.  This is asking for your office location and provide any experience in the area of the station you are submitting the proposal for.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).  

c.	Title II (Type "C" Services):  Those items involving inspecting, monitoring, commissioning and evaluating construction activities to validate conformance to plans and specifications.  These services include reviewing, evaluating and testing product submittals and shop drawing and preparation of construction contract modifications.

d.	Applicable Standards, Manuals, and Directives:  The A/E shall prepare all design documents in conformance with the applicable portions of the following:

1) VHA Standard Format (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dManual.asp).

2) Applicable VHA Directives, Instructions, Pamphlets, Manuals or other documents as directed by the VISN-19 Station Engineer or Chief of Design.  

Note - The VA has a series of design guides and space planning tools in addition to VA Master Specifications.  These will generally be minimum standards but may be adjusted to meet other requirements such as energy and environmental compliance.   Modifications are to be approved by the VA.

3) Current state and national codes, regulations, and specifications involving architectural, civil, electrical, environmental, and mechanical disciplines associated with the design and construction of each project as referenced by VHA or CO direction.

4) Public Laws and Executive Orders with specific reference to EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, Environmental Policy, EO 13423, EO 13514, etc.  

Note - Environmental impacts must be evaluated and either meet categorical exclusion or have a full environmental assessment performed.   Many VA buildings are considered historic and this will need to be considered throughout the design.  Reference sources are available upon request by either websites or government furnished.

e. Guide Specifications:  The A/E shall use VHA guide specifications (section 2.c) as the basis for producing specifications under this contract.  The specifications shall be tailored to suit the specific work requirements of the individual items contained in the TO.  Extraneous material that does not apply shall be deleted.  An overall table of contents will be provided for all design specifications utilized for each project design accomplished.  While the A/E should cover relevant items in full scope to assure quality construction and compliance, the use of notes on the drawings either to accentuate important items in the specifications, or to take the place of lengthy written specifications for routine or simple items is encouraged.  Entire specifications for simple projects of low monetary value may be by notes on the drawings.  The A/E is permitted to use specific manufacturer's part or model numbers to describe a specified item, however, in all such cases, at least two other approved manufacturer's part or model numbers shall be specified in an "or equal" statement which shall be included unless the government wishes to sole source an item.  

f. Economic Studies:  In preparing designs the A/E shall make a comparative cost analysis to justify the selection of type and source of utilities, major items of equipment, building components, materials, method of construction, siting, plumbing, lighting, heating, air conditioning, building configuration, electrical systems, column spacing, roads, story heights, structural system, and selection of interior and exterior finishes.  The analysis will include cost of operation and maintenance over the expected life of the project.  This cost analysis shall include consideration of the life cycle cost of the facility.  Major decisions shall be documented in the design analysis.

g. Simplified Design:  The use of simplified design techniques is encouraged in routine, simple projects and/or those of low monetary values.

The purpose of this solicitation is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil , mechanical,  electrical,  geotechnical, environmental, etc, as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000

Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for the Seed Projects for each station are:

Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M

18.	I am interested in teaming with a SDVOSB firm for work under these projects can you provide a list of SDVOSB firms that I may contact for this purpose?

All interested parties including SDVOSB Prime contractors are listed on the Interested Parties list at www.fbo.gov.  It's at the top of the screen when you search on the project.  You can also go to www.vetbiz.gov and search on the NAICS code 541310 and pull a list of SDVOSB firms.

I do not keep a bid list or SDVOSB list of vendors. 

19.	Would an Adobe PDF be acceptable format for submission?

A PDF file is preferred and acceptable for submission.

20.	If so what size file can you accept?

File size cannot exceed 5M due to restrictions on my email.  I am unable to accept larger than 5M.

21.	Section 4 (a) is not applicable to A&E since we do not perform construction and do not have an EMR.

Correct.

22.	What would you consider the general geographic area? For example our office is located in Denver but we do work all over the west. 

This is asking for the general locations of your offices.  There is no geographical restriction on these projects.  This is asking for your office location and provide any experience in the area of the station you are submitting the proposal for.

d.	Construction Time:  The A/E shall provide a recommended construction performance period for the complete and useable project.  Recommendations will be based on the designer's experience, knowledge of the industry, local market forces, weather conditions and availability of resources.  Specific references shall be made to equipment/material items that may have a long lead item, and could pose a problem to the performance period.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.  This requires up front analysis and planning.  This indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract will be for one basic period of year (12 months), with 4 option years (12 months each).  

c.	Title II (Type "C" Services):  Those items involving inspecting, monitoring, commissioning and evaluating construction activities to validate conformance to plans and specifications.  These services include reviewing, evaluating and testing product submittals and shop drawing and preparation of construction contract modifications.

d.	Applicable Standards, Manuals, and Directives:  The A/E shall prepare all design documents in conformance with the applicable portions of the following:

1) VHA Standard Format (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/dManual.asp).

2) Applicable VHA Directives, Instructions, Pamphlets, Manuals or other documents as directed by the VISN-19 Station Engineer or Chief of Design.  

Note - The VA has a series of design guides and space planning tools in addition to VA Master Specifications.  These will generally be minimum standards but may be adjusted to meet other requirements such as energy and environmental compliance.   Modifications are to be approved by the VA.

3) Current state and national codes, regulations, and specifications involving architectural, civil, electrical, environmental, and mechanical disciplines associated with the design and construction of each project as referenced by VHA or CO direction.

4) Public Laws and Executive Orders with specific reference to EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, Environmental Policy, EO 13423, EO 13514, etc.  

Note - Environmental impacts must be evaluated and either meet categorical exclusion or have a full environmental assessment performed.   Many VA buildings are considered historic and this will need to be considered throughout the design.  Reference sources are available upon request by either websites or government furnished.

e. Guide Specifications:  The A/E shall use VHA guide specifications (section 2.c) as the basis for producing specifications under this contract.  The specifications shall be tailored to suit the specific work requirements of the individual items contained in the TO.  Extraneous material that does not apply shall be deleted.  An overall table of contents will be provided for all design specifications utilized for each project design accomplished.  While the A/E should cover relevant items in full scope to assure quality construction and compliance, the use of notes on the drawings either to accentuate important items in the specifications, or to take the place of lengthy written specifications for routine or simple items is encouraged.  Entire specifications for simple projects of low monetary value may be by notes on the drawings.  The A/E is permitted to use specific manufacturer's part or model numbers to describe a specified item, however, in all such cases, at least two other approved manufacturer's part or model numbers shall be specified in an "or equal" statement which shall be included unless the government wishes to sole source an item.  

f. Economic Studies:  In preparing designs the A/E shall make a comparative cost analysis to justify the selection of type and source of utilities, major items of equipment, building components, materials, method of construction, siting, plumbing, lighting, heating, air conditioning, building configuration, electrical systems, column spacing, roads, story heights, structural system, and selection of interior and exterior finishes.  The analysis will include cost of operation and maintenance over the expected life of the project.  This cost analysis shall include consideration of the life cycle cost of the facility.  Major decisions shall be documented in the design analysis.

g. Simplified Design:  The use of simplified design techniques is encouraged in routine, simple projects and/or those of low monetary values.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
4-3-2013

The purpose of this solicitation is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil , mechanical,  electrical,  geotechnical, environmental, etc, as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for the Seed Projects for each station are:

Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M

18.	I am interested in teaming with a SDVOSB firm for work under these projects can you provide a list of SDVOSB firms that I may contact for this purpose?

All interested parties including SDVOSB Prime contractors are listed on the Interested Parties list at www.fbo.gov.  It's at the top of the screen when you search on the project.  You can also go to www.vetbiz.gov and search on the NAICS code 541310 and pull a list of SDVOSB firms.

I do not keep a bid list or SDVOSB list of vendors. 

19.	Would an Adobe PDF be acceptable format for submission?

A PDF file is preferred and acceptable for submission.

20.	If so what size file can you accept?

File size cannot exceed 5M due to restrictions on my email.  I am unable to accept larger than 5M.

21.	Section 4 (a) is not applicable to A&E since we do not perform construction and do not have an EMR.

Correct.

22.	What would you consider the general geographic area? For example our office is located in Denver but we do work all over the west. 

This is asking for the general locations of your offices.  There is no geographical restriction on these projects.  This is asking for your office location and provide any experience in the area of the station you are submitting the proposal for.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
April 4, 2013

The purpose of this modification is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical, environmental, etc., as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for the Seed Projects for each station are:

Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M

18.	I am interested in teaming with a SDVOSB firm for work under these projects can you provide a list of SDVOSB firms that I may contact for this purpose?

All interested parties including SDVOSB Prime contractors are listed on the Interested Parties list at www.fbo.gov.  It's at the top of the screen when you search on the project.  You can also go to www.vetbiz.gov and search on the NAICS code 541310 and pull a list of SDVOSB firms.

I do not keep a bid list or SDVOSB list of vendors. 

19.	Would an Adobe PDF be acceptable format for submission?

A PDF file is preferred and acceptable for submission.

20.	If so what size file can you accept?

File size cannot exceed 5M due to restrictions on my email.  I am unable to accept larger than 5M.

21.	Section 4 (a) is not applicable to A&E since we do not perform construction and do not have an EMR.

Correct.

22.	What would you consider the general geographic area? For example our office is located in Denver but we do work all over the west. 

This is asking for the general locations of your offices.  There is no geographical restriction on these projects.  This is asking for your office location and provide any experience in the area of the station you are submitting the proposal for.

3.  STATEMENT OF SERVICES:  The A/E shall perform all or part of the following services as more specifically identified in each delivery order.

a.	Title I (Type "A" Services).  The A/E shall perform all work required to investigate existing conditions (Pre-Design).  This work includes field investigations and surveys (topographic, geotechnical, chemical, site utilities, existing mechanical etc.), energy modeling/analysis, commissioning and similar fact finding surveys of the site in order to provide reports of existing conditions on which to base proper design; and similar services not involved in the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.

b.	Title I (Type "B") Services:  The A/E shall perform those items normally furnished by an A/E in the actual preparation of the design documents (plans, drawings, estimates, specifications, submittal register, Comprehensive Interior Design, etc.) in the Schematic, Design Development and Construction Document phases.  The A/E shall perform all work required to produce documents describing the work required to accomplish the project as specifically identified in each Task Order (TO).  Unless otherwise specifically provided therein, the A/E shall perform these services as follows.

1)	Field Survey and Investigation:  The A/E shall visually inspect the site and/or facility for familiarization with the scope of work and general conditions of the facility.  Coordinate with the using activities to obtain their operational activities for the development of functional relationships and detailed requirements.  The A/E shall visit the project site for investigation of the existing physical conditions and to ensure the accuracy of the drawings, as available, furnished to the A/E by the Government.

2)	Cost Estimates:  The A/E shall design each project to provide a complete and usable facility within a given target construction cost provided by the Government.  The target construction cost will be provided to the contractor in our requests for proposal and on the executed contractual document, the Standard Form 252.  The A/E cost estimates shall be based on labor and material prices prevailing in the project's locality.  Cost estimates shall be descriptive, detailed, and includes all operations of work required including quantities and unit costs.  Additionally the construction cost estimate shall include Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment when applicable.  The A/E cost estimate shall summarize all cost by material, labor, other direct costs, overhead, profit, and bonding costs.  Cost estimates shall be prepared on an electronic version of the VA Form 08-6277, RS Means Standard Excel Format or CO pre-approved A/E equivalent electronic spreadsheet that provides the information specified above.

3)	Project Costs:  The A/E shall be required to conduct the field survey and investigations, prepare the preliminary drawings, data, reports, etc., and design the full scope of the work as outlined above and as agreed upon during review of study data and recommendations.  If the estimated costs exceeds the amount indicated on the project description sheets for each project (based on current anticipated scope and subject to adjustment to approved scope), sufficient alternates to the construction contract should be determined at the time of the preliminary review conference to reduce the cost below this amount, if deemed necessary by the Government.  Cost estimates, and computation sheets prepared by the A/E shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY".

4)	Phasing Plans, Impact Mitigation, and Energy.  Construction work will be in occupied Medical Centers and every effort will be made to interface construction with Medical Center operations. To minimize impact this means the preparation of detailed phasing plans including associated moves.  Phasing plans will show exact areas of work along with specific outage times, infection control risk assessment (ICRA) mitigation measures (including specific dust, noise, debris control), interim life safety measures (ILSM) which provide for specific measures to mitigate any reduction in fire protection features (i.e., exits out of service, fire sprinkler removal, etc).  Utility outages will be carefully planned and included it the contract in order to allow all OSHA required safety measures to be maintained while continuing Medical Center operations.  (For example, outages must provide means to shut off and lock out / tag out equipment while still allowing for Medical Center to continue operations).  Project must meet all legal requirements and executive orders including EPAC 2005, EISA 2007, EO 13514, and EO13423 all dealing with environmental, energy, and water as specifically applied to Federal Buildings.

4-3-2013

The purpose of this solicitation is to pass on questions and answers received on this project.

1.	In addition to a prime architecture firm, do you anticipate engineering/consultant services for structural, civil , mechanical,  electrical,  geotechnical, environmental, etc, as well, and should they be included in the Form 330 submittal?

Yes - we anticipate the use of all disciplines under the A/E IDIQs.

2.	Is this pre-solicitation for just one IDIQ contract?

The VA anticipates awarding two contracts under each solicitation.  A total of 12 contracts.

3.	How many firms will be shortlisted to go on to the "Seed Task Order" submittal phase?

The evaluation board will provide me with the top three firms after interviews.  I will work with the two highest technically rated firms for a price proposal on the seed project.   The best value price will be awarded the seed project.  The second firm will be awarded an A/E IDIQ project without the seed project.  This is the process for all the solicitations.

4.	Do I need to submit anything for the seed project under this pre-solicitation?

The seed projects at this point are for information only.  The highest technically rated firms will be provided the SOW for the seed project and be asked to submit a price proposal for the seed project.  At this time the Seed Project is information only but it is a project we plan on awarding under the IDIQ.

The only requirement is for SF330s only. 

5.	Your solicitation states that commissioning will be needed.  I would be interested in this work.  Do I submit a proposal for commissioning?

No - this solicitation is for the A/E IDIQ awards only.  The commissioning will be solicited to SDVOSB firms on GSA contract. 

6.	The second paragraph indicates the VA "is seeking professional architect/engineering firms" in the first sentence. The second sentence references "..an IDIQ contract" will be awarded. Is the VA seeking to award IDIQ contracts to multiple A/E firms or a select a single A/E firm?
 
The VA intends to award two contracts per solicitation.
 
7.	We are unable to locate a maximum or minimum expected contract amount in the notice. Does the VA have expected maximum or minimum contract values?

The magnitude of the IDIQs are between $1M and $5M.  These being IDIQ contracts each project placed against the IDIQ will have a different magnitude.   Project magnitudes for each station are:
 
Cheyenne - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Denver - Less than $25,000
Grand Junction - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Montana - Between $100,000 and $250,000
Salt Lake City - Between $250,000 and $500,000
Sheridan - Between $500,000 and $1M
 
8.	Will interested A/E design the seed project during the selection process?

The only thing required of interested parties is the submission of an SF330 at this time.  No design is requested.
 
9.	Will more than one A/E firm work on the seed project? If so, how many?
 
Two firms will be awarded an A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years.  Only one firm will get the award for the seed project.  Only one firm will work the seed project.  The seed project information was for information only indicating that we do have a project that we want to award now.
 
10.	If A/E firm(s) work on the seed project during procurement, will there be a stipend associated with the effort?
 
N/A See above.
 
11.	If the seed project is part of the selection process, what are the selection criteria associated with it?
 
No selection criteria for the seed project it will be awarded under one IDIQ and the evaluation criteria used in the solicitation is the only evaluation criteria used.

12.	My firm is verified w/CVE and has been enrolled in CCR but it is my understanding that the System for Award Management (SAM) is the current system.  Will you recognize SAM in lieu of CCR?
 
CCR is no longer.  When you try to access CCR on the internet you are taken to SAM.  SAM has migrated all information from CCR.  SAM is the system recognized by all federal agencies.

 
13.	Is an overall procurement schedule available? 
 
No - no schedule is available.  The awardee of the seed project will provide a schedule as appropriate.
 
14.	It would be helpful for us to know any procurement milestones and a best guess for any dates after initial SF330s are submitted.
 
Any date I give you here is my best guess.   My best guess would be award by 
June 30, 2013.
 
15.	Will the VA only award one contract under this solicitation?
The VA intends to award two A/E IDIQs per station.  Twelve contracts in all.  
16.	Could you please further define the general geographic area requirements for the Prime and or Subs for this solicitation?

Evaluation criteria #5 is asking where your firm is located and your knowledge of the location that services are required.  There is no geographical limitation on these projects.  The general geographical area is the area of the project i.e., Cheyenne, Wyoming, Denver, Colorado and Salt Lake City, Utah.

17.	Please verify the magnitude of these projects and also verify if these projects are set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.  

These projects are set aside for SDVOSB concerns.  I will be awarding two contracts per solicitation.  The magnitude of the A/E IDIQ for a base and 4 option years are between $1M and $5M.

2.  This requirement will be accomplished via:

[X] New Purchase Order

[   ] Modification No. 

[   ] Purchase Card 


Purchase Order will be:

[X] Firm Fixed Price			[   ] Cost Type Contract:

[   ] Time and Materials		[   ]  Other (Specify):  

Type of Funds (e.g.  Supply Fund, Franchise Fund, IT, etc.):

[ X ]  IT

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:

 [ X  ] Supplies

Item name: Quantum Scalar i6000 Maintenance and Technical Support.

Part of or used with: Quantum Scalar i6000 Tape Library System.

Quantity being procured: One Quantum Scalar i6000 Gold Support Plan for a Quantum Scalar i6000 with 100 ports, one Quantum Scalar i6000 Gold Support Plan for a Quantum Scalar i6000 with an additional 100 slots, and six Quantum Scalar i6000 Gold Support Plans for Quantum Scalar i6000 Drives.

Estimated unit cost:  REDACTED

Estimated total cost: REDACTED

4.  Authority Cited:

[   ]  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)
.
[ X ]  Other FAR Authority: The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized".
	
5.  Reason for Authority Cited:

[ X ] Explain need for brand name: Based on market research, as described in paragraph eight of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers for the aforementioned maintenance and technical support.  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Only Quantum, or an authorized reseller, has the proprietary rights to provide the required maintenance and technical support for the existing Quantum i6000 Tape Library System used by VA, Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Enterprise System Engineering (ESE), Health Solutions.  The subject maintenance and technical support, from Quantum, or an authorized reseller, will provide for the manufacturer's website resources, four-hour response time for on-site troubleshooting, firmware upgrades, concurrent maintenance, and remote monitoring.  ESE previously purchased and is using the Quantum i6000 Tape Library System which protects against data loss, provides disaster recovery options, and fulfills legal requirements for the retention of email records.  This system is also used to fulfill the obligations of the litigation hold order placed on VA Central Office Exchange data and also contains all VA litigation information from the Office of General Counsel.  This maintenance and technical support is critical to the continued functionality of the Quantum i6000 Tape Library System for VA data storage.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: 

Quantum, or authorized resellers, are the only sources that can meet the requirements for the reasons given above. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name item on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  Procurement data does not include any unnecessary requirements that may inhibit competition.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:

Although the Government is limiting competition as a result of specifying a specific brand name, there are 33 authorized resellers of Quantum maintenance and technical support products on the NASA SEWP IV GWAC.  In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(6), the proposed contract action is exempt from synopsizing as it is an order placed under FAR Subpart 16.5. The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.

8.	Market Research:

REDACTED

9.  Interested Sources:

[ X ] No other source has expressed written interest in supplying this item.

<DESC>The attached Justification and Approval is conducted under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed action will be awarded as a modification to FA4417-12-C-0023 firm fixed price, construction contract.&nbsp; The work to be performed includes, but is not limited to, the following principal features: Replace existing air handling unit and modify the system controls. The air handling unit feeds conditioned outside air to the hangar bay for the purpose of purging aircraft fuel tanks. The current air handling unit is undersized and the controls only allow purging of one wing/fuel tank at a time. The new air handling unit and controls will allow purging of both wings/fuel tanks simultaneously. The period of performance for this effort will be approximately 64 days from award and FY14 appropriations will fund this effort.&nbsp; See the attached Justification and Approval for more information
