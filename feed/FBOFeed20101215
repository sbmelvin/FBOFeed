<SOLNBR>CFMO-11-SO-0081
<RESPDATE>123010
<CONTACT>William M Roberson, Phone 202-418-5367, Fax 202-418-5414, Email wroberson@cftc.gov
<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC" or "Commission") intends to procure the services of Harvey Theberge, on a sole source basis, for advisory and assistance services in connection with the operation and expansion of the Commission's new Market Continuity program required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Act"). The services of the contractor will also be used for the development and enhancement of the technical aspects of the soon to be re-proposed Co-Location/Proximity Hosting Services Rule. Automated systems play a central and critical role in the modern, predominantly electronic, futures trading environment. They will also play a critical role in the swaps market which the Commission has been charged to regulate by the Act. Oversight of system safeguards therefore is central to the mission of the Commission. Additionally, the explosive growth of "high frequency" and "algorithmic" trading in recent years has placed premiums on outright transaction processing speed, and led to extensive use of co-location and proximity hosting services. The Commission believes that these services should be offered and administered in an equitable, fair, and transparent manner, and has proposed a series of requirements for all exchanges and trading markets that offer them. The requirement for latency transparency included in this proposal is novel, esoteric, and requires specialized experience in the areas of networking, computer operations, and systems processing. The contractor is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform the required work. During the past two and one-half years, the contractor has played a principal role in developing the Commission's new Market Continuity program, which is designed to conduct regular reviews of compliance with system safeguards core principles and regulations for the automated systems of not only designated contract markets ("DCMs") and derivatives clearing organizations ("DCOs"), but also the swaps execution facilities ("SEFs") and swap data repositories ("SDRs") created pursuant to the Act. The contractor has also played a central role in assisting the Commission in developing possible requirements for exchanges that offer co-location and/or proximity hosting services, particularly in the area of latency transparency, and has devoted a significant amount of time and effort in building expertise in this area through research and discussion with major industry participants and providers. Additionally, the contractor developed the Commission's existing program for conducting technical reviews of applicants for designation as an exchange. He was also the sole provider of reviews of the systems planned by new applicants for designation, and has regularly acted as a consultant to CFTC attorneys on technical matters in rule enforcement reviews for the past 10 years. Due to the unique qualifications of Harvey Theberge, and the results of past related notices posted in FedBizOpps, CFTC believes that no other qualified source exists for this work. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers and, as such, no solicitation is available. However, the Government will consider responses from all responsible sources received by the response date and time identified in this synopsis. Written responses must include sufficient information to establish capability to fulfill the requirement. Any responses received will only be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in lieu of the sole source contract described in this notice, and such determination shall be made at the sole discretion of CFTC.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals describing the science &amp; technology development necessary to enable future expeditionary deployment of renewable-based 3 kW power systems. Conceptual development and advanced technology demonstration are of interest to transition technology from TRL 3 to TRL 6. This Renewable Sustainable Expeditionary Power (RSEP) technology will be key to meeting future US Marine Corps Forward-Deployed Enhanced Company Operations needs and future USMC and DoD platform power needs well into the future.
<p>It is envisioned that RSEP concepts will employ sustainable energy strategies, energy storage, and liquid fuels, in a hybrid concept, to generate power for expeditionary operations. Fuel-to-electric energy conversion will accept both military logistics fuels and biofuel blends. Utilization of renewable and sustainable energy for power generation in expeditionary settings is expected to reduce fuel usage by more than 40% over existing, comparable size DoD power systems. Proposed technology developments should enable operational improvements in the following areas at a minimum: <br />- Fuel consumption<br />- Noise levels<br />- Cost of ownership<br />- Maintainability<br />- Deployability</p>

Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Portland International (PDX) Airport9.	Pittsburgh International (PIT) Airport

<DESC>The U.S. Forest Service is contemplating the issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the near future for the purchase and maintenance of Operational Loads Monitoring System (OLMS) equipment. Any new equipment installations will be on Contractor and Government-owned aircraft. Maintenance of Operational Loads Monitoring System (OLMS) equipment will be on 31 previously installed, Government owned, OLM systems manufactured by Appareo Systems built around their GAU2000 acquisition unit (http://www.appareo.com/products/usfs.php). These aircraft are involved in aerial firefighting and have been instrumented for the purpose of determining aerodynamic operational loads experienced within the low level fire suppression environment. The purpose of this interest announcement is to obtain market research on interested vendors and the business size standards of the interested vendors.
<p>During fire fighting operations, the workload for both the air and ground crew are quite intense. Therefore, the recording system installed on these aircraft must rely on minimal intervention by the flight and/or ground crews for data acquisition, supplemental data collection and merging and finally the data transfer to the Forest Service contracted server on which the Library Database resides.</p>
<p>Operational Loads Monitoring System (OLMS) Requirements. A OLMS is comprised of all equipment required for recording, signal conditioning, sensors, transducers, wire harnesses, installation hardware and data extraction (download/ upload) equipment required to acquire, record and transmit variations in required parameters (Table 1) as experienced by a firefighting aircraft during flight and ground operations in accordance with the parameters from Table 1 as attached in FedBizOps.</p>

THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.
  

NSWCCD Philadelphia is currently looking for sources that can design, furnish and test motor-operated pilot valves (MOPV) as a replacement for the solenoid-operated pilot valves (SOPV) currently used aboard U.S. Navy ships. The MOPV shall be a 4-port valve with capability to function as a 3-port valve.  The 4-port master MOPV will be used to initiate Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) concentrate flow via the control of seawater flow to/from diaphragm operated valves and fire-main flow for mixing and disbursement to AFFF systems aboard ship. The 3-port MOPV serves as the local disbursement valve for either fire-main flow or the AFFF mixture via the control of seawater flow to/from diaphragm operated valves.
  The valve is subject to long periods during which it is not operated, up to several months, after which it may cycle several times in a day, and then be static again for several months. The seawater being controlled by the valve is from the ships fire-main (normally 150 to 175 lb/in2) and contains substantial contaminants due to the coarse strainers used in these systems. The MOPV is subject to the preference for domestic specialty metals, 48 CFR 252.225-7014.  Materials used in the construction of the valve, actuator, and associated equipment shall be corrosion resistant materials suitable for use in a seawater environments. 

The notice of interest should include as a minimum:
- Summary of Technical Capabilities and Experience relate to valve and/or mechanical device design and manufacture.
 
- Description of Facilities, Personnel, and Manufacturing/Testing Capabilities including Subcontracting Arrangements.
-  Minimum production quantity and Maximum yearly production.
- Past performance manufacturing the requested item or similar items.

 If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. 

The government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract.
 

BASED ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/MARKET RESEARCH, THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. Telephone inquires will not be accepted and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.

<DESC>The Enterprise Acquisition Contracting Division (ASC/PKEIS, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7228) intends to award a bridge contract, FA8604-11-C-7450, to allow continued support for the current AFRL Rapid Response IT Support contract. This bridging effort will have a period of performance of five months, from 18 Dec 10 to 18 May 11, and will allow continued program support until Solicitation FA8604-10-R-7479 is competitively awarded.
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The proposed contract action is for work which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B) "Unacceptable Delays." Contract DAAB07-03-D-B006 was competitively awarded to ARINC in September 2006. This contract action will allow for the continued support of mission critical functions until a follow-on contract is awarded.</p>
<p>ARINC is currently the incumbent for the AFRL Rapid Reaction IT Support contract. AFRL/RYZ requires the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, and reception of sensor data and/or information. Support needed to accomplish the above "handling" of the data and/or information include the following: identifying and resolving program management, financial analysis, engineering, and logistics issues for IT-based development programs and associated equipment. The type of technical tasks this effort shall employ to accomplish the overall requirements of "data-handling" includes analysis, design, research, development, prototyping, fabrication, integration, test, and repair of equipment, as well as research, development and delivery of engineering and logistics support required for AFRL/RYZ program activities. To accomplish the mission, the supplier of the support must employ and utilize personnel with the proper expertise and experience in each of the disciplines to assure success and Customer (ASC, ACC, SOF, USSOCOM, JIEDDO, DARPA, USA, USMC, USN, AFRC, ANG) satisfaction of the product delivered to the warfighter. ARINC has superior support knowledge of the system, and thus is the only contractor capable of providing the support described above without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in accomplishing its mission. To enhance competition, the follow-on contract will provide a transition period if a new contractor is competitively selected, which will mitigate program risks.</p>
<p>Any questions or concerns about this award notice should first be directed to the buyer, Jake Hutchinson, at jacob.hutchinson@wpafb.af.mil, or you may contact the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>(a) Mr Howard E. Marks Jr., ASC/AQH, has been appointed as Ombudsman. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendation to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>

<DESC>The 6th Contracting Squadron (6 CONS) at MacDill AFB intends to issue a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase agreement to Dominion Federal (a small business). The vendor shall provide monthly lease and maintenance of permanent office facilities at United States Central Command (CENTCOM) using other than full and open competition procedures pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
<p>Dominion Federal is the only responsible source. This action is required to retain and maintain existing critical/mission essential work space that was constructed to directly support the Iraq War effort beginning in 2006. Because those efforts have now been re-directed to support troops in the continuing war against terrorism in Afghanistan, this facility is required for an additional unknown period of time. This 72,000 square foot modular office complex was constructed and configured to the specialized needs of the end-user. Costs are not expected to be recouped through re-competion of this requirement. Therefore, negotiations with the owner of the 91 modular units which make up this mission critical complex/facility is in the best interest of the Government. The period of performance for this purchase order will include a 2-month base period and two 1-month option periods.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted using various methods to include: Internet searches and telephone inquiries. No vendor expressed interest in participating in the requirement. The Government intends to award a one-time purchase agreement to vendor specified above. The North American Industry Classification System is 531120 and the size standard is 7 million. "This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in proposal preparation. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to a previous notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The 6th Contracting Squadron will post this notice until 1:00 pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) 30 November 2010 and intends to award purchase agreement after expiration of this notice. Note: No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.</p>

<RESPDATE>010311
<CONTACT>Seena Mathews, Phone 3014353814, Email mathewss@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate a 5 year extension to the contract with Fundacion Inciensa to continue follow-up of women enrolled in studies regarding HPV infection and cervical neoplasia among vaccinated and unvaccinated women. The planned extension will provide invaluable data that will allow for the continued investigation into the risks and benefits of the prophylactic HPV vaccine.</p>
<p>The requirements of this extension will permit DCEG/NCI to evaluate the long-term vaccine effects and will enable evaluation of numerous questions regarding HPV vaccine immunology and the epidemiology of HPV and associated disease that cannot adequately be addressed in the first 4 years of follow-up or that can be addressed with increased power by increasing follow-up time. Follow-up will allow for the evaluation of the HPV-16/18 vaccine among women through their early to mid-30s, therefore extending follow-up through the peak years of pre-cancer diagnosis among well-screened women. A more comprehensive evaluation of vaccine impact will therefore be possible, and larger numbers of pre-cancer outcomes (particularly pre-cancers caused by HPV types other than HPV-16/18) will be accrued for the various analyses envisioned.</p>
<p>Fundacion Inciensa will follow vaccinated and unvaccinated women enrolled in the NCI sponsored HPV-16/18 vaccine trial and associated studies (totaling close to 10,000 women) with state-of-the-art screening during the extended follow-up period. Fundacion Inciensa will continue to perform the above requirements to complete these studies with no disruption in service.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Fundacion Inciensa is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance over this period of time and is the only source that can provide the services for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) The contractor has unique access to this population. This procurement is designed to follow a group of women previously enrolled in the CVT study. The Contractor has been following this group since 2004. The population has been cooperative and willing to participate in long-term follow-up studies.</p>
<p>2) The contractor is a large research center dedicated to HPV and cervical cancer research. It has specialized staff and personnel; including epidemiologists, clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, microbiologists, molecular biologists and statisticians; with ample experience in conducting complex epidemiologic studies and clinical trials under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and with extensive quality assurance. With a new contractor, new staff would need to be hired and trained with unavoidable learning curve inefficiencies as well as training costs.</p>
<p>3) Fundacion Inciensa has been heavily involved in the planning of several ongoing studies and is crucial to the performance of the tasks. The time required to gain this experience by a new contractor would lead to extensive time delays and lost opportunities.</p>
<p>The support by Funadcion Inceinsa is important and should produce results of benefit to people in both the United States and Costa Rica. By understanding the efficacy of vaccines designed to protect against HPV, strategies aimed at the prevention of the infection and its serious cancer outcomes can be based on solid scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to continue with one source under authority FAR 6.302. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability&nbsp;by submitting a capability statement (5 page limit) before or on the response date.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Overnight deliveries should be mailed to Seena Mathews at the National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Suite 600, MSC 7192 Bethesda, Maryland 20852. No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted. Respondents may also submit their capability statements via email.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Intramural Research Program (IRP) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with BioVision Technologies, Inc 64 E. UWCHLAN AVENUE Exton, PA 19341.   National Institutes on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Division of Intramural Research in Baltimore, Maryland .  The imaging system is needed for the image analyses of molecular changes after exposure to addictive drugs as assessed in our rat model.  The Biovision software and associated hardware will be used to control a Carl Zeiss microscope, capture images, and analyze the images. The software was chosen to be compatible with our existing microscope and imaging software. The number of users for our existing microscope imaging system greatly exceeds its capacity. We have to purchase a complementary system to handle the necessary throughput of research in our lab. Each specific line item in the Carl  Zeiss quote has been thoroughly considered and found necessary for proper functioning of the imaging system and compatibility with the our existing software. In accordance with FAR6.302-1, the supplies required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, BioVision Technologies, Inc. and no other supplier will satisfy the agency requirements.  There are no licensed systems or instruments offered by third party providers that are able to use any components of the BioVision Technologies, Inc. We have several ongoing projects that were begun using our existing BioVision software and Carl Zeiss microscope. Thus to continue our ongoing work with the minimum amount of delay or wasted resources or experimental data, we need to keep using the same Biovision company source.
The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 13 and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing notification number NIHDA2011184 must be submitted by December 30, 2010 to NIH, NIDA, IRP, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Suite 200, BRC Bldg., Rm 04A326, Baltimore, MD  21224, ATTN:  John Johnson

<DESC><strong>&nbsp; </strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'">The Naval Research Laboratory intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competitive basis with National Electrostatics Corporation (NEC) for a Single Stage Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (SSAMS). NEC invented the concept of single stage ion acceleration for accelerator mass spectrometry, otherwise known as Single Stage Accelerator Mass Spectrometry or SSAMS. They hold the patent for this technology and have not licensed its fabrication to anyone else. Only this technology enables use of either positive or negative ions for injection into the accelerator, which we require to enable full use of our Cameca IMS 6f SIMS ion source for mass spectrometry. The system must include an A single stage accelerator mass spectrometer (SSAMS) system to accept ions generated by a Cameca IMS 6f SIMS front end at NRL to perform both positive and negative ion accelerator mass spectrometry. This technique will enable molecule destruction to remove that interference from mass spectrometry. The SIMS instrument must remain at ground potential, and the SSAMS system must be designed to accept 9 keV ions produced by the SIMS ion source. The SSAMS system must provide correct both mechanical and optical coupling to existing components in hand at NRL. The output of the Cameca SIMS front end is currently transmitted through an electrostatic analyzer, a steerer, beam profile monitor, Faraday cup, Einzel lens, and bellows with 8" conflat flanges. The accelerator must provide stable 300-kV operation, so that high precision measurements can be obtained (0.5% for isotope ratios). The system must be able to bounce the energy of ions so that it can rapidly switch between measurements of different nearby masses. The system must provide automated computer operation and data collection. <br />The SSAMS system must include the following specific features: 1) It must provide a magnet for low energy mass analysis with a mass&bull;energy product of at least 2.6 MeV&bull;amu. The magnet must be electrically isolated so that electrostatic bouncing of the ion energy can be used to rapidly switch between different mass ions, and the necessary power supplies, switches, and controls must be provided to enable bouncing. A factor of two change in mass is desired. 2) It must use at least six turbomolecular pumps and appropriate backing pumps to ensure stable, clean, and reliable ultrahigh vacuum conditions throughout the SSAMS system. Vacuum gauges and isolation valves must be provided to easily operate and maintain the vacuum system, and stainless steel beam lines with metal gasket seals must be used to connect components together. 3) It must provide a stripper capability with two turbomolecular pumps to minimize leakage of stripper gas into adjacent vacuum sections. The stripper must also include a beam slit and pressure readout to properly control and quantify the amount of stripper gas in use. 4) It must include beam control and measurement components, including at least three Faraday cups, three slit assemblies, and applicable lens elements. 5) It must include a magnet for high-energy mass analysis with a mass energy product of at least 19 MeV&bull;amu, its required vacuum chamber, and a Hall probe to measure its magnetic field. 6) It must include a high-energy electrostatic analyzer to select a specific energy/charge ratio for the ion to be analyzed, and its associated power supplies and bouncing capability. 7) It must include a deflector with bouncer and vacuum chamber. 8) It must include a high voltage deck capable of supporting 300 kV isolation and the weight of all the components to be mounted on the deck. It must include all the power supplies, bouncers, isolation transformers, and a control computer to operate the deck. A desk must be provided to use the control computer. 9) All high voltage components must be shielded from operating personnel, including use of a safety screen with interlocked doors and safety grounding rods to surround the high voltage deck. 10) The price of the system shall include training in the use of the control system as well as delivery and installation of the instrument at NRL, Washington DC. 11) A full set of all written documentation customarily provided to the public with a commercial item shall be provided. This shall include users manual(s) or equivalent as well as copies of any software, and any manuals for the software included with the system, if customarily provided. This documentation shall be received by NRL with the 12 Month Design/Assembly Report (CLIN 0001AA), unless other arrangements are agreed to by the authorized Government representative. 12) The contractor shall offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice. These warranty terms must be included in the system price. The period of the warranty shall begin upon acceptance. OPTION 1: A broader range injection magnet that switches masses by bouncing electrostatically between multiple exit ports allowing for matrix beam monitoring up to a factor of 4 in mass on the high and low side of the selected trace element mass. OPTION 2: Improved beam diagnostics including separate ports for ion imaging and particle counting before injection to the SSAMS. OPTION 3: Increasing the mass&bull;energy product for the high-energy magnet to 75 MeV&bull;amu.. <br />All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm. <br /></span>

<DESC>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344 is procuring a firm-fixed price contract for providing an integrated Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) System. We intend to award this contract sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, by 20 December 2010 at 12:00 PM EST, which shall be considered. The proposed sole source is: Bruker Nano, 1239 Parkway Ave, Ewing, NJ 08628.
<p>The United States Air Force, ASC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is procuring an integrated Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) System. The required specifications for the EDS and EBSD System are as follows:</p>
<p>a. The EDS detector shall be capable of mapping at an maximum input count rate of greater than 3 million x-ray input counts per second (average output count rate greater than 1 million counts per second) with an energy resolution less than or equal to 170 eV to enable high throughput hyperspectral x-ray mapping. Also, the energy resolution at lower count rates (up to 400,000 input counts per second) shall be better than or equal to 133 eV measured for the Mn Ka line. Lastly, the EDS detector shall use electronic cooling methods (such as Peltier cooling) to eliminate the need for liquid nitrogen cooling and minimize vibrations to the scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>b. The EDS system software shall allow for collection of hyperspectral chemical data from a scanning electron microscope in point, line, and mapping modes, including fast hyperspectral mapping modes (up to 1024 x 1024 pixel maps with pixel dwell times at or above 1 microsecond) for collecting hyperspectral data. Drift correction software shall be supplied to reduce specimen drift effects during data collection. The software shall enable both qualitative and quantitative (standard and standardless) automated and user-interactive analysis of the EDS data, and shall be capable of both inputting and saving the hyperspectral data in EMSA/MAS format.</p>
<p>c. The EBSD detector shall contain a minimum of 640 x 480 pixels, and 12 bit or higher resolution camera. The system shall be capable of collecting EBSD patterns from a scanning electron microscope at the following minimum speeds: (i) 880 EBSD patterns per second using 80 x 60 pixel images to allow for high throughput crystallographic mapping (ii) 620 EBSD patterns per second using 160 x 120 pixel images to allow for improved angular resolution indexing while still allowing for high throughput mapping. The EBSD system shall be capable of storing the EBSD patterns in a lossless format directly to disk at the speeds listed above, to enable re-indexing of the data post experiment. The system shall be supplied with two extra phosphor screens for the EBSD detector.</p>
<p>d. The EBSD system software shall allow for collection of crystallographic maps and automatic indexing of the EBSD patterns using Hough transform-based methods, and indexed maps shall be exportable to text file (ASCII) format.</p>
<p>e. EDS-EBSD system shall be capable of collecting combined EDS &amp; EBSD data at speeds up to 200 points per second. In such combined mapping, the EDS data shall be capable of being stored in hyperspectral form.</p>
<p>f. Both the EBSD and EDS detectors shall be motorized and shall be capable of remote-controlled insertion and retraction from the system software.</p>
<p>g. The system shall be provided with a user-accessible Application Programming Interface (API) for creating custom scripts to enable remote control of the acquisition, storage, and transfer of either chemical or crystallographic mapping data from either the EDS or EBSD systems. Full documentation of the API shall be provided with the system.</p>
<p>h. The system shall be supplied with a PC and software for data collection and analysis. A 24" or larger LCD monitor shall be provided, and the PC shall have at multiple processors (minimum of a dual quad core), two hard drives with a minimum 500 GB capacity per drive, and a minimum of 4 GB of RAM. The system software should enable client-server operation over a Local Area Network (LAN), and should be supplied with Windows XP and MS Office Basic in addition to OEM-supplied data acquisition and control software.</p>
<p>i. The system shall be capable of communicating and operating on a Tescan Vega XMH scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>j. The system shall be provided with a warranty period for a total of 5 years that covers all parts, all labor, and service technician travel expenses, and unlimited emergency service visits.</p>
<p>k. An additional license for the system analysis software (both EDS and EBSD) shall be provided to enable data analysis on secondary computer not connected to the system hardware.</p>
<p>l. Classroom-based learning (two credits) and limited on-site instruction on the use of the integrated EDS/EBSD system shall be provided.</p>
<p>Delivery for the system shall be 6 months after receipt of order (ARO). FOB Destination. Payment Terms: Net 30 Days<br /><br />At this time no small business set-aside is expected. NAICS Code 334516, Size Standard 500 employees. <br /><br />Refer all questions and proposals concerning this combines synopsis/solicitation to Jennifer Begg, Contract Specialist, at jennifer.begg@wpafb.af.mil. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development.

<p>O. ELECTRONIC AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACCESSIBILITY (January2008)</p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.section508.gov/. The complete text of Section 508 Final provisions can be accessed at http://www.accessboard.gov/sec508/provisions.htm.<br />The Section 508 standards applicable to this contract/order are identified in the Statement of Work. The contractor must provide a written Section 508 conformance certification due at the end of each order/contract exceeding $100,000 when the order/contract duration is one year or less. If it is determined <br />By the Government that EIT products and services provided by the Contractor do not conform to the described accessibility in the Product Assessment Template, remediation of the products and/or services to the level of conformance specified in the vendor's Product Assessment Template will be the responsibility of the Contractor at its own expense. In the event of a modification(s) to the contract/order, which adds new EIT products and services or revised the type of, or specifications for, products and services the Contractor is to provide, including EIT deliverables such as electronic documents and reports, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor submit a completed HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template to assist the Government in determining that the EIT products and services support Section 508 accessibility requirements. Instructions for documenting accessibility via the HHS Section 508 Product Assessment Template may be found at http://508.hhs.gov. [(End of HHSAR 352.270-19(b)]</p>
<p>Prior to the Contracting Officer exercising an option for a subsequent performance period/additional quantity or adding increment funding for a subsequent performance period under this contract, as applicable, the Contractor must provide a Section 508 Annual Report to the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (also known as Project Officer or Contracting Officer's Representative). Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer in writing, the Contractor shall provide the cited report in accordance with the following schedule. Instructions for completing the report are available at: http://508.hhs.gov/ under the heading Vendor Information and Documents.<br />The Contractor's failure to submit a timely and properly completed report may jeopardize the Contracting Officer's exercising an option or adding incremental funding, as applicable.</p>

For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the Contractor is considered to be an employee of the agency. <br />(c)(1) "Operation of a system of records," as used in this clause, means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the system of records, including the collection, use, and dissemination of records. <br />(2) "Record," as used in this clause, means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains the person's name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint or a photograph. <br />(3) "System of records on individuals," as used in this clause, means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.</p>

The Contractor shall follow the applicable verification requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract. <br />(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees. The Contractor may elect to verify all existing employees hired after November 6, 1986, rather than just those employees assigned to the contract. The Contractor shall initiate verification for each existing employee working in the United States who was hired after November 6, 1986, within 180 calendar days of- <br />(i) Enrollment in the E-Verify program; or <br />(ii) Notification to E-Verify Operations of the Contractor's decision to exercise this option, using the contact information provided in the E-Verify program Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). <br />(5) The Contractor shall comply, for the period of performance of this contract, with the requirements of the E-Verify program MOU. <br />(i) The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate the Contractor's MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU.

Yellowstone National Park requires the repair of gill nets.  Quoted price shall include net pick-up by the contractor from Stephens Creek near Gardiner, Montana, in Yellowstone  National Park and delivery of the repaired or replacement nets to Mammoth Supply Center, Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming 82190, no more than 120 days after award of contract.
Following is a description of the requirements:

I) BACKGROUNDThe National Park Service (NPS) has an intensive lake trout removal program in place on Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park.  The main type of gear used in this effort is gill nets.  These nets suffer a great amount of wear and tear through normal use and the park currently has 112 nets in need of repair and net boxes for hauling and storing these nets.  
Lake trout, exotic to the Yellowstone region and discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994, are highly predatory and in other lakes of the West where they have been introduced, native cutthroat trout have been virtually eliminated. Since discovery of lake trout in Yellowstone Lake in 1994, biologists have removed almost 600,000 lake trout with an aggressive gill netting program.  However, increasing numbers of lake trout have been removed each year, and the native cutthroat trout have not rebounded to pre-lake trout levels.  A Science Panel convened in August 2008 to conduct a critical review of the NPS effort and recommended a significant surge in netting is immediately needed to force a decline in the lake trout population. 

II) PURPOSEThis Scope of Work has been developed in order to have 112 gill nets repaired or replaced for future use and to obtain adequate net boxes (2-4 nets per box) for the transport and storage of these nets.

III) WORK DETAILSGill nets are currently stored at Stephens Creek inside Yellowstone National Park, just outside of Gardiner, Montana 59030.  Nets are currently being stored in plastic garbage bags, one net per bag, and stowed in a covered trailer.  The successful bidder must pick up the nets at Stephens Creek in a timeframe that will allow for timely repair or replacement of the nets and delivery back to Yellowstone no more than 120 days after award of contract.  
Condition of the nets range from poor (requiring that the remaining mesh be stripped from the lead and float lines and replaced with new mesh material) to good (requiring some mesh removal with mending and replacement panels added to the nets).  In some instances, lead line will need replacing.  It is expected some (less than a quarter) of the float lines will also need to be replaced or restrung with deep-water floats.  See Table 1 below for details.  The repaired nets must be in new condition and constructed according to the specifications listed below.  In some cases, the successful offeror may want to replace the worn net with a new net.  In these instances nets should meet all specifications listed below and be 300 feet in length (mesh length).  

IV) CONTRACT TYPEThe National Park Service contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract as a result of this combined synopsis/solicitation to the offeror providing the best value to the Government.   

V) EVALUATION FACTORSa) Price;b) Past Performance:   Please provide three references, including name of company, name of company contact, phone number and email address for companies you have conducted similar services for as described in this solicitation.

VI) TIMELINENets are currently available for pick-up by the successful offeror.  Overall quotation shall include the cost to repair or replace nets, net boxes (2-4 nets per box) and the cost of pick-up and delivery of the nets to Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming 82190, no more than 120 days after award of contract.

VII) GILLNET SPECIFICATIONSa) Lead Line  All nets have been constructed with either 30-lb lead core line or line with external lead weights.  All external lead lines will be replaced with 30-lb lead core line. Any new or replacement lead lines will also be constructed with 30-lb lead core line.  In cases where lead lines require splicing, all splicing must be finished with no rough edges so as to prevent meshes from catching.b) Float Line  Nylon,  poly foam float, or  polypropylene lines (e.g. Starbrite or Grass meter), constructed with plastic deep water corks.  Current condition of the float lines on these nets is poor to good due to wear and tear from normal use and occasional excessive stretching of the line when improperly retrieved.  Lines should be replaced if not in good condition with  polypropylene lines.  In instances where deep water corks are not present, they must be added.  As with the lead lines, all splicing must be finished with no rough edges so as to prevent meshes from catching.c) Bridle Construction  same as float line (either  poly foam float line or  polypropylene) with short phrases (9 in or less) to minimize tear out and twisting.  To facilitate efficient and simple means of ganging multiple nets, bridles must have ears (looped float and lead lines) at each end.d) Net Length  current net lengths range from 215 to 330 ft (average is 285 ft).  In cases where nets are replaced, new nets should measure 300 ft in length (mesh length).  Nets substantially shorter than 300 ft should have additional lines and mesh added to bring it up to 300 ft.  Net length should be written on each net as it is mended.  e) Mesh Twine Size  all mesh should be constructed with size 69 twinef)  Seaming Twine  9 thread tarred/coatedg) Phrase Length  Phrase length must be short (9 in or less) to minimize floats entangling in mesh, to keep meshes close to lead and float lines, and to ensure proper hanging when deployed.  All meshes must be hung on a double selvage and hung on  basis.h) Net Boxes  Nets must be delivered in net boxes, with 2 to 4 nets per box.  Boxes should be of a rigid -in plastic/rubber polymer vacuum-formed for durability, easy handling, and easy stacking and storage with dimensions of 36 in x 24 in at the top, tapered sides to a bottom of 28 in x 16 in.  Depth should be 11 in.  Pictures are available for reference if needed.
Table 1.  Specifications of gill nets to be repaired or replaced.  Fifty nets have external lead lines which will need to be replaced with 30-lb lead core line. Of the remaining 62 nets, 18 are in poor condition, 40 are in fair condition, and 4 are in good condition but will need panels of mesh replaced .

<p class="MsoNormal">The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), located on the National Naval Medical Campus (NNMC) in Bethesda, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SteelCloud in Ashburn, VA for a one-time license for Remote Synchronous and Asynchronous Replication base and expansion of a primary SAN server, as well as one year of maintenance and 24x7 Copilot Support for the same SAN server.<span>&nbsp; </span>The listed services are required to maintain USU&rsquo;s primary and secondary SAN servers.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These services will be procured in accordance with the procedures of FAR Part 12-Commercial Items and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sole source determination is made in accordance with:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">FAR Part 13.106-1 Soliciting Competition</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(b) Soliciting from a single source</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>USU currently has two SAN servers that back each other up and replicate the data that the other server contains.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both servers were installed by SteelCloud, which operated under license from Compellent Technologies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only Compellent Technologies has the proprietary rights to the system software updates and technology required to maintain both servers.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although there are multiple distributors of Compellent Technology&rsquo;s SAN server support services, both servers must be maintained by the same company in order to ensure that both servers can &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to each other and to ensure that they are updated simultaneously.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the two servers were maintained and updated by different maintenance companies, it would be impossible to keep the two systems in harmony, which could lead to loss of critical data through sytem failure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further, in order for maintenance technicians to diagnose a problem with a server, the technicians must be able to access both servers.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the technicians only have access to one server, they will not be able to correctly diagnose problems, which could again lead to system failure.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>SteelCloud currently has a contract to perform the required maintenance and service on the backup or secondary SAN server.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, it is imperative that SteelCloud also perform the required maintenance on the primary SAN server.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sources interested in responding to this requirement must be able to provide compelling evidence that they can provide the abovementioned requirement as specified.<span>&nbsp; </span>A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contractual action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>Responses must be received via email (<a href="mailto:benjamin.kacher@usuhs.mil">benjamin.kacher@usuhs.mil</a>) by 9:00 a.m. EST on December 23, 2010.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>E.7 FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(Tailored)</p>
<p>The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Use of industry standard and/or non-proprietary tools.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Management Approach</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Management organization and business model.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2 - Proposed organizational structure and staffing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Quality Control</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1 - Quality Control &amp; Performance Monitoring.</p>
<p>Factor 4 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Price/Cost<br /><br />Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control, and Past Performance are listed in descending order of importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than price. As technical scores converge, the price grows more important in making the award selection. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>a) The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are significantly unbalanced.</p>
<p>b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />E.8 EVALUATION CRITERIA AND RELEVANT IMPORTANCE <br />The following criteria will be used in the evaluation of proposals:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors<br /><br />Factor 1: Technical Approach.</p>
<p>The Technical Proposal should address each work area in sufficient detail to demonstrate a clear understanding of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), including development/enhancement and operations and maintenance activities. General statements that the offeror understands, can, or will perform the listed functions without supporting information/narrative is inadequate. Paraphrasing the PWS or parts thereof, is similarly inadequate, as are phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well-known techniques will be used." This volume shall be written to enable evaluators to make a thorough evaluation as to whether the services offered adequately respond to the specific Government requirements. The Technical Proposal shall clearly delineate the division of performance between the prime Contractor, Teaming Partners and the first-tier Subcontractor(s), if applicable. The offeror's technical approach shall address the sub-factors listed below:<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Proposed technical approach supports PWS requirements. Offerors shall describe, in detail, the proposed technical approach for addressing the PWS requirements in their response. The offeror's proposal should also demonstrate their ability to protect the Coast Guard systems and the integrity and the confidentiality of the information contained within them. It is essential to the Coast Guard that protection of the infrastructure is met in order to meet mission-critical objectives. Offerors shall include a narrative discussion of their efficiencies and unique aspects of the technical approach. The proposal should include discussion of knowledge, experience and applied use of industry best practices. The offeror's technical approach should address the strategy for evaluating and recommending new and emerging technologies; hardware and software products related to security; the development of effective IT security guidance and policies that reduces the Coast Guard's vulnerabilities to cyber threats. The proposal should address the strategy for providing technical, administrative, and management security assistance as it relates to IT security incidents; Certification and Accreditation Support for sensitive and unclassified (SBU) Systems and Classified (C-LAN Systems across Coast Guard) systems; assistance in developing IA awareness and Information System Security training programs and TEMPEST support. The offeror's technical approach should address these strategies to support DHS, DOD, USCG missions and IT security operations. The offeror's proposal shall clearly demonstrate a sound approach to, and alignment with, the DHS 4300a and USCG COMDINST 5300.13b Information Assurance Manual as well as CJCSM 6510.01A Information Assurance (Ia) And Computer Network Defense (CND)Volume I (Incident Handling Program); DoD Instruction 8500.2, Information Assurance (IA) Implementation. &amp; DoD Instruction 8500.1, Information Assurance (IA) Manual.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor must provide one documented example of IA Tactics Techniques Procedures (TTP) developed for the government by your organization. Provide at least one (1) example each of Incident Handling and Concept of Operations (CONOPS).</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide one documented example of a successful Certification and Accreditation submission of a major application or system for a government agency to include agency name, project plans, documents completed, methodologies used and number of revisions required in the overall process.<br /><br />&bull; Contractor must show previous experience in providing Information System Security Officer duties by including one (1) example of how they have supported government agencies. This example shall show experience with DHS and or DoD mandated tools in support of ISSO duties. The example shall be supplemented by resumes of the ISSO.</p>
<p>&bull; The Contractor must provide one (1) example of how TEMPEST requirements and support have been met through previous contracts. The example shall include certification document or TEMPEST Field Technical Authority.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of procedures your company developed or implemented in support of Vulnerability Management and Scanning at a government agency including the name of the agency and POC information.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of procedures your company developed or implemented in support of IT Forensics.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2: Use of industry standard and/ornon-proprietary tools. <br /><br />&bull; Contractor shall provide a one-page narrative of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tools utilized in support of a government agency's computer network defense to include how the data was analyzed, the name of the agency and POC information.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Management Approach.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offerors's Management Approach/Plan for the purposes of determining how well their management plan demonstrates its ability to sustain adequate resources throughout the life of the IDIQ that will be needed to successfully meet all of the PWS requirements (see Attachment I). The management approach proposed by the Offeror is critical to the success of this effort. Therefore, the management approach must be explicitly explained and presented in the proposal so as to provide the USCG with a complete description of how the effort will be managed. The management approach shall clearly describe a complete understanding by task of the required actions, anticipated workload, labor needs by type, by providing resumes that outline relevant skills, experience and by describing management controls that will be established and used to monitor individual and/or overall tasks to include the mechanism for retaining the proposed labor skill mix. The management approach shall be evaluated as to how autonomous the Contract Program Manager is including lines of authority, contracting authority, hiring and removal plans; clearly defined security clearances and citizenship requirements; Teaming Partner arrangements, and Subcontractor teaming arrangements, including proposed prime/Teaming Partner/Subcontractor relationships, tasks to be performed by Teaming Partners/Subcontractors and authority/autonomy delegated to Subcontractors by prime Contractors; management and staffing practices, incentive and awards programs, recruiting methods, training plans and career development activities; clearly defined Key Personnel with inclusion of resumes; and response to changes in customer needs, tasking, and workload requirements. <br />The offeror's proposal should demonstrate its management approach with emphasis on the applied use of management controls, IT certification concepts and policies to ensure appropriate management and execution of Information Technology (IT) Information Assurance Security Management Services on the classified and unclassified IT infrastructure and their unique operational requirements and all applicable DHS and USCG security and performance standards applicable to these systems. The Offeror's management approach should clearly demonstrate their ability to deliver services and capabilities on-time, within budget, and with the required service quality. The offeror's proposed organizational structure and staffing should clearly demonstrate the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish all tasking in the PWS. <br />Offerors shall identify current information technology certifications held by key technical positions included in the proposal. Offerors shall address the extent to which the proposed key personnel have committed themselves to work on this effort. If the key personnel have worked on any of the contracts used in past performance, identification of those contracts and the role of key personnel should be stated.<br /><br />Sub-Factor 1: Management organization and business model. Offerors will be evaluated on their overall management organization and business model for accomplishing the requirements of the PWS. If teaming arrangements are proposed contractors shall clearly detail each team member's roles and responsibilities and size of business. The contractor shall also provide a list of all first tier sub-contractors. The proposal shall address the autonomy of the on-site Contract Program Manager with respect to management of all personnel, teaming members, Subcontractors, and overall execution of tasking under the IDIQ contract(s). The offeror's proposed organization and business model shall demonstrate relevant aspects including, but not limited to: proposed plan for utilizing a proposed approach to project planning and scheduling, tools for monitoring, controlling and reporting progress (including the progress of Subcontractors), and the proposed on-site management team for the prime Contractor/Teaming Partners and all proposed Subcontractors. The offeror's proposal shall describe the role of all proposed Teaming Members and Subcontractors in the overall management and execution of Contract tasking. <br /><br />&bull; Contractor shall provide one (1) example of procedures for recruiting, training and retention to fill vacant positions and maintain continuity of personnel.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2: Proposed organizational structure and staffing. The offeror's proposal will be evaluated on their proposed overall organizational and staffing structure, to include: (1) staffing levels that align personnel by proposed task and proposed labor category, and (2) staffing information to support their proposed level of effort for the tasking detailed in the PWS. The offerors will also be evaluated on the qualifications, education, experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. Resumes for key personnel, including past and/or current experience, education and/or training, along with statements of availability and letters of commitment from key personnel/Teaming Partners and Subcontractors, shall be submitted as part of the offeror's proposal. The offeror's proposed staffing structure shall also specifically address the offeror's approach to staffing positions requiring Top Secret (TS) and/or TS/SCI clearances to support certain Classified work at the C4IT Service Center (SC) as described in the PWS. <br /><br />&bull; The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel to perform all requirements in this contract. All Contractor employees supporting this contract shall be citizens of the United States, shall be able to read, write, speak and understand English. All Contractor employees supporting this IDIQ contract must be able to obtain and sustain a Secret Clearance throughout the duration of this contract. However, the Contractor may be required to have a Secret, Top Secret (TS), and Top Secret (TS) Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). As a condition of privileged access to any information system, personnel performing IA functions as described in the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, DoD 8570.01-M, must satisfy both preparatory and sustain DoD IA training and certification requirements (see DoD 8570.01-M, Chapters 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11). Additional guidance regarding these requirements will also be referenced in the Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, DoD 8570.01-M. <br /><br />Factor 3: Quality Control.<br /><br />Offerors shall describe their corporate Quality Control Program and how the corporate office will evaluate on-site quality control efforts. Quality control should address the method of ensuring the quality of delivered IT services and capabilities, as well as the accuracy of cost, labor, and invoice projections. The quality control program narrative should also include a discussion of the proposed methods for ensuring cost accountability through the use of efficient and effective solutions and alternatives.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1: Quality Control &amp; Performance Monitoring. The offerors will be evaluated on their proposed Quality Control Program. The Program should describe the offeror's ability to effectively utilize time, material and staff hours in an equitable manner to achieve the greatest results with a minimum of time and effort. The Program should likewise address the offerors approach to continuous improvement, capturing lessons learned, and sharing these lessons learned across all contracted personnel assigned to this Contract. Offerors shall describe the proposed on-site quality control process, including methods of monitoring performance to meet acceptable quality levels identified in the PWS, as well as established Performance Metrics, and shall propose additional measurable requirements and corresponding performance metrics. <br /><br />DO NOT submit a Quality Control Plan with your proposal. A comprehensive Quality Control Plan supporting the PWS requirements will be required after Contract award.<br /><br />&bull; Offerors must provide a copy of their quality control processes and procedures that are standard industry practiced. <br /><br />Factor 4: Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors with previous contract experience within the IT Information Assurance security environment should list and summarize their performance on similar or related contracts currently in progress or completed within the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3) references to include specific points of contact, e-mail addresses for those contacts, contract number, contract type, contract period of performance, and brief description of the requirement. In determining whether past performance information is relevant or not relevant, consideration will be given to contracts of similar project complexity, scope, type, and schedule within the IT Information Assurance security environment. Offeror(s) may be asked for additional information about problems encountered and corrective actions taken when negative information has been submitted by references. If past performance information is either not relevant or not available, then the offeror will be rated neutral (neither favorably nor unfavorably). In addition, the Contracting Officer has the discretion to retrieve information via the offeror's supplied references and federal sources to include the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).</p>
<p>To be considered relevant, the offeror must have been performed within the past three (3) years within the IT IA environment. All information and references are subject to verification by the Technical Evaluation Team. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the proposals received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and cost control and business relations. A list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts completed during the past 3 years, a list of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts currently in progress, or a combination of similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts that have either been completed in the past 3 years or are currently in progress. Similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders, and/or subcontracts listed may include any contract, delivery order, purchase order and/or subcontract larger than $2,500 entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts shall list similar contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts as required above for proposed key personnel. Provide the following information for each contract, delivery order, purchase order, and/or subcontract:</p>
<p>(A) Name of Contracting Activity<br />(B) Contract Number<br />(C) Contract Type<br />(D) Total Contract Value<br />(E) Description of Contract Work<br />(F) Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No.<br />(G) Program Manager (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if applicable)<br />(H) Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No.<br />(I) Administrative Contracting Officer (or equivalent) Name and Telephone No. (if different from F)<br />(J) List of teaming partners/first-tier subcontractors (if applicable)</p>
<p>The offeror may provide information on both problems encountered and corrective actions taken to resolve those problems on the contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts identified. The offeror should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts, delivery orders, purchase orders and/or subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from the references provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>The offeror may describe any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for developing and producing the product or service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) that received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over 3 years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply.</p>
<p>Past performance will be evaluated in terms of Quality of Technical Services and Approach, Quality of Contract Management and Management Approach, and Customer Satisfaction. Each contract shall only be referenced once. Past performance information should be provided for services directly relevant to the services to be performed under the IDIQ PWS. To be considered relevant, the services must have been performed within the past three (3) years. The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information in conducting the evaluation other than the information submitted with the quotations received. The Government will evaluate the quality, timeliness, cost control and business relations.<br /><br />Factor 5: Price/Cost</p>
<p>Offerors are to submit price proposals that provide complete pricing for services in accordance with the Performance Work Statement and Attachment II - IT IA Pricing Table. Proposals that are unrealistic in terms of overall price or reflective of an inherent lack of management and/or technical competence or comprehension of the requirements shall be further excluded from evaluation.<br /><br />&bull; Total Evaluated Price. Price Analysis will be performed to determine the reasonableness of the offeror's price proposal. Reasonableness will be based on the total evaluated price. Total evaluated price will be calculated on the sum of the Contract Line Item Numbers [see Section B.1]. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, only information that is necessary to determine price reasonableness must be utilized. No additional information from the offeror is necessary if the price is based on adequate price competition.</p>
<p>Information other than cost or pricing data that may be evaluated during a price reasonableness determination is as follows: <br /><br />&bull; Information related to prices (e.g., established catalog or market prices or previous contract prices), relying first on information available within the Government; second, on information obtained from sources other than the offeror; and, if necessary, on information obtained from the offeror. When obtaining information from the offeror is necessary, such information submitted by the offeror shall include, at minimum, appropriate information on the prices at which the same or similar items have been sold previously, adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price.</p>
<p>&bull; Offeror's proposals will also be evaluated for price realism by comparing their proposed prices to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE). The IGCE is based on historical prices for similar services that have been procured during the last five years as well as labor rates from GSA Schedules.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete Section B. 1. and the IT IA Pricing - Attachment II of the solicitation including all fixed price line items and cost-reimbursable amounts. Offerors shall not deviate from the estimated amounts provided for the cost reimbursable CLINs.</p>
<p>Offerors shall calculate total for each line item by multiplying the quantity by the unit price. Offerors shall provide a subtotal for each year and an overall total price for the life of the contract. The Government will evaluate proposals for award purposes by adding the total price for all ordering periods to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of separately priced line items shall not obligate the Government to purchase separately priced line items. The Government may, at its discretion, accept any or all separately priced line items proposed by an awardee, if that awardees proposal for separately priced line items is sufficiently attractive.</p>
<p>The primary means of determining the "fairness and reasonableness" of proposed prices will be through competition and the comparison of the prices offered in response to this solicitation.</p>
<p>Offerors are placed on notice that any proposals that are unrealistic in terms of technical and management commitment or unrealistically low in overall price shall be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of management and technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Technical Approach, Management Approach, Quality Control and Past Performance are listed in descending order of importance , and when combined, are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>E.9 BASIS FOR AWARD - TRADE-OFF SOURCE SELECTION PROCESS <br /><br />The Government will award up to three (3) contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, all factors considered. Prospective offerors are advised that in consideration of Best Value a proposal meeting the solicitation requirements with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher priced offeror is determined to be more advantageous to the Government.</p>

<p>(a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed <br />directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government <br />Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) <br />by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(b) The copy of any protest shall be received in the office designated above within one day of<br />filing a protest with the GAO.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should submitted to:</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation will only be open for 24 hours due to the Government Continuing Resolution.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519.  The requirement is for the following McCabe items:
<p>CLIN 0001: Renewal of Maintenance for 56 McCabe 1Q Maintenance, M-IQ-Server, Period of Performance February 01, 2011 - January 31, 2012</p>
<p>CLIN 0002: Renewal of Maintenance on 56 McCabe IQ Linux Extension Software, Period of Performance February 01, 2011 - January 31, 2012</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: NGA has a requirement for the brand name software licenses and annual software maintenance coverage as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of McCabe. The McCabe suite of software has already been integrated into the NGA enterprise.  Due to this fact, it would be extremely costly to switch to a different type of software.   Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software.  The McCabe IQ Software suite is the only software suite that fulfills the salient features of this requirement at this time.&nbsp; McCabe Software, Inc. is the sole source provider of the McCabe Software Suite Maintenance.</p>

Offerors with no past performance shall be evaluated with a neutral rating under the past performance volume.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the following responses to questions posed by potential offerors:
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> <br />What are we going to be setting up for? What uses will the equipment serve as?<br /><strong>Response:</strong> <br />The workstation will be used to record video and process video from our usability lab. It needs the ability to record an SDI SD/HD video + audio feed. It will then encode the video and export it to the NAS units, which will be remotely accessible from our workstations.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> <br />Will the assembly and installation of the equipment be required?<br /><strong>Response:</strong> <br />Installation is not necessary (or expected)<br /><br /><strong>Question 3:</strong> <br />Does the video capture card need to be complete internal or is an internal PCIe adapter card attached to an external processing unit acceptable?<strong>Response:</strong> <br />We would prefer an internal solution, but if something else meets our requirements, we will consider it.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> <br />Are the 16 hard drives to be installed in the NAS systems?<br /><strong>Response:<br /></strong>The hard drives do not need to be installed, we expect to do that. For all the equipment, we just want the hardware, we expect to set it up ourselves.</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to notify interested parties of two (2) corrections to be made to the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation which was issued on 12/14/2010.
(1)  In the Announcement Details under Set-Aside, it indicates this procurement is set-aside for Total Small Business; however, in the Description portion of the Announcement it states this procurement is FULL and OPEN COMPETITION.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Wet Mop Bucket and Wringer Set, Yellow to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
<SOLNBR>CP-12-14-10-01
<RESPDATE>123010
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-01-343-3776<br />Name: Wet Mop Wringer and Bucket Set, Yellow<br />Description: Yellow, 26-to-35-quart plastic mopping bucket features wide-stance casters and a metal bail. A plastic sideward press wringer accommodates 12-to-32-ounce mop heads and has a metal handle. Wringer is removable from the bucket.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-01-343-3776<br />Similar Items: RUB 7580-88 YELLOW, 640-7580-88, INC605152, 6Y-2635-3Y-90-605152, 78992088, RUB758088YW, 36904-04</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 30, 2010 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis for the upcoming acquisition of a Transportation Management Service (TMS) for the U.S. General Services Administration.
<p>GSA's Center for Transportation Management (QMCC) offers freight and household goods transportation services for federal civilian agencies. GSA is the sole agency mandated to procure and negotiate transportation rates on behalf of all Federal civilian agencies. GSA's solicitation and acceptance of rates and charges provide highly competitive pricing, which in many cases includes the solicitation and acceptance of rates specific to an agency's facility and shipping characteristics. GSA offers several programs to support the transportation needs of the Government.</p>
<p>Freight Management Program (FMP): FMP provides a framework for fulfilling the domestic freight shipping requirements of Federal agencies. GSA's Standard Tender of Service establishes a uniform basis for buying freight transportation through its rules and accessorial services. The program offers rate management services nationally for general commodity freight transportation.</p>
<p>Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP): GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP) assists relocating Federal Government employees in transporting household goods from one official duty station to another, both domestically and internationally. CHAMP stipulates provisions for transporting household goods, privately owned vehicles, and unaccompanied air baggage.</p>
<p>Currently, the transportation options are accessed through GSA's internet based Transportation Management Services Solution (TMSS).</p>
<p>QMCC's goal is to become the "provider of choice" for all transportation needs across the Federal Government and create a contemporary world-class portfolio program that consistently meets the needs of the Federal community. In order to support this goal, QMCC is acquiring a streamlined, adaptable world-class Transportation Management Service (TMS) that continually applies commercial best practices to realize transportation efficiencies and deliver a transparent, accountable, and sustainable service that yields exceptional customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>The overriding objectives for TMS are total cost savings for transportation spending for the Federal Government, industry best practices in transportation procurement, execution and visibility and advanced management reporting offered on a highly scalable platform. TMS will ensure the delivery of user friendly, customer-centric, configurable, policy-compliant, reliable, and secure Federal transportation management service using a contractor-owned, hosted, and operated model, e.g., an Application Service Provider (ASP) or Software as a Service (SaaS). The TMS provider will foster an environment of Government-wide collaboration among all parties to include all Federal agencies, all approved Transportation Service Providers (TSP) and GSA. <br />QMCC seeks to identify &lsquo;one solution' to support all of its needs. Any contract resulting from the Statement of Work (SOW) will provide for a TMS that improves usability, advanced functionality, accessibility, performance, reporting and security.</p>
<p>Full operational capability is expected by January 2012.</p>
<p>The contract type anticipated will be a Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract. The Period of Performance is expected to be for one (1) Base Year Period, with at least four 1-year options to renew. This procurement is not a Set-Aside for Small Business concerns. However, all qualified Small Business concerns are encouraged to submit offers. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541519 and the size standard to be considered a Small Business is $25M in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>All offerors must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov. Offerors must also complete Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Large businesses will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan. Offers must be in English and U.S. Dollars. Solicitation QMAC-RK-110001-N will issue on/about&nbsp;January 10, 2010 at this website (www.fbo.gov), and will close approximately 30 days after solicitation issuance. <br /><br />December 15, 2010 Update:&nbsp; Please find attached the file (TMSInfo.ppt) that provides the location of the presolicitation conference.&nbsp; Please also find 10 attachments to the draft solicitation for review and comment.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS&nbsp;AMENDMENT SERVES TO CORRECT THE RESPONSE DUE DATE IN INCLUDED IN IN THE ORIGINAL NOTICE. RESPONSES ARE DUE JANUARY 13, 2011 BY 3:00 PM EASTERN TIME</strong>.<br /><br />Notice Type: Sources Sought<br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is a Request For Information (RFI); a market research mechanism used by the Government to gauge the marketplace and learn the industry's capabilities. <br />The information requested hereunder is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or contract awarded. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information. Responses to the notice will not be returned. The Government will not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with Government regulations. <br />Program Introduction:<br />Initiated in 2000, with the passage of the Coral Reef Conservation Act, NOAA's CRCP supports effective management and sound science to preserve, sustain and restore valuable coral reef ecosystems. The CRCP headquarters operations are located in Silver Spring, MD, with significant field staff in the Pacific and Caribbean regions.
<p>The CRCP is a partnership among NOAA, the seven US coral reef jurisdictions, and numerous other federal agencies, academic institutions, and NGOs. The CRCP brings together expertise from NOAA's Line Offices for a multidisciplinary approach to managing and understanding coral reef ecosystems. These offices carry out, directly and in partnership, a wide range of activities, including mapping and monitoring of coral reefs, research on various aspects of coral reef science and resource management. The CRCP facilitates and supports partnerships with scientific, private, government and nongovernmental groups at local, state, federal and international levels. <br />The CRCP also plays a key role in the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (USCRTF), an inter-agency task force, authorized under Executive Order 13089. The Department of Commerce (represented by NOAA) and the Department of Interior co-chair the USCRTF. The CRCP provides staff support to the USCRTF. The USCRTF is composed of twelve Federal agencies, the seven states and territories that contain coral reefs, and the three Freely Associated States. A key partner in this effort will be the All Islands Committee of the US Coral Reef Task Force (AIC). The AIC is comprised of the Governor appointed points of contact (POC) to the USCRTF. <br />An external program review of the CRCP was completed in September of 2007. The review panel provided a series of recommendations for the CRCP. Among these recommendations was a call for the program to better meet the needs of coral reef managers in the jurisdictions and the completion of capacity assessments to better understand those needs. The CRCP subsequently developed, via extensive NOAA and external input, a "Roadmap for the Future" to lay out proposed changes to the Program. The Roadmap sets the primary objective of the CRCP as addressing strategic management needs. To address this objective, the CRCP recently funded a process to articulate a set of strategic coral reef management priorities per jurisdiction to effectively complement place-based coral reef management efforts by Federal, state, territorial, and local management communities. As a result, each of the seven coral reef jurisdictions now has a set of agreed upon strategic coral reef management priorities. The Roadmap further calls for the CRCP to work with managers to assess the capacity to implement the identified priorities. <br />Overview of Potential Requirement:<br />The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is seeking information/capability statements from interested parties to support the Coral Reef Conservation Program's (CRCP) capability (services and products) to assess the capacity of state and territorial coral programs to achieve their stated priorities for coral reef management. <br />A prospective Contractor shall provide expertise in capacity assessment methodologies as well as have demonstrated understanding of, and experience in, the technical components of multi-disciplinary coral reef conservation programs (e.g. marine protected area management, fisheries management, coastal zone management, etc.). The prospective Contractor will (1) work closely with the CRCP and our local partners to review and provide recommendations on improvements to a draft methodology for conducting the capacity assessments (see attached draft methodology), (2) use the revised methods to develop a jurisdiction specific work plan for implementing the capacity assessment, (3) travel to the jurisdiction to conduct the capacity assessment, and (4) provide a report on capacity assessment in the jurisdiction and recommendations for building capacity. Steps two through four will be completed in sequence for each of the seven coral reef jurisdictions after which the contractor will (5) develop a synthesis report recommending programmatic actions for the CRCP to consider in working with partners to develop capacity for local coral reef conservation. <br />See attached draft methodology for additional information. <br />How to Respond:<br />Responses should include a capability statement outlining parties' qualifications and past experience conducting capacity assessments. The statement should also contain company name, address, point(s) of contact, telephone number, fax number and e-mail address. Responses are to be submitted electronically in Microsoft Word (not to exceed 25 pages; including appendices, diagrams, and examples using 12 point Time New Roman font). Submit responses electronically (using PDF or Microsoft Word) no later than 3:00 pm eastern, December 13, 2010 at the following address: robert.mcnamara@noaa.gov</p>

<AWARDEE>Redding Steel
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) intends to award a BPA to Redding Steel "to supply BEP's plate manufacturing steel material for the production of surface pieces."
<p>The provided steel must be very pure to wire cut the parts, EDM and finish to meet ISO and BEP requirements. If impurities are present in the material, the material will fail during production. Test showed steel from other vendors were not heat treated properly.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be made under a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) per FAR part 6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency. BEP is in need of this requirement and having a sufficient test evaluation would delay the award of a contract which would cause serious time delay and financial injury to the Government.</p>
<p>The period of performance is December 20, 2010 through December 19, 2011.</p>
<p>Contact Mark Anderson, Contract Specialist, at Mark.Anderson@bep.gov with any questions regarding this notice. Any interested vendors may be considered on future acquisitions for this requirement.</p>

<DESC>This is a four-year Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) Term, Level-of-Effort contract. The purpose of CEED II is to grow and expand key competitive industries in Moldova. <br />&bull;&middot; Objective 1: Increased productivity in targeted industries. The implementing contractor may provide project-supported interventions at any point in the value chain for increased productivity in the industry and individual enterprise. Project objectives and underlying activities are thus to be directed toward providing assistance to helping the industry identify and implement solutions that lead to higher levels of productivity, thereby paving the way for growth and entry into new markets. <br />&bull;&middot; Objective 2 - Trade and investment increased for targeted industries. Activities will facilitate trade and investment transactions. Technical assistance will help resolve export and investment financing problems faced by Moldovan companies in their attempts to be competitive on international markets as well as to support the attraction of increased levels of business investment, both foreign and domestic. CEED II will similarly promote international product and process standards that facilitate entry into international markets.
<p>&bull;&middot; Objective 3- Public-private dialogue improved to better ensure that key industries have supportive relationships with government. Activities will address industry-specific legal, regulatory and administrative factors identified as inhibiting industry growth and investment, through representative organizations.

<DESC>The work consists of furnishing all labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform Operation and Maintenance Services for DOD Army Medical Facilities nationwide, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.  Anticipated work contains full-service, continuous-coverage operation and maintenance (O&M) of medical facilities to include preventive, predictive, demand, and emergency maintenance.  In addition, task orders may be awarded for construction requirements incidental to O&M (such as installation/extension of utilities, minor reconfiguration of treatment areas to support new medical equipment, etc).  There are a wide variety of buildings and finishes (and a variety of building ages and conditions) that will be covered on any given O&M Task Order.  Buildings vary from World War II lapped siding to new pre-engineered metal buildings to towering steel-frame pre-cast concrete skinned multi-story buildings.  Example systems and equipment include but are not limited to emergency generators; electrical switchgear; electrical distribution; lighting; plumbing systems; roof and storm drain systems; heating ventilation, and air conditioning [HVAC] heating boilers; HVAC water chillers; HVAC cooling towers; HVAC pumps; variable frequency motor controllers; HVAC air handling units; operating room and isolation room pressurization systems; digital HVAC controls; nurse call; patient monitoring systems; intrusion detection systems; infant abduction systems; fire detection/alarm systems; fire sprinkler systems; carbon dioxide, wet and dry chemical fire suppression systems; elevators; pneumatic tube and box conveyor transport systems; medical gas systems to include medical air compressors, medical vacuum pumps, bulk oxygen tank farms, and medical gas and vacuum distribution and alarm panels; laboratory fume hoods; interior finishes; signage systems; structural building components such as roofs and building exterior fa ade; and passive fire protection systems (including fire and smoke partition integrity maintenance).  Contractors must be aware of the health and life safety issues that must be considered while performing these demanding O&M tasks in an occupied medical treatment facility - many with a critically ill inpatient population.  Specific requirements, such as the stringent infection control measures in place at all medical treatment facilities, will be identified in the individual task orders, but Contractors are advised that special requirements (to include requirements ranging from badging to immunization requirements for individual workers) are typically required because the work will be performed in occupied medical treatment and/or medical research facilities.<BR><BR>The Government awarded five Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts resulting from this solicitation which will include a base year. Options one thru four may be exercised at the discretion of the Government.   Firm Fixed-Price Task Orders will be issued against the contracts. The total maximum value to be shared amongst all contracts awarded under this solicitation is $200,000,000.00.<BR>

<DESC>Dominion Federal owns the temporary facilities being leased under the current contract. Award to any other contractor would result in unnecessary costs to a pass through company (middleman). Any contractor except Dominion Federal would, of necessity, experience investment or start-up costs estimated to exceed $1 million for these large facilities and the Government would not recover such cost through competition to replace the leased facility. Changing contractors would require the complete removal and replacement of the facilities and its infrastructure (water, power, HVAC, etc.). Costs not expected to be recovered through competition include site work; site preparation and foundation costs, and utility work; electric, water, sewer, and storm drainage. The real property portion of this acquisition coupled with the site work, if over $750,000 becomes Military Construction (MILCON) and funds would need Congressional appropriation, taking up to 3 years to appropriate. Currently, the estimated cost to build a permanent facility is $27 million but no appropriation has been set aside for this project.
<p>USCENTCOM, including the Coalition, are heavy communicators; data and audio visual users. The average cost for CENTCOM to "comm-up" each of the 460 workstations is approximately $2,000, approximately $920K. Cost of new furniture is estimated to be approximately $1,500 per workstation (460) or approximately $690K. Security includes access control, CCTV monitoring and intrusion detection. For a facility this size, the security cost would be a minimum of $500K. Lost man-hours cost to move people, temporarily house and then build a similar facility would result in a non-recoverable cost of approximately $3.0M plus the contractor tear down fee. <br /><br />Additionally, the Government would have to change maintenance contractors which would result in a degradation of services to the facility and the occupants as well as possibly impacting the mission of USCENTCOM. Any disruption of this mission could have serious strategic and political ramifications beyond monetary value. <br /><br />Award to another contractor would require temporary suspension of the 24 hour operation. There are insufficient existing facilities to accommodate coalition forces during the removal of the existing trailers and the installation and re-configuration of the replacement trailers. USCENTCOM mission dictates no disruption in continuity or cohesion.<br /><br />Communication within the facilities must be established via a Protective Distribution System (PDS) IAW AFI 33-221. The cost of a PDS is approximately $200 per linear foot; the further away from CENTCOM HQ, the higher the cost. Land in close proximity to house a temporary facility would need to be tied up and improved. To utilize the nearest aircraft apron space to the existing facility, the PDS would need to be extended approximately 500 ft from the nearest manhole at a cost of more than $100,000.</p>
<p>The mission of the Coalition is to support the strategic objectives of their respective nations, the United States and CENTCOM by coordinating the Strategic Integration of Coalition resources to satisfy capability requirements of Combined and Multi-National Task Forces within the US Central Command Area of Responsibility as well as regional political stability. Any disruption of this mission could have serious strategic and political ramifications beyond monetary value. Moving these country representatives could be viewed as an insult or at least question US priority. This mission is required to continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>Known cost savings to lease from the current owner will be $1,170,887.00, which were the actual costs expended to construct, configure and retrofit the equipment to meet the specialized needs of the end-user. Additional anticipatory cost expenditures are estimated to be far and above what was initially expended to establish this facility as these costs would include temporary relocation of existing personnel and equipment to a temporary facility while the existing complex was removed and a new facility erected</p>
