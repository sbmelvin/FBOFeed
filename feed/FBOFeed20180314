<SUBJECT>Radiation Inducible Molecular Targets Identification after Single and Fractionated Radiation in Prostate Carcinoma.
<SOLNBR>N02CO82528-95
<RESPDATE>032618
<CONTACT>Ricky J. Watson, Phone 2402766594, Email ricky.watson@nih.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), requires scientific services conducting radiation inducible molecular targets identification after single and fractionated radiation in prostate carcinoma. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, # N02CO82528-95, is issued as a request for quote (RFQ), and includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95 / 01-19-2017, simplified procedures for commercial items.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 and the business size standard is $15.0 M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to investigate common and differential changes in gene (mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA) profiles associated with fractionated and single dose radiation for the discovery of markers and druggable pathways in multiple human prostate cancer models.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>TASK 1</p>
<p>Analyze in vivo experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</p>
<p>This task seeks to understand differences in the cellular response to a bolus dose of radiation vs a fractionated dose by examining data from cells irradiated in vivo. In this task, the Contractor will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, the Contractor will look at the in vivo experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines.</p>
<p>TASK 2</p>
<p>Merge in vivo, in vitro, long term in vitro, and in vitro 3d model datasets to identify signals across all three experimental conditions relevant to radiation injury classification.</p>
<p>This task seeks to understand differences in the cellular response to a bolus dose of radiation vs a fractionated dose by examining data from all datasets available. In this analysis, the Contractor will merge the in vivo, in vitro, long term in vitro and in vitro 3d model data to create one comprehensive dataset, for both the mRNA and lncRNA datasets. The Contractor will look at the combined experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice, then will run a qualitative analysis of the identified signals to determine if the signals are relevant to study radiation injury in humans. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. Performance of these models will be compared to the in vivo model results from Option 1 to determine if additional experimental data adds information to the classification of radiation injury. By using the performance in a similar classifying scheme between radiation doses as a point of comparison, the Contractor will highlight the common signals that are potentially found using different experimental methods to support future research into these signals as biomarkers of disease.</p>
<p>TASK 3</p>
<p>Analyze in vitro and in vitro 3d model experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</p>
<p>This task seeks to characterize similarities and differences between the response to radiation of cells cultured in conventional vs. 3-D in vitro cell culture methods. Similar to Option 1, the Contractor will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, the Contractor will examine the in vitro and in vitro 3d model experimental data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines.</p>
<p>TASK 4</p>
<p>Analyze in vitro and long term in vitro experimental cell population data to identify signals for radiation injury classification.</p>
<p>This task seeks to understand similarities and differences in the response to radiation between cells cultured for a short term and long term in vitro. Similar to Option 1, we will use the sets of mRNA and lncRNA data to identify relevant signals for classification between three radiation-injury responses: 0Gy, 10Gy, and 10x1Gy doses. For both mRNA and lncRNA, we will examine the in vitro and long term in vitro data to understand signals important to identifying radiation injury in mice. This analysis will involve the development of an optimal model to distinguish between 0Gy, 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses, as well as 10Gy and 10x1Gy doses without the 0Gy control group. This work will involve data cleaning, feature selection of relevant signals by using wrapper and filter algorithms, and classification model development using several methods. These methods could include elastic net regression, random decision forests, support vector machines, and fused support vector machines.</p>
<p>TYPE OF ORDER</p>
<p>This is a firm fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>NON-SEVERABLE SERVICES</p>
<p>The services specified in each contract line item (CLIN) have been determined to be non-severable services - a specific undertaking or entire job with a defined end product of value to the Government.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&amp;D) NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.<br /><br />The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Office of the Director (OD) National Children's Study plans to compete and award a contract for a National Children's Study (NCS) Biological and Environmental Sample Repository.<br /><br />NICHD, in pursuit of its mission, conducted the National Children's Study (NCS) Vanguard, in collaboration with other agencies and institutes, as a pilot for a planned cohort study of environmental influences on child health and development.  Starting in 2009, recruitment strategies were tested in 43 counties across 31 states throughout the U.S.  The study enrolled over 5,600 birth families and followed them through 2014.  At protocol-specified study visits, questionnaires and interviews, neuro-psychosocial and cognitive assessments, and physical examination data were collected, along with nearly 19,000 biological and 5,500 environmental primary samples from which a sample repository of over 250,000 items was created.  NCS study information and data analysis files are maintained in the National Children's Study Data and Sample Archive and Access System (NCS Archive), and NCS biological and environmental samples are maintained in the NCS Biological and Environmental Sample Repository.  That information and material now are available through the NCS Archive for approved research projects by qualified investigators.  <br /><br />The major activity that is anticipated for the NCS Biological and Environmental Sample Repository will be storage of the NCS biological and environmental sample collection under conditions that maintain the integrity and high quality of the samples, the management of the inventory, and the identification, assembling, packing, and shipment of samples as directed to fulfill approved requests for samples from the NCS Archive. The Contractor will secure, catalog, store, inventory, retrieve, and disburse the human biological specimens and environmental samples from the National Children's Study Repository collection.  <br /><br />It is not anticipated that new material will be added to the NCS Repository collection, but results of laboratory analysis of NCS Repository samples will be added to the NCS Archive data.<br /><br />This RFP (NIHNICHD-OD-2018-4C) will be electronically available on or about April 5, 2018. The RFP may be accessed through the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov. All responsible sources may submit proposals. This is not a request for proposals. This requirement is defined as code 541715 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).<br />

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to solicit and negotiate a 20-month Firm Fixed Price Sole Source Task Order to Fidelity Technologies Corporation under the Fielded Training Systems Support (FTSS) IV Multiple Award Contract for a Class I Quick Response Modification (QRM) to replace the obsolete visual system projectors and obsolete operating systems used in E-6B Operational Flight Trainers (OFTs) 2F144A S/N 1 and 2F144A S/N 2 to ensure continued sustainment and protection against cybersecurity threats, for which Fidelity is already providing support as the Contractor Operation and Maintenance Services (COMS) contractor. The OFTs are located at the Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Seven (VQ 7), Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
 This is a one-time requirement that is not a long-term COMS effort. Due to the fact that they are already on-site and performing the COMS efforts, Fidelity is in the best position to perform this effort with minimal impact to training.  This task order is being issued under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(D) to satisfy a minimum guarantee. The anticipated award date for this contract is 16 April 2018 and will end 31 December 2019.
This synopsis is a notice outlining the Governments intent to contract for the Visual and Operating Systems Technology Refresh support for the E-6B OFTs located at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Don Spencer, at don.w.spencer@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2010, no later than 29 March 2018 at 0900 EST.
 Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that a different source would be advantageous to the Government. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received and a sole source procurement with Fidelity Technologies Corporation is awarded, no further synopsis will be provided.

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office intends to acquire, via full and open competition, Information Technology (IT) Technical support services required to facilitate the overall objective of the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Manpower, Personnel, Training and Education; MPTE) (DCNO, MPTE) (N1) and subordinate commands.

The scope of this effort will encompass all aspects of N16 CIO and IM/IT Requirements at the Echelon I level, as well as at the Echelon II/III level at BUPERS/NPC, CNRC, and NETC. The support will require direct interaction with action officers and program managers across the MPTE enterprise as well as all other Navy Enterprises and Enablers to support N1 IM/IT responsibilities.
  In addition, support will require the development and refinement of legacy Information System (IS) sustainment and transformation to the optimized MPTE operational construct.  Finally, the contractors will provide a continuum of on-site and off-site support to N1s action officers, program managers and analysts at all echelon levels, for multiple commands, and at multiple geographic locations. 
  
The required support is divided into ten (10) core functions: (1) CIO Strategic Support, (2) Data and Information Management, (3) Engineering Support, (4) IT System Support, (5) Network Support, (6) Information Assurance (IA)/Cyber Security, (7) Enterprise Business Intelligence (BI)/Enterprise Business Analytics, (8) Software Development, (9) Hardware Maintenance and Development, and (10) Business Process Reengineering (BPR).

Travel is anticipated.
 The Government anticipates performance will begin on 13 September 2018 and will continue, as required, for six years thereafter. For planning purposes, the total estimated yearly level of effort (LOE) is 403,200 hours (or 2,419,200 hours over the six year period). The applicable NAICs code is 541512 Computer Systems Design Services. The small business size standard for this NAICS is $27.5 million in annual receipts.

It is the intent of the Government to process this procurement under FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and to ultimately award multiple, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) cost-plus- fixed-fee (CPFF) contracts as a result of the forthcoming solicitation.

The IDIQ contracts will allow for both CPFF and firm-fixed-price (FFP) type task orders.
 Offerors will be required to submit non-cost/price (technical) and cost/price proposals. The Government anticipates that the resultant contracts will be awarded on a best value basis where the non-cost/price (technical) volume will be considered more important than the cost/price volume.

Upon its release, the solicitation will be issued electronically and be available for downloading at the NECO website: http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 29 March 2018. The closing date for the receipt of offers will be set forth in the RFP. Paper copies, faxed copies, or email copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFP and any amendments thereto.
 The Government will not pay for the information received.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by NAVSUP FLC Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office.  By submitting an offer, the offeror is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer.  By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award.

Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.
 Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.   Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted via email to Adelina.lacroce@navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) to procure subscriptions to the Water Information Sharing and Analysis Center (WaterISAC).

EPA has identified AMWA as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement.  The EPA's Office of Water (OW), Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water (OGWDW), Water Security Division (WSD), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460 has a need for the requested WaterISAC Pro.  This one-of-a-kind subscription service provides users with sensitive threat information, emergency response tools and the ability to network with a community of peers.  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) are confidential venues for sharing security vulnerabilities and solutions within an industry.  The WaterISAC is a forum to keep drinking water and wastewater utility managers informed about potential risks to the nation's water infrastructure from contamination, terrorism and cyber threats.  These unique capabilities are essential because they address a security need of water and wastewater utilities and government stakeholders, administered by a trusted sector partner, and mandated in federal directives.  Additionally, the WaterISAC Pro subscription service enables EPA to meet its homeland security obligations under Presidential Policy Directive 21, Presidential Decision Directive 63, and Executive Order 13636.  

The acquisition of these commercial subscription services will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519130, Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order consisting of a two-year subscription for 29 EPA employees. 

Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified in this notice.  Documentation must be submitted within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your request in writing to Tammy Adams via email at adams.tammy@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

NAICS Code: 541620 Environmental Consulting Services. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for continuation of services under the current contract, EP-D-12-044, as described below.<br /><br />The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has a requirement for Emissions, Air Quality, and Meteorological Modeling. This requirement is currently performed under Contract EP-D-12-044.<br /><br />This contract provides technical work products to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Support provided in accordance with the subject Statement of Work (SOW) will facilitate the application, development, and modification of emission inventories and emissions control information; the development and modification of emission modeling tools and other emissions related tasks; the development and processing of inputs to air quality and meteorological models; the evaluation of air quality and meteorological models and their associated preprocessors; and the analyses of modeled and ambient air quality, deposition, and meteorological data. The SOW for this requirement includes six primary tasks: Task 1 - Analysis of Emissions, Meteorological, Ambient, and Air Quality Modeling Data; Task 2 - Emission Inventory Modeling; Task 3 - Air Quality and Meteorological Modeling; Task 4 - Emission Inventory, Meteorological, and Air Quality Modeling Tool Development; Task 5 - Development of Data in Support of Emissions Modeling Tools; and Task 6 - Documentation and Technology Transfer Activities.<br /><br />The incumbent Contractor provides scientific, software, engineering, and analysis support for emissions modeling, air quality modeling and meteorological modeling needs for a variety of pollutants, including, but not limited to, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), PM2.5 component species, ozone, ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), Lead (Pb), gases contributing to climate change, mercury (Hg), and other air toxics.<br /><br />The current contract, EP-D-12-044, period of performance was extended for six months from September 30, 2017 to March 31, 2018 via Far Clause 52.217-8-Option to Extend Services. The Government intends to compete, negotiate, and award a follow on contract for a one-year base period and four one-year option periods in accordance with the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). However, due to delays in the acquisition process, the contract for follow on services will not be awarded prior to the current expiration date of March 31, 2018 of contract EP-D-12-044. Since the services of the contract are critical and cannot lapse, the EPA must extend the period of performance of the current contract for an additional six months to allow time for the new follow on contract to be awarded. The EPA intends to negotiate this period of performance extension on a sole source basis.<br /><br />There are no other contractors that have the capability of providing the level, breath, depth of support, and continuity of services that are required by OAQPS for Emissions, Air Quality, and Meteorological modeling.<br /><br />This notice will be posted for 15 calendar days.<br /><br />The intent of this notice alerts the vendor community to the extension of contract EP-D-12-044, and the upcoming opportunity for competition of this opportunity. This notification alerts all vendors to this action and to determine if any other source (s) exist; and, therefore, no solicitation is available. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether competition is viable. Responses to this notice should be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Jeffery Clodfelter via the following e-mail address (Clodfelter.Jeffery@epa.gov) within 15 calendar days from the date of this notice.<br />

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<strong>Request for Information (RFI): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ARC-190 High Frequency (HF) Radio</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Upgrade or Replacement<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p align="left">The United States Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Airborne Communication and Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3), AFLCMC/WNYBB, Robins Air Force Base, GA, is conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to provide market research information on upgrading or replacing the ARC-190 High Frequency (HF) radio currently flown on multiple aircraft in the DoD inventory.<br /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p align="left">Current Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems are highly dependent on HF radios for over the horizon, also known as beyond line of sight communications, specific to global conventional and unconventional mission requirements. The DoD currently uses the ARC-190 radio for these missions on the following aircraft:. B-1, B-2, B-52, C-130, RC-135, C-17, C-5, E-8, F-15E, KC-10, KC-135, HH-60, VC-25.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to characterize the current state of research, development, and production of systems that aircrew can use for HF communications requirements. Additionally, the government is interested in the ability to modify current ARC-190 radios or other existing radios to address known obsolescence issues with the current ARC-190 system and impacts on the planned shut-down of the ARC-190 production line.</p>
<p>Backward compatibility with existing systems is a desired goal to improve implementation costs although significant Life Cycle Cost savings would allow consideration of higher development and procurement cost. Enabling commonality across all AF airborne HF radios is also considered a supporting goal.</p>
<p>The government is aggressively pursuing open, non-proprietary, standardized electrical &amp; physical interfaces, message sets, and message protocols for all subsystems and data buses used in their airborne communications suites. The contractor is strongly advised to use when possible commercial off-the-shelf components that currently offer component interface specifications available to the general public at no cost.<br /><br />See Attached Request for Information and Contractor Capability Survey for additional information.</p>

<p>Request for Information</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />The official response date is April 13, 2018 by 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted (as a white paper) in response to this announcement is voluntary, the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on FedBizOpps.gov at www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS:<br />The U.S. Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (US AMSAA), in conjunction with the Joint Requirements Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) is seeking information on products, technologies, and/or approaches that could be utilized in the development of the Surface Solid/Liquid Chemical Agent Detector (SSLCAD) formerly known as the Next Generation Chemical Detector 2 (NGCD 2) Survey Detector.</p>
<p>The SSLCAD is to be employed to interrogate various surface areas within the battlespace to locate, detect, identify, and alert the operator to diverse liquid and solid hazardous chemicals. The SSLCAD is envisioned to be a capability supporting the Chemical/Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) environment, to include tactical (reconnaissance and surveillance) and dismounted site assessment missions. The SSLCAD will characterize the chemical threat which enables personnel to report the event. This information will support integrated warning, increase situational awareness, and improve battle management. Due to a myriad of missions and the multiple services the SSLCAD is envisioned to support, the SSLCAD will likely be a modular, tactical detector adaptable to support the various forces.</p>
<p>Information on products, technologies, and/or approaches received will be used to support the SSLCAD Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The technology (ies) may be currently commercially available, or in any phase of research and development. Please indicate whether the product, technology, or approach is mature, under development, or is in basic research.</p>

The follow on effort to contract W15QKN-14-C-0049 is anticipated to be solicited under the Program and System Support (PASS) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity, Multiple Award Contract. In accordance with the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 206.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island, on behalf of the Project Director, Joint Products, is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in an effort to identify capable sources for the production and delivery of the following MK80 Series General Purpose bomb bodies for Fiscal Year (FY) 20-22 requirements: MK84-6 Bomb Body (NSN: 1325-01-074-5693); and BDU-56/B Bomb Body (NSN: 1325-01-376-5088). The annual requirements are approximately 300 per year for the MK84-6 and approximately 950 per year for the BDU-56/B Bomb Body.<br />ITEM DESCRIPTION - The MK84-6 and BDU-56/B bombs are used as building blocks for numerous variants of non-guided and precision-guided air delivered munitions. These bomb bodies are steel forged, similar in construction and are used in the construction of 2,000 pound bombs. The aerodynamically designed steel case can house a high explosive fill or an inert fill used for training purposes. The bomb bodies include wells in the nose and are tail compatible with proximity sensors and mechanical, electrical, or electronic fuzes. They can be used with conical, non-retard or retarding fin assemblies, or with electro optical, laser and/or Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance airfoil kits.<br />CRITICAL PROCESSES/SKILSS - Manufacture of the MK84-6 and BDU-56/B Bomb Bodies requires special processes, equipment, facilities, and skills; and is a complex process that requires several operations. The general process for making these GP bomb bodies using forged steel varies for each end item usage. Critical processes include forming, welding/resistance welding, heat treating, machining, coating, testing, and assembling of the bomb bodies. Critical equipment and facilities may include: band saws/cutoff machines, forging presses, large induction heaters, water cooling chambers, double end lathes, total indicator reading gages/fixtures, wall thickness gages, flame/plasma arc cutters, metal inert gas/robotic welders, Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) lathes, submerged arc welders, resistance welders, continuous flow heat treat/draw systems, shot blast systems, multiple spindle drills/tappers, CNC vertical mills/machining centers, proof load testing and hydrostatic pressure test equipment, coordinate measuring machines, Brinell hardness and universal test machine, phosphate/paint systems, and various specialized material handling equipment, all of which must be large enough to handle sizes of steel pipe up to 19 inches in diameter and 98 inches long. Critical skills needed for production of these bomb bodies include forming and heat-treating setup personnel; inspection and testing technicians; maintenance, tooling, manufacturing, and quality control engineers; and machinists. <br />An acceptable vendor must be able to display the skills of its employees and establish expertise in completing essential operations of manufacturing the MK84-6 and BDU-56/B Bomb Bodies. Respondents to this RFI must have the available skills required to perform all production and testing operations necessary to deliver conforming end items to the Government. These skills must be available with sufficient experience and proficiency to produce these items in a timely and efficient manner. A respondent must also have or have the ability to obtain the appropriate machinery, tooling, and manufacturing engineering skills required to support quality production limitations. Any significant lead times with equipment or materials associated with production of this item should also be noted. <br />RESPONSES - Interested companies who consider themselves capable of manufacturing the MK84-6 and BDU-56/B Bomb Body requirements are invited to indicate their interest.<br />This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the USG. The USG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited. Industry responses to this RFI will not represent binding offers, and the USG cannot accept an industry response to form a binding contract. The USG intends to use any information submitted in response to this request to develop an acquisition strategy for future requirements of this item. The USG will hold all information submitted in a confidential status. <br />All submissions are requested electronically no later than 19 March 2018 in order to be considered in the development of acquisition strategy for this item. All responses shall be sent to Ms. Danielle Walters, danielle.m.walters3.civ@mail.mil. All responses to this RFI should reference in the subject: RFI Response for MK80 Series GP Bomb Bodies (MK84-6 and BDU-56/B).

<p>1.0 General Information</p>
<p>The Aviation Integration Division (AMCOM) is conducting market research in support of the procurement of the Block II MH-47G as replacement for the original 61 Reman MH-47G. The Reman MH-47G was produced from salvaged CH-47D and MH-47E airframes. The Block II MH-47G incorporates an Army common structural baseline and the Block II MH-47G configuration was established under the Reconfiguration program which modernized some systems and relocated equipment.</p>
<p>The Government requests industry information on cost-effective acquisition options. The expected end result of this effort will include all production activities necessary to produce, acceptance test and support production airworthiness release of six (6) MH-47G Block II aircraft with the option for eight (8) additional aircraft. The Government does not have a technical data package available that can support production of the MH-47G.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 10, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.

<DESC>THIS IS A Sources Sought Notice ONLY. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Fort Carson desires to procure the construction services of a responsible contractor to renovate and repair the Fort Carson Education Center, Building 1117 on a small business set-aside basis, provided 2 or more qualified small businesses respond to this sources sought synopsis with information sufficient to support a set-aside. Be advised that the U.S. Government will not be able to set aside this requirement if 2 or more small businesses do not respond with information to support the set-aside. We encourage all small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories (including, 8(a) Business Development Program, Small Disadvantage Business, Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned Small Business concerns), to identify their capabilities in meeting the requirement at a fair market price.
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or construction service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this sources sought notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFQ or IFB or RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government-wide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Government-wide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement. The anticipated NAICS code(s) is 236220; Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>A need is anticipated for the renovation and repair of the Fort Carson Education/Readiness Center, Building 1117. This three story brick building with a basement is about 50 years old, has a reinforced concrete frame and is structurally sound. Because it was originally built as a barracks, it has numerous small rooms which do not meet the needs of a state-of-the-art education/readiness center. The interior finishes are lacking. The hot water heating system is well beyond its intended service life and the building is inadequately cooled. The electrical system is inadequate and there is no lightning protection. The building doesn't have a fire sprinkler system or a mass notification system. The accessible restrooms were refurbished about eight years ago and are in good condition, and shall remain "as is". <br />This work is considered construction work in El Paso County, Colorado applicable to Construction Wage Rate requirements (Construction Type: Building). This requirement is not a design bid build. The Government will provide the design for vendors to bid.</p>
<p>All work shall be accomplished in accordance with the contract terms and conditions. The period of performance is estimated to be 360 days after the issuance of a notice to proceed. The successful offeror/bidder will be required to provide 100% performance and payment bonds. Attached is the draft Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p><br />In response to this sources sought, please provide:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.), and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>5. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition.

<p>F. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) is our Nation's most sacred shrine and iconic resting place for those who have made a significant sacrifice and commitment to the defense of our country in the Armed Services. ANC is open every day of the year, including holidays. ANC receives over three million visitors per year, including visits from the President of the United States, other heads of state, family members of the deceased, and millions of tourists from around the world. Visitation trends vary widely and are impacted by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: inclement weather, the time of day, day of the week, occurrence of special events or holidays, etc. Approximately 7,000 funerals are conducted annually, in addition to over 3,000 other ceremonies such as commemorations, wreath ceremonies, and head-of-state visits. The successful performance of the requirements of this contract is essential to ANC's ability to conduct its primary mission (conducting funeral services), support other ceremonies and special events, and manage all aspects of visitor operations.</p>
<p>G. REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide Visitor Operations and Visitor Screening Services at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) in support of the areas specified in Background (above).</p>
<p>a) Visitor screening services are a critical facet of overall visitor operations, and contribute to the security of ANC. The Contractor personnel would be responsible for providing 100% visitor screening of contractors, employees and visitors with the use of x-ray machines, magnetometer and operate Government Furnished Vehicles (Government Furnished Property - GFP), and visual ID checks in accordance with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). Personnel performing these services are not security guards as security services are provided by Government personnel.</p>
<p>b) Visitor assistance services support how ANC manages the large volume and diverse types of visitors, ranging from providing information and directions to visitors on the cemetery grounds to assisting with locating the graves of a family member or friend from the Welcome Center Information Desk.</p>
<p>c) Traffic control of vehicles and pedestrians contribute to the overall safety of all visitors. Many points of ANC pedestrian and vehicular traffic are within proximity of pedestrian and vehicular areas of Washington, D.C.; the safe passage within these meshed areas are an invaluable objective of overall cemetery operations to ensure all modes of visitor movements get where they need to as safely and quickly as possible.</p>
<p>d) The contractor shall provide all personnel, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, and non-personal services necessary to perform visitor screening, assistance, and traffic control as defined in this DRAFT Performance Work Statement (PWS), except for those items specified as government furnished property and services. The Government will not exercise any supervision or control over the contract service providers performing the service herein. Sub-contract service providers shall be accountable solely to the Contractor who, in turn, is responsible to the Government.</p>
<p>e) Further detail is provided in the DRAFT PWS attached to this announcement (Attachment 1).</p>
<p>H. ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 561210 with a Small Business Size Standard of $38,500,000. The Product Service Code is R799. Businesses of all sizes are encouraged to respond; however, each respondent must clearly identify their business size in their capabilities statement.</p>
<p>This documentation must address at a minimum the following items:</p>
<p>1.) Potential respondents shall provide their current/proposed company profile and identify how their current/proposed staffing and organizational capabilities would enhance and fulfill the Visitor Operations objectives as described in the consolidated DRAFT PWS.<br />2.) Provide company name, address, website address, name of primary point of contact (POC), email address of POC, business size, socioeconomic category (if any), Cage Code, DUNS and primary NAICS. <br />3.) What type of work has your company performed in the past in support of the same or similar requirement?<br />4.) Currently, the services are performed by two small businesses under two separate Contracts: W91QV1-14-C-0154 for Visitors Assistance Services was awarded as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside; and W91QV1-16-P-0227 for Visitors Screening Services was awarded as a Hubzone Small Business set aside. The Government anticipates consolidating, IAW 10 U.S.C. 2382, FAR 7.107-2, DFARS 207.170 and AFARS 5107.170, these two requirements and would like feedback as to why this is or is not a best procurement approach. To best facilitate competition, identify how the Government can best structure this requirement. Identify any conditions or actions that may have the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition.<br />5.) Potential respondents are encouraged to recommend and provide adequate details to support alternate NAICS to accomplish PWS.<br />6.) Potential respondents shall describe their current/proposed partnering financial structure to ensure contract success in accordance with the draft PWS. Please state whether you are interested in competing as a Prime for this requirement. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to satisfy the needs of the Government, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements.<br />7.) Describe in detail how designating this requirement as set-aside (specify) or unrestricted would be in the best interest of the Government.<br />8.) Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes, at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-2269, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.<br />9.) The estimated period of performance consists of a base year and four (4) options with performance commencing on or about 30 September 2018 (date is subject to change at the Government's discretion).<br />10.) The Government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to perform services consistent, in scope and scale, with those described in the DRAFT PWS.<br />11.) Identify any Federal contracts within the last 3 years in which the contractor as a prime or subcontractor was required to adhere to FAR clause 52.245-1, specifically paragraph (b)1.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


GENERAL INFORMATION 

Title of Project:  Hospital Beds   WASHINGTON DC VA MEDICAL CENTER 
                         
2.  Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide various beds based on the needs of the patient.

Background:  The Washington DC Veteran Affairs Medical Center purchased hospital beds in the past, however, it was not an economically feasible option to continue this practice due to the various medical needs of the patient. The hospital beds that are utilized are based on the patient s need and ailment, which is determined by the nurse involved in their care. For instance, some beds have a lower vertical reach while other beds are made for larger sized patients. In more critical situations, the hospital beds provide capabilities that align with a patient s sensitive condition. The demand for the hospital beds requested is based on the diverse requirements of the patient in care. The practice of renting hospital beds is common place within the VA due to the medical condition of the patient.  
4.  Type of Contract: Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity

5.  Place of Performance: Washington, DC VA Medical Center
             50 Irving St. NW
             Washington, DC 20422
6. Beds must be delivered and functioning within hospital by 10/01/2018.
. 
Medical Personnel Responsibility: 

Only the Nurse Manager of the department and the Wound Care Nurses in the DC VA Medical Center are authorized to call the vendor and request for a rental bed through the established contract.  

All information on current rental bed orders shall be provided to the designated COR. 

Issues involving contractor response, product, or service shall be provided to the designated COR.  
Invoicing:

The invoice shall contain the contract number, date(s) of service, and information on the individual beds provided to the medical center. The invoice shall provide information for the COR to determine the total number of bed s in usage and the locations of those beds.

The invoice shall act as a property listing of beds for accountability of services provided.

The invoice will provide a breakdown of all services provided for the previous month.

The contractor shall not invoice until all required documentation is complete. 

If the supporting documentation has not been completed before the invoice is received by COR at the medical center, the invoice shall be considered incomplete and will be returned.

The invoice may be resubmitted after completion of all required documentation.  However, for the purpose of computing interest under the prompt payment act, invoice receipt date shall be the date the resubmitted invoice is received by the COR at medical center.

Payment:

All payments made under the contract will be made monthly, in arrears, upon submission of a properly prepared invoice for the services furnished in the previous month.  No advance payments will be authorized.

Contractor shall submit an invoice on an individual basis for services provided. Invoices without proper documentation will be returned.

Payments under this contract will be made in accordance FAR 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer Other Than Central Contractor Registration.  The 

Company will provide the appropriate form and account information for electronic transfer.

Payments made by the medical center under this contract shall constitute the total cost of services provided by the Company.  The Company hereby agrees that in no event shall the Company bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration, or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against the beneficiary, the beneficiary s family, private insurer, Medicare or any other entity acting on the beneficiary s behalf, for services provided pursuant to this contract.  Billings rendered by the Company to the medical facility for services furnished to VA beneficiary under the terms of this contract shall be billings in full.

Contractor Services:

The contractor will provide services to the Medical Center 24 hours a day 7 days a week to include Holidays. 

The contractor will provide the medical facility with various beds and mattresses listed on the subject national contract. 

The contractor shall provide any equipment, tools, or items in sufficient quantities to perform their assigned tasks during the delivery and pick-up process.

Contractor and VA staff will meet on an as needed basis to evaluate overall effectiveness of the contract, resolve problems and improve policies and procedures.


Further clarification on the diversity of demand:

The hospital beds that are utilized are based on the patient s need and ailment, which is determined by the nurse involved in their care. For instance, some beds have a lower vertical reach while other beds are made for larger sized patients. In more critical situations, the hospital beds provide capabilities that align with a patient s sensitive condition. Some beds or mattresses are tailored to prevent and treat skin breakdown by providing uninterrupted pressure redistribution without the need to transfer the patient for additional therapy. Other beds have a built in extender to add length to the bed for tall patients, which would require additional cost for replacement bed with extended length without this feature. The bed is able to meet patient specific needs with various position controls such as dining chair which is best for post op surgical patients and vascular position for lower extremity swelling. 

Based on the various needs of the patient the purchase of hospital beds would not be economically feasible for the government, therefore, the hospital is requesting the continued use of rental beds. The practice of renting hospital beds is common place within the VA due to the diverse needs of the patient.

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire software programming services for the Mood, Brain, and Developmental Unit's virtual reality (VR) platforms and pilot treatments.
<p><br />The Mood Brain and Development Unit, has as its primary goal the elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying depression and related mood disorders. Depression is associated with aberrant processing and learning of environmental rewards. These aberrations can be studied using experimental tasks where subjects receive various rewards and their respective decision making is modeled. However, current experimental tasks are implemented in limited laboratory settings not resembling real-life experiences and lacking ecological validity. Last year, our Unit purchased equipment through Mode Four, LLC to conduct experiments and programming on novel virtual reality (VR) platforms and to pilot treatments that are using this modality. The VR equipment helped boost the Unit's translational potential for ecological validity, efficiency, youth-friendliness, and suitability for innovative treatment.</p>

<RESPDATE>040418

<CONTACT>Tharp, Scott
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE and is for market research purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS, OR BIDS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE.  

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is conducting market research to determine if there are interested, capable, and qualified offerors in the marketplace with the knowledge, skills, qualifications, and capability to perform the work described below.  

The EPA Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center (AWBERC) located at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr., Cincinnati, OH 45268, has a dated satellite TV infrastructure, and it does not process the incoming broadcast signals for HD broadcast within the building. The building is a 9-story building, with a newer coaxial cabling infrastructure supporting numerous televisions throughout the main building and attached annex wings. 

EPAs objective is for offerors to perform a site survey of the existing equipment and identify and install any/all suitable replacement equipment in order to process the incoming broadcast signals for HD broadcast onto the existing coaxial cabling infrastructure. The offeror is also required to identify and install equipment needed for individual televisions, depending on the offerors proposed solution. The offeror would also be required to specify any one-time installation costs, identify new equipment that would become Government property, and identify any monthly recurring costs for equipment that is provider-owned property.  Service Level Agreement (SLA) terms must be provided which identify resolution of outages of vendor equipment and incoming signal outages, and includes a problem/trouble call escalation chain enabling the EPA to elevate issues within the providers company, and receive credits for periods of signal outages when the cause is beyond the control of the EPA. 

This will be a firm-fixed-price contract.  The period of performance would be approximately 60 calendar days after award.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 515210, Cable and Other Subscription Programming, with a Small Business Size Standard of $38.5 million.  

It is our understanding this work is required to be conducted by either a local Satellite TV or Cable TV provider, however if there are offerors capable of providing this work we would like to understand your capabilities and qualifications.  Interested, capable, and qualified potential offerors are encouraged to reply to this market survey request by submitting a narrative demonstrating their experience in providing similar services.  

NARRATIVES SHALL BE NO LONGER THAN 5 TOTAL PAGES.  Please include a narrative for the requested information and discuss any questions/concerns you have for the project that need to be addressed/corrected; additional information such as brochures and other industry information is not included in the 10-page limitation.

Please include the following information in your response/narrative: (1) Company name, address, and point of contact information; (2) Identification and verification of the companys business status (i.e. Large, Small, Certified HubZone, 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, or Women-Owned Business; (3) Descriptions of Previous Experience, within the previous five (5) years, on projects considered similar in technical scope and complexity to the proposed EPA project.  Please include dates of work, references, project costs, and complexity of the projects; (4) A statement on the portion of the work that will be self-performed on this project, and how it will be accomplished; (5) A statement regarding a thorough understanding of the project and any questions/concerns that need to be addressed for the final Statement of Objectives document.

This market survey is to determine whether or not this project should be set-aside for small businesses or a small business sub-category based on the responses received.  If you have any questions, please contact Scott Tharp, Contracting Officer, at tharp.scott@epa.gov.  This is NOT a solicitation and does not constitute any commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be utilized by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.

Responses are to be sent via email to tharp.scott@epa.gov no later than 3:00 pm ET, April 4, 2018.  All interested firms must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award of Government contracts.  Please see www.sam.gov for additional registration information.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
<p>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), the Contracting Officer may solicit from one source if the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source is reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) on behalf of PSC, Health and Human Services (HHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) intends to sole source to:</p>
<p>Lena Chen<br />1200 N. Garfield Street, Apt. 720, Arlington, VA 22201</p>
<p><br />The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the U.S. government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The Department manages programs that cover a vast spectrum of activities that impact health, public health, and human services outcomes throughout the life span. HHS accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving Americans at every stage of life. Eleven operating divisions, including eight agencies in the U.S. Public Health Service and three human services agencies, administer HHS's programs. In addition, staff divisions within the Office of the HHS Secretary provide leadership, direction, and policy management guidance to the Department.</p>
<p>The Office of Health Policy (HP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) is a Staff Division in HHS that advises the HHS Secretary on policy development, and is responsible for major activities in policy coordination, legislation development, strategic planning, policy research, evaluation, and economic analysis. HP focuses on analyzing health policy issues, including public health, health care delivery, health care quality, health outcomes, health insurance, value-based purchasing, and health care financing programs in the public (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, State Children's Health Insurance Program) and private sectors. HP also conducts and coordinates research, evaluation, and data collection on health policy matters. HP works closely with HHS Operating Divisions including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and with the Public Health Service agencies such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Indian Health Service (IHS).</p>
<p>Section 2(d) of the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act of 2014 calls for the HHS Secretary, acting through ASPE, to conduct studies evaluating the effect of individuals' socioeconomic status (SES) on quality measures and measures of resource use under Medicare payment programs. The IMPACT Act requires ASPE to conduct a series of three related research projects, which are being conducted by analysts and researchers in HP. The first component of the required work, referred to in this description as Study A, focuses on socioeconomic information currently available in Medicare data, and specifically mandates a focus on Medicaid eligibility and urban versus rural location. The second component, Study B, expands the analyses by using non-Medicare datasets to quantify SES, and must be completed no later than October 2019 as required by the authorizing legislation. Finally, the Act requires qualitative work to inform and contextualize Studies A and B focusing on data availability and use; which is referred to as Study C. The statute also requires HHS to submit two reports on the studies conducted under IMPACT to Congress no later than 2 years (Report #1) and 5 years (Report #2) after the date of the enactment of the Impact Act.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE.

The NCO 12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 115 S. 84th Street, Suite 101, Milwaukee, WI 53214, is performing market research.  This Sources Sought is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government at this time.  This notice is intended strictly for market research.  The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine interest and capability of potential vendors, including Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned-Small Business (SDVOSB) vendors relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS code) 339112.

Specifications/salient characteristics:

The VA Illiana Healthcare System located in Danville, IL has a need to upgrade the existing Hematak 3000 machine.  This Danville VA Medical Facility needs a Siemens Brand-Name Only Healthineers Hematek 3000 System that can provide all the following salient characteristics.   The Illiana HealthCare system needs a slide stainer that can do all 4 of these things in one: 
It can stain up to 60 slides per hour with minimal user hands on time, which maximizes productivity
User defined stain intensity is consistent which enables high quality differential interpretation
All in one stainpack will stain 900 slides with load and go operation, which maximizes productivity
Incorporates environmentally friendly, sustainable substances which supports  green initiatives 
1)  This is an Upgraded version of our current backup slide stainer (Hematek 2000) which uses the same all-in-one closed stain pack reagent that we currently have and does not require any mixing or pouring of stain and reagents (less messy and can withstand long term storage without needing changed or drying out)   other brands have open containers for stain that have to be wasted and changed daily
2)  Very minimal and quick system maintenance which is necessary since this will be a backup stainer that will need to be put in use quickly when the primary stainer fails 
3)  No additional user/personnel training since once again this is an upgraded system that works the exact same way as the older Hematek 2000 that we have had for over 25 years. 
4)  Slides are immediately ready for viewing after the stain and dry cycle instead of having to wait for the slides to dry in order to read them which does not delay patient testing. 
5)  With the all in one stain pack, all the slides are uniformly stained and the first slide looks just as crisp and clear as the last slide in the stain pack. 
6)  Hands free semi-automated staining with the closed system all-in-one stain pack reagent allows the laboratory technologist to put the slides on and walk away as it stains and collect the slides for reading after they are done.
7) Very quick: can make up to 60 slides an hour which helps us meet our 1 hour stat turn-around-times for Complete Blood Count (CBC) testing with differentials. 
8)  This stainer uses the same reagents and accessories as the slide stainer used in the Peoria CBOC which allows us to share reagents and accessories.

2.  Contract Title. 

Waco Bldg. 90 Air Handler Unit Systems Service and Maintenance 

3.  Background
The Clean Air Act, originally passed in 1973 and amended in 1990, is a United States federal law designed to protect human health and the environment from the effects of air pollution. Indoor air quality (IAQ) problems are not limited to homes.  In fact, many office buildings have significant air pollution sources.  Some of these buildings may be inadequately ventilated.  For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be designed or operated to provide adequate amounts of outdoor air throughout the call center.  People generally have less control over the indoor environment in their offices than they do in their homes.  As a result, there has been an increase in the incidence of reported health problems.  During the course of the last decade Waco Bldg. 90 facility has endured extreme wear and tear on the air handling units.  VHA Member Services has established guidelines to follow on maintenance and operations of facilities to include an air handling unit systems service and maintenance plan to sustain a clean air working environment with higher indoor air quality.  Including in the established goals is the air handler service and maintenance plan that produces with higher quality of indoor air.  By executing the air handler service unit system service and maintenance plan, it will keep Waco Bldg. 90 facilities in good working order offering better indoor air quality for employees and visitors.  The Environment Protection Agency has issued the following statement:  To protect all building occupants and maintain safe and healthy indoor environments, considerations for buildings should include occupant health and well-being, sustainability, energy efficiency, and changing outdoor conditions. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration have offered the following statement:  Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, trouble concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some specific diseases have been linked to specific air contaminants or indoor environments, like asthma with damp indoor environments.  Based on the contents of this paragraph, Waco Bldg. 90 requires an Air Handler Unit Systems Service and Maintenance contract to sustain indoor air quality to foster employee health and well-being, sustainability, energy efficiency, and changing outdoor conditions.

<DESC>The Hines VAMC research service needs a replacement cage and rack washer for its Veterinary Medical Unit (VMU).   This anticipated contract is for the equipment, freight and installation.  The cage and rack washer will sanitize animal cage racks, large cages, carts, specialized rat "condos" and other animal husbandry devices that are too large to fit in the tunnel washer. Sanitization is required to meet Federal regulations and is required to maintain AAALAC accreditation.  The VA has conducted market research to determine that a unit that will meet the VA s need is equipped with an oscillating jet system to provide improved coverage over systems that utilize rotary spray arms or stationary jets. The unit is constructed of stainless steel and has all stainless-steel piping, headers, jets and drain valve. The unit is designed with seam flanges on the exterior of the cabinet in order to eliminate protrusions, bolts, nuts within the chamber, which results in an interior that does not accumulate debris and can be readily cleaned to minimize cross-contamination. The unit is equipped with self-cleaning primary debris screens and an exclusive sump bottom flush that acts to back flush to the drain any debris that settles on the tank floor. The unit also comes equipped with a water hammer eliminator as well as a steam moisture separator that prevents water slugging in the steam supply line. The unit also comes with the capability to either return the acid solution to its reservoir for re-use or dump to drain after neutralization.   Circulating pump has variable frequency drive to vary water output and spray pressure. Operation is controlled through a microprocessor that controls programmable cycles of automatic Operation and comes equipped with a diagnostic program for system calibration and assurance of proper operation.


Other relevant criteria/information
Stainless steel construction (doors, coils, piping, pumps, headers, drain valve, jets, floor grid); flangeless interior cabinet design

<CONTACT>Kim Yen Nguyen Tu, Contracting Specialist, Phone 6123363602, Email kimyen.n.tu@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE NOTIFICATION. USDA APHIS VS INTENDS TO AWARD AN IDIQ CONTRACT TO POSITIVE FEED, INC. SEE JUSTIFICATION BELLOW.</p>
<p>In accordance with the authority granted under FAR Part 13, this request for a noncompetitive acquisition is hereby submitted for consideration for acquisition approval.</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING <br />ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>Requesting Agency:<br />USDA/APHIS/VS/SPRS DISTRICT 4<br />Attn: Purchasing Agent<br />903 San Jacinto Blvd, Rm 220<br />Austin, Texas 78701<br /><br />Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />250 Marquette Ave Suite 410<br />Minneapolis, MN 55401</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING <br />APPROVED:</p>
<p>The USDA APHIS VS Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) was developed to control spread of the Cattle Fever Tick throughout the United States. Currently, a permanent quarantine zone (PQZ) has been developed along the southern Texas border from Del Rio to Brownsville, approximately 600 miles. Currently there are approximately 2450 premises under quarantine compared to 200 premise in 2014. <br /><br />One of the tools utilized by the CFTEP to eliminate fever ticks are Ivermectin medicated molasses tubs. Cattle consume the tubs, which then provides for control and elimination of fever ticks within the herd. The program intends to award a 2 year IDIQ contract to Positive Feed for their Ivermectin treated molasses tubs.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED <br />VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS):</p>
<p>130 lbs. of molasses tubs utilized as supplemental protein, vitamin, and mineral sources for feeding livestock in field conditions. The 130 lbs. plastic tubs contain 30% crude protein, vitamin and mineral supplementation. In addition, 200 mg of Ivermectin, per pound, is then added to the product to aid in Cattle Fever Tick Eradication. The tubs are utilized on high risk premises as deemed necessary by epidemiologists from the CFTEP.</p>
<p>This will be a 2 year IDIQ contract.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING <br />NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS:</p>
<p>The Statutory is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) or 253(c)(2) <br />FAR 6.302-1 when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.</p>
<p>5. QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>A Minimum Use-Major Species Permit was obtained from the FDA for use of this product following a nine month field study. The study, being conducted by CFTEP personnel in south Texas, is evaluating the effectiveness of treating pasture raised cattle ivermectin thru the use of medicated tubs. It is hoped that the delivery of the ivermectin in this manner will provide a positive outcome to treat tick infested cattle in remote areas. Positive Feed Ltd applied for and was granted Investigatory New Animal Drug permit (INAD) number 011-938 by the FDA. This permit allows Positive Feeds, and only this company, to produce for the treated molasses tubs and supply them to the USDA for use in field trials being conducted by the VS Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) in south Texas. INAD permits are issued by the FDA to allow field studies of newly developed drugs for use in field drug trials. Only the holder of the permit, Positive Feed, is allowed to produce the product for field testing.</p>
<p>6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES:</p>
<p>No other offers were solicited. Positive Feeds is the only company holding an FDA permit to manufacture Ivermectin medicated molasses tubs.</p>
<p>7. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE <br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND <br />REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FORTHAT DETERMINATION:</p>
<p>The cost of the treated tubs is currently $130per tub while the cost of an untreated molasses tub with the same make-up is $105.00 per tub. Positive Feeds has provided pricing for a 2 year contract. <br /><br />This price is considered fair and reasonable. There is no public market for the treated tubs at this moment.</p>
<p>8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR <br />PART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON <br />MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:</p>
<p>As Positive Feeds is the only company with an FDA license to manufacture the product, market research was not performed.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL <br />AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):</p>
<p>No other companies hold an FDA license for manufacture of Ivermectin treated molasses tubs. This product is for use only by the CFTEP.</p>
<p>10. A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN <br />INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITON:</p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p>11. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY. THE AGENCY MAY TAKE <br />TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION <br />BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES, <br />EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES REQUIRED:</p>
<p>Any interested firms can apply with FDA for the Investigatory New Animal Drug permit (INAD) to make treated molasses tubs. Program can seek out any firms who may be interested if the need for treated molasses tubs continue to increase.</p>

<p>Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) has a requirement to procure Preventive Maintenance for the StealthStation S7 (Medtronic's seventh generation) Surgical Navigation System. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government intends to procure this item on a sole source basis from Medtronic Inc., the manufacturer of this equipment. Only Medtronic Inc. can provide the required service because it owns the proprietary schematics diagrams, software and spare parts required for maintenance. Also, only it possesses the proprietary troubleshooting tools required to analyze and assess performance problems. Further, required repairs can only be performed by manufacturer's factory trained and certified technicians. Lastly, no other vendor could perform the work because of the prospective liability issues involved if the repairs were done improperly and any existing warranties on the equipment would be voided. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations and a solicitation for this requirement will not be issued. Prospective offerors are advised that, because there are no other known sources, the agency has authorized the procurement of this item under the full and open competition under FAR 6.3. However, interested responsible sources may submit a capability statement for the agency's consideration in determining whether a competitive procurement should be conducted in the future for this item.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the Justification and Approval will be posted no later than 14 days after contract award.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT
<p>The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SeaGIS Pty. Ltd.; PO Box 1085, Bacchus Marsh VIC, 3340, Australia, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, to provide measurement and analysis software, called EventMeasure. The SeaGIS software is to be used at the NOAA Fisheries, Mississippi Laboratories (MS Labs) in Pascagoula, MS. MS Labs have used VMS Software to make non-contact estimates of fish lengths since 2008. The stereo measurement functionality of VMS is no longer being updated, soon resulting in non-compatibility with computer operation systems used by NOAA. MS Labs personnel have known the developer of VMS for many years and he has recommended a transition to SeaGIS software. Use of a temporary demonstration license provided by SeaGIS for the requested software showed that it meets the needs of MS Labs better than the software currently used and labor required to perform camera calibration would be significantly decreased in comparison to the current method. The proposed software package produced by, and only available from, SeaGIS Pty. Ltd., consists of a module called EventMeasure (Stereo) used for event logging, length measurement, and statistical analysis. SeaGIS Software is only licensed and sold directly from SeaGIS Pty. Ltd. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 541511 with a business size standard of $27.5M. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 11:00 AM, March 16, 2018. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required supplies. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be e-mailed to Lauren.Kurtz@noaa.gov by 11:00 AM, March 16, 2018.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE-SOURCE CONTRACT<br />The US Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Simplified Acquisition Branch intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (for a Base and Three Option Year Contract) with SCALGO Aps, Aabogade 40D, Aarhus N, 8200 Denmark, using the procedures in FAR Part 13, and in reference to 41.U.S.C. 253(c)(1), to provide SCALGO Nautical Software and Maintenance for use by the National Ocean Services (NOS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS) in production of NOAA nautical charts and the collection of nautical data information.
<p>The SCALGO (Scalable Algorithmics) Nautical software processes large and detailed bathymetric data into contours and sounding that are cartographically acceptable for the nautical chart domain. The software uses a simplification 2D versus 3D process that removes details unimportant for navigational overview while at the same time guaranteeing certain properties that are critical for chart correctness and navigational safety. SCALGO Nautical is unique in that it does not simplify the bathymetric surface but instead simplifies the contours and soundings directly, i.e. the algorithms modify the chart directly instead of indirectly via the surface. This allows for input parameters and output quality guarantees that are directly related to what the cartographers sees on the map, e.g. minimum distance between contours or minimum size of contours. This integrated suite of programs in hydrography and cartography helps protect life and property, supports economic growth and development, and protects the environment, in addition to the overall mission of promoting safe navigation.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), Only one responsible source.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 511210, Software Publishers, with a business size standard of $38.5 Million. This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, if any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities, which if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. A statement of capabilities must be received by 11:00am, March 28, 2018. Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required services. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to increase the ceiling of Contract N66001-15-C-4065 to Stealth Software Technologies, Inc. (Stealth Software), awarded by SSC Pacific on behalf of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Information Innovation Office (DARPA I2O) on 6 August 2015 for a 54-month period of performance.  The effort under the contract supports the DARPA I2O Brandeis program and proposes to develop scalable and efficient privacy-preserving computation techniques and technologies.  The focus of Stealth Softwares efforts to date has been in building a secure and private data repository allowing secure, privacy-preserving computation on encrypted data using Distributed Point Functions/Function Secret Sharing and Secure Multiparty Computation.  Stealth Software proposes using their cryptographic expertise to develop a secure method of viewing private information through commodity computer screens and glasses.  This added effort will aid in the development and transition by demonstrating the efficiency and scalability of Stealth Softwares privacy-preserving computation technologies on realistic dataset and in realistic application environments.  It will allow for the research and engineering of more effective methods of computation on privacy-sensitive information for secure transmission of private information between a computer and a human end-user.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541715- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  Due to the nature of Research and Development efforts, DARPA could not have reasonably estimated the results of the research from this program and/or the need for additional research under this program.  This action includes a ceiling increase of approximately $342,904.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes, however, interested parties may submit comments in writing to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Lynn Biedermann, Code 22530, SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, who may be reached by telephone at (619) 553-4479 or via email to lynn.biedermann@navy.mil.  This notice will be posted for 15 days.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>PLA SYNOPSIS:<br />The Fort Worth District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements, (PLAs), for a large scale construction contract, (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:
<p>Project Description: Lewisville Dam Safety Modification</p>
<p>Project Location: Lewisville, Texas</p>
<p>Summary: Construction services required include DBB Construction of collection systems, drilled piers and inverted filter berms will require relocation of a municipal water line and a robust dewatering system capable of functioning in expansive soils. At conservation pool elevation, measured seepage ranges from a few gallons per minute (gpm) up to 80 gpm depending on the area. Seepage increases as the pool elevation rises during storage of flood waters. Once the confining clay cap is penetrated, this dewatering system must be able to provide a safe, stable work space during construction as well as ensure the continued integrity of the earthen embankment until the collection system and inverted filter berm are fully functional. The contractor must show experience in installing and managing such systems with varying pool elevations.</p>
<p>DFAR 236.204 Disclosure of the magnitude of construction projects. Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.</p>
<p>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy Subpart 22.503:</p>
<p>a.) Project Labor Agreement, (PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>b.) An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:</p>
<p>1.) Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...</p>
<p>2.) Be consistent with law.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a.) The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br />b.) The complexity of the project.<br />c.) Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />d.) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br />e.) The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />f.) The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />g.) The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. h.) Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>Please reference FAR Provision: 52.222-33 "Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement" and FAR Clause: 52.222-34 Alternate I (May 2010) "Project Labor Agreements."</p>
<p>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a.) Should PLA's be executed on this selected large dollar contract in Lewisville, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?</p>
<p>b.) Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p>c.) Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d.) Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e.) Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f.) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g.) Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h.) Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the Lewisville, Texas area?</p>
<p>i.) Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential Offerors and/or subcontractors to meet their Small Business utilization goals?</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">AS9100 Revision D, certification is required by WR-ALC OI 63-501, Quality Management Manual, and many public-private partnership agreements with aerospace manufacturers. To maintain the WRALC AS9100 Revision D certification, WR-ALC must fulfill the requirements of clause 4.1, the context of the organization. The requirement must be met no later than July 2018, that is, prior to our recertification audit (scheduled for August 2018) to allow our maintenance groups time to prepare the workforce and address any issues. Context of the organization is determined through standard business analyses. MERC engineers, computer scientists, mathematicians, logisticians, and scientists provide support defined by the Robins mission partners as essential engineering and research and development skills. MERC has 30+ years experience with Robins AFB Depot Maintenance. Their knowledge and familiarity with Robins AFB allows MERC to immediately step in and perform all the required analysis services. A few of their recent applicable contracts were FA8530-17-D-0001, FA8509-12-G-0001 and FA8501-17-C-0012. If another company was brought in then it would take a minimum of 6 months to get that company up to speed with our requirements and understanding of the complex. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">In September 2017, the particular requirement from AS9100 was newly added in Rev D and not known. This procurement must be awarded and completed prior to July 2018 to ensure that the August 2018 recertification audit does not result in adverse action against WR-ALC's certificate. Any adverse action could lead to a lapse in certification, which could jeopardize public-private partnership agreements. Many large companies like Boeing, Northrop Grumman and L3 require Robins AFB to be AS9100 certified. If this </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11.5pt">contract is not awarded before the audit it will be a major finding and Robins AFB will lose its accredidation. Robins AFB would then lose around $300M in workload from these major companies. 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2), as implemented by FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency, Mercer University is the only company capable of performing these services quickly (interviews, charts and analysis) before the August audit and losing a large financial workload</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>The commissioning of a Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force (Task Force) is required by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) as part of the process when considering a state government's request to lethally remove those pinnipeds that are having a significant negative impact on at-risk populations of salmon and steelhead. The State of Oregon has declared that pinnipeds in the vicinity of Willamette Falls, Oregon are having a significant negative impact on at-risk populations of salmon and steelhead. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) requires a professional, impartial facilitation team to help manage the Task Force due to the controversial nature of the discussions. The Act requires that the Task Force be convened to review the state's application, review the public comments on the state's application, and to provide NMFS with a recommendation to either approve or deny the state's request.</p>
<p>NMFS is preparing to convene the Task Force in 2018 to evaluate the state's request, and expects these session meetings to be limited to no more than three days and to be held off-site.</p>
<p>NMFS' West coast Regional Office (WCR) is seeking to award a firm-fixed price, non-severable purchase order to convene a Task Force to evaluate the state of Oregon's 2017 MMPA Section 120 application to remove predatory pinnipeds that prey on Endangered Species Act-listed salmonids in the vicinity of Willamette Falls.</p>
<p>Oversee Public Meetings and Deliberations of the Willamette Falls Pinniped-Fishery Interaction Task Force, and provide NMFS with a Task Force report and Task Force recommendations.</p>

<p>Depuy Sigma Total Knee System is a unique system comprised of unicondylar and patellofemoral implants and a full range of state-of-the-art instruments to perform both of these procedures. The system's implants are designed to treat degenerative joint disease one compartment at a time: medial uni, lateral uni and patellofemoral. This allows the surgeon to replace only the affected compartment, leaving healthy bone, cartilage and ligaments intact. The modularity of the system addresses one of the main reasons for early intervention revision, disease progression. Because of the ability to maintain the ACL with this system, normal kinematics in activities of daily living can be achieved.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W91YTZ&#8208;18&#8208;T&#8208;0176 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005&#8208;92 and Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement Publication (DPN) 20161104.
<p>This acquisition is issued on an UNRESTRICTED basis under NAICS code 339113 and size standard is 750. The Government anticipates awarding a single award issued as Firm Fixed Price. The requirement of this solicitation is to provide a Zepto Precision Pulse Capsulotomy System at Winn Army Community Hospital, Fort Stewart, GA.</p>
<p>Quotes are due by March 16, 2018 at 12:00 pm EST. Questions must be submitted via email no later than March 15, 2018. Quotes and questions shall be submitted via email to deneith.graves.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p><br />Depuy Orthopedics carries the Pinnacle Acetabular cup system, which provides sizes 38mm - 72mm both Titanium gripton and Titanium porocoat, multihole, and revision cup capabilities. The Altex liners that are used with this system provides the option of neutral, neutral+ 4, per degree +4 and constrained liners to provide maximum stability. The Depuy hip system provides options for the following different hip stems which include the Summit, Trilock, solution, AML, and reclaim. The Depuy system includes head sizes from 22mm to 40mm in both ceramic and metal options.</p>
<p>The CORAIL Hip System offers five different primary stems and a cemented stem. The design of the extra medullary section improves the biomechanics of the stem. The low profile neck increases the range of motion of the stem within the cup before the neck impinges on the cup. The AMT taper (ARTICUL/EZE Mini Taper) captures completely the femoral head reducing the potential for impingement of the cup. The CORAIL stem has a propriety HA coating on the grit-blasted surface. The HA coated medial to lateral taper resists axial / torsional stresses and promotes osteointegration for optimum fixation. The design of the CO RAIL stem, with its titanium alloy and its full hydroxyapatite coating ensures load transfer without abnormal peak forces and allows a very low incidence of thigh pain.</p>

<p><br />Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a Firm Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the item(s) offered to meet the Government requirement. Offeror compliance with meeting or exceeding salient characteristics, responses to SOW specific tasks, meeting the SOW Information Technology Connectivity, ease of use, training and special features that represents the best value to the Government. During the evaluation of quotes, offeror must be determined to be acceptable by meeting minimum salient characteristics before other technical factors shall be considered.</p>
<p>Minimum salient characteristics:<br />1. Analyzers shall be FDA approved, 100-240V +/- 10%, use FDA approved software for FDA approved testing reagents.</p>
<p>2. Reagent kits must be FDA approved for use in clinical testing with expiration dates no less than 6 months of delivery date that function properly and pass lot to lot testing as required.</p>
<p>3. Operating system must be capable with Windows 10 or higher.</p>
<p>4. Automated QC cartridge with three levels (low, medium and high) controls.</p>
<p>5. Traditional external QC with three levels (low, medium and high) controls.</p>
<p>6. Electrodes, gas, and reagents are self-contained as one unit</p>
<p>7. Random access, continuous operation, remote access and STAT test capability.</p>
<p>8. Barcode Reader and disk drive with read and write and USB port for loading and downloading data</p>

<p>12. No direct plumb or modification of facility for water source for operation or waste drain.</p>
<p>13. Must interface with the DoD Electronic Health Record system.</p>
<p>(ii) Price: Will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and price reasonableness. The offeror shall complete the CLIN structure with a total price covering a base period and one option year developed based upon the annual testing requirement.</p>
<p>Technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price when compared.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Award may be made without discussions with offerors (except communications conducted for the purpose of minor clarification). Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695
