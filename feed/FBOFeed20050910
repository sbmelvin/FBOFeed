The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical is more important than Past Perform ance.  Technical and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  All offers will initially be reviewed to determine responsiveness to the solicitation.  TECHNICAL:  The Government will then evaluate the offerors Technical  approach to determine if the approach outlined by the offeror meets the minimum Government requirements outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation, including but not limited to, proposed system hardware and software, system configuration and offered t echnical solution, and the offerors proposed  implementation.

The Government reserves the right to award a contr act to other than the lowest priced offeror if that offeror is not technically acceptable, or is judged to have less than satisfactory past performance, based on the information gathered through the questionnaires and other Government and commercial source s, as discussed above.
