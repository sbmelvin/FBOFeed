The work is being performed for the USGS Global Dust Project to understand the effects of African dust air masses on downwind ecosystems and human health.  It is essential to identify and quantify the contaminants so that the toxicity of aerosols as well as the vapor phase of air masses can be tested against marine organisms.  The data will be used by USGS at external professional meetings and in scientific publications associated with the Global Dust investigations.  The work requires a state-of-the-art pesticide analytical laboratory and experience in developing methods for analysis of persistent organic pollutants.  Consistency in data sampling is essential to maintaining the integrity of the Project.  Timeliness is also a factor for ensuring data integrity.  THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is April 19, 2006, under the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.00.  NAICS is 541990.

<ARCHDATE>04122007
<CONTACT>Barbara Taylor Contract Specialist 8015243750 ;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a construction contract to overlay the Deer Creek Dam Spillway Chute with a reinforced concrete slab.  Deer Creek Dam is a zoned earth and rockfill embankment with a strutural height of 235 feet and a crest length of 1,304 feet.  It impounds the 152,700 acre Deer Creek Reservoir, a source of culinary, municipal, and irrigation water for both Salt Lake and Utah Counties.  The dam's 700-foot long reinforced concrete spillway is located on the right abutment and is controlled by two 21-foot wide by 20-foot high radial gates. The principal features of the work include the following: 1.  Construction of a reinforced concrete overlay within the spillway chute. 2.  Installation of grouted anchors and dowels in the chute floor slabs and walls. 3.  Installation of hydrophilic and PVC waterstops at concrete joints. 4.  Preparation of existing concrete surfaces to accept concrete overlay. 5.  Removal of existing concrete at upstream and downstream ends of overlay. 6.  Unwatering spillway chute and stilling basin to allow placement of concrete overlay. 7.  Construct and remove downstream cofferdam.  Cleaning and removal of debris from stilling basin. Critical items of work include placing a large quantity of concrete to strict Reclamation standards, and effectively removing seepage water from the stilling basin.  A site tour will be announced in the Solicitation.  While Reclamation plans to award the contract late in the summer of 2006, the actual work will be performed between June (immediately following spring runoff) and October of 2007.  The solicitation falls within the estimated price range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 238110, and will be solicited as full and open competition.   Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR wersite, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<SUBJECT>66--66--NOTICE OF INTENT to issue a single source award to Hach Environmental for the upgrade of Hydrolab data sondes from model 4as to model 5s
<SOLNBR>101816q135
<RESPDATE>041406
<ARCHDATE>04122007
<CONTACT>Frank Lee Contract Specialist 5038722788     frank_lee@fws.gov;
<DESC>This purchase is for modification of ten Hydrolab multiprobe (Model 4A) manufactured by Hach Environmental (formerly Hydrolab). The modification of each of these instruments would include: a new dissolved oxygen sensor, which is more reliable (LDO technology) than the probes we used in the past, new electronics (daughter card and MPL board), conductivity and pH sensors, a new housing and labor.  Repair and upgrading the instruments will permit collection of high quality data in the years to follow.  These instruments will be used in water quality investigations in Salmon Creek and the Klamath and Mattole Rivers during the summer of 2006. We have been using Hydrolab instrumentations for five years counting.  During this time, the instrumentation provided adequate service but are showing considerable wear and tear from the continuous service.  Recent evaluations of these instruments have revealed many problems including faulty probes and other miscellaneous problems that have resulted in the instruments becoming unreliable.  The modification of these instruments to include more contemporary technologies and new probes will again allow for our ability to collect high quality data. We are requesting authorization to modify ten Hydrolab (Model 4A) to essentially become the equivalent of the Model 5 at a cost of approximately $3,016 per instrument for a total of $ 30,160. The price of ten new multiprobe instruments (Model 5) from Hach would be approximately $4,246 each for total of $42,460. Modifying our existing instrumentation, rather than purchase of new instrumentation, results in a cost savings of approximately $12,000 while attaining instrumentation with similar specifications to the new instruments.  Purchase of new instrumentation of similar capability from another company would cost approximately $43,000, which is ~ 12,000 greater than having the existing equipment modified by Hach. Multiprobe instrumentation are custom-built devices and each manufacturer uses specific hardware and proprietary software to operate their equipment.  Hach Environmental considers their instrumentation and associated software to be proprietary.  Thus any modification to the instrumentation should be performed by Hach Environmental Company.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) anticipates a cost plus award fee contract in support of CMS’ Chronic Care Improvement-Information Management System (CCI-IMS).  This existing system supports the activities of the Chronic Care Improvement Programs.  This program provides for a disease management pilot program.  The CCI-IMS supports all facets of the program, including storing claims, eligibility/enrollment, participation, audit, payment, performance, and other data.  Additionally, it provides for a robust reporting system.  The CCI-IMS is a relational database system, compliant with CMS architecture, which resides on the Medicare Data Communications Network. 

If CMS decides to issue a request for proposal, it will be an 8(a) set-aside. Please note that an approved accounting system is necessary for bidding on a cost type contract.

In an attempt to improve the understanding of the CCI-IMS requirements, to allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and to increase efficiency in proposal preparation, CMS is releasing the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) for this effort with this announcement.  Attached is a copy of the Draft SOW CMS anticipates incorporating into the Request for Proposal (RFP).  

CMS anticipates a November 28, 2005 solicitation release for a Cost Plus Award Fee contract with an approximate two week transition period, a base year and four (4), one-year (1) option periods.  Again, this is an 8(a) SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE for which only 8(a) Small Business Concerns will be eligible to participate.  
Any questions should be directed to Ms. Gina Romano, Contract Specialist, 410-786-8645, or via e-mail at Gina.Romano@cms.hhs.gov.  E-mail communications should include company name, type of small business, address, point of contact, phone and fax numbers.  Any additional information and documents on this requirement will be posted to FedBizOpps.

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  
THIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. 
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  
NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.   
RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION.

Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination  of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency intends to award a sole source cost reimburseable Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to Interstate Electronics Corporation (IEC) located in Anaheim, California.  Under this contract IEC will continue to provide Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking hardware and related support for Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) testing.  The effort requires the contractor to: (1) provide mission support to the Translated Global Positioning System (GPS) Range System (TGRS), (2) procure test equipment including Digital Global Positioning Systems Translators (DGTs), GPS Translator Processors (GTPs) and satellite constellation simulators compatible with TGRS technology, and (3) provide system upgrades, spares, and operation and maintenance repairs.  IEC has been a participant in the performance of the National Missile Defense GPS Ballistic Missile Translators (BMTs) and associated Translator Processing System (TPS) since 1987.  IEC competitively won the initial contract for the design and development of the first generation BMTs and TPSs equipment.  The TGRS obtains GPS Time, Space and Position Information (TSPI), and provides independent tracking data for both interceptor and target vehicles.  The TGRS provides this information using signals from the GPS space vehicles.  TGRS provides for real time line-of-sight tracking and recording of high quality pre-track GPS signals for enhanced post flight trajectory reconstruction for GMD tests involving intercept and kinetic kill impact of a target vehicle.  Furthermore, the technical data package for TGRS products, is proprietary to IEC.  IEC holds the essential information to successfully provide system engineering and mission support services by responding to urgent, short suspense technical difficulties and providing the TGRS resident expert and design engineer.  IEC is the only manufacturer of both GTPs and DGTs.  Given the 18-month lead time of these items, and tight test schedule, MDA must ensure that range assets necessary for program testing are produced and in place in accordance with program requirements and schedules.  Any significant delays in obtaining TGRS support would mean program test requirements and schedules would not be met.  The anticipated award date for this contract is August 15, 2006.

<DESC>The Republic of Turkey intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement and installation of the hardware and software needed to extend the Bi-SC AIS Core Software to the NATO Unclassified Network in Turkey.

The Republic of Turkey is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. 

The estimated value of this project will not be disclosed at this time. The Host Nation believes that disclosure of the budget information to prospective bidders may be detrimental to the execution of fair competition.

The Host Nation intends to use the basic (one step/two envelopes) ICB procedure. Contractor selection will be based on the lowest compliant bid. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is AC/4-DS(2005)11,12. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the IFB reference IFB-TURKEY-AC4-DS-2005.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Under this project, a Local Area Network will be established at CC Air South, Izmir with remote access from NCSA Sector, Disko Hit (Izmir) and NCSA Squadron, Ankara. An ADP environment will be created at each NATO site. The hardware and software will comply with ACE ACCIS aspects. The following components will be procured:

- HP and GP servers
- Workstations
- Laptops
- Medium and small routers
- Very large, large and small IP switches
- Network printers, B&W
- Network printers, color laser
- Scanners
- Fiber optic cabling
- LAN/WAN components
- Firewall
- Docking stations
- Various software: 
   - SAN Package Software
   - Switch Software
   - Large Switch Software
   - HP Open View (or equivalent)

Besides the ICB Procedure for the procurement of the above software and hardware, the Host Nation will apply the following procurement method:

 - For software products for which Enterprise Agreements exist - directed procurement to the Enterprise Agreement Contractor.

 - For the security authentication capability, which must be the same product at all sites, directed procurement to the winner of the competition for the NC3A project.

The hardware and software procurement includes documentation and initial spares. The installation includes initial training for support staff and contractor support for the early months of system operation.

Under this project, the current NATO Unclassified (NU) infrastructure will be strengthened and modernized. The current software baseline will be enhanced and migrated to a Windows 2000 environment. Web services, Email services, Security services, Office Automation and Management Services will be provided to a common design using common software products.

Internet access will continue to be implemented via a local Internet Provider as its is today. Additional security services such as Intrusion Detection, Firewall and Authentication using tokens will be implemented to protect NATO users from other Internet users.

The generic design implemented under this project will only support information exchange at the NU RTI level. NATO has Functional Services, which need to access outside organizations via the Internet but which process information up to NATO RESTRICTED.

All of the Hardware and Software to be procured and installed under this project are Commercial Off-the-Shelf products configured by parameter setting to NATO use. There is no software development or modification of any kind.

The contractor will be responsible for the provision, installation, configuration and integration of each NATO site. The contractor will also be responsible for providing Operation and Maintenance (O&M) for a period of 5 years after approval of Provisional Site Acceptance (PSA).

The IFB package will not contain material of a classified nature. However, prospective bidders should be aware that contractor personnel will be called on to work at NATO sites and will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET. All such clearances must be in place prior to the contract award.

<DESC>The National Park Service, Southern Arizona Office (SOAR), 3115 N. 3rd Avenue, Suite 101, Phoenix, AZ. 85013-4334 (602) 640-5250 seeks a qualified firm, or Group (s) with expertise in surveying, planimetric mapping, photogrammetrical mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), 3D laser scanning of artifacts and archeological sites, 3D modeling and computer animation to be performed in the state of Arizona.  The Government intends to award a single task order contract under this solicitation.  The Government will use such factors as experience, past performance, quality of deliverables, timeliness, or other factors that the Contracting Officer, in exercise of sound business judgment, believes are relevant to the placement of orders. The selected team shall primarily specialize in Ground Penetrating Radar Investigation (GPR)/Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), 3D LIDAR scanning of artifacts, 3D LIDAR and computer modeling of historic and prehistoric archeological sites, Architectural sheets, Architectural Digital Photography, Computer animation for interpretive purposes with secondary emphasis in surveys, aerial photography and aerial photogrammetrical mapping, global positioning surveys (GPS), planimetric mapping, Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  The proposed work may extend over fiscal years involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants and/or NPS professionals.  The A/E will need to have direct contact with federal, state or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  Specific tasks of the contract may include: Surveying Surveying may include identifying the defining features of existing infrastructure (such as roads, trails, buildings, utility systems, fences, earthworks, etc), resources (historic and prehistoric sites, significant natural resources), park boundaries, and other features (monitoring plots and stations) to an accuracy of less than 1 meter for inclusion in GIS layers.    Hydrologic surveys may involve stream meander profiles, identification of various flood plain elevations, drainage structures, and erosion problems.  Technical assistance may include survey software conversion, survey data compilation, and database implementation.  The disciplines required include professional surveyors, photogrammetrists, and supporting technical personnel. Aerial photography and aerial photogrammetrical mapping Aerial photography and aerial topographic mapping work may involve obtaining aerial photography (film and digital), identifying and establishing panel paints, establishing survey control and providing data electronically formatted in the current AutoCAD and ArcGIS formats.  Mapping may include obtaining color stereo aerial photography of lands and photogrammetrically-produced topography (1 m contour intervals). Global Positioning System (GPS) Surveys  GPS surveys may include high accuracy control networks; real time kinematic surveys; locating park infrastructure or resources to an accuracy range of 5 to 1 meters, depending on the requirements of the application involved.  Survey may include establishing accurate UTM coordinates and sea level elevation for survey control including establishing datums for current and future mapping, monitoring, documentation, or development needs; surveying the location of all existing, identifiable datums used by previous researchers conducting excavations or other investigations at or near the identified study areas; surveying 3D LIDAR targets and GPR baselines.   Survey may involve the use of RTK-GPS and geodetic survey methods by experienced, licensed, professional surveyors to establish accurate UTM coordinates and sea-level referenced elevations for permanent datums.  Planimetric mapping Planimetric mapping may include plotting all modern, historic or prehistoric structures, trails, signs, roads, utilities, etc.; digital ortho-rectified image of lands, and digital 2D cartographic files. Maps may be produced (in color and B/W) showing various scales of topography, location of GPR and LIDAR projects, location of GPR baselines and GPR and topographic anomalies.  Mapping may involve the production of several maps depicting numerous structural stories/levels of archeological sites.  Planimetric maps may consist of 2D digital vector data and hardcopy images of archeological sites with 10 cm (or finer) topography, wall tops and wall bases, wall features, and other archaeological features located by a professional archeologist. Hardcopy maps may be produced at various scales to identify all features adequately. Mapping may also include digital vector and hardcopy (map) versions of archeological site profiles.  Ground Penetrating Radar Investigation (GPR)/ Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) technology may include survey methods by professional, geophysical survey staff having extensive experience in archaeologically-related GPR surveys and interpretation to survey, identify and locate subsurface archaeological features. Identification of subsurface features may involve interpretation of GPR anomalies to specify size, depth, thickness, and possible feature types for identified anomalies.  GPR survey may involve the use of high-resolution 3D LIDAR scanning of project areas.  LIDAR scanning may be used to produce fine-scale topographic information (2-5 cm topographic contours, or a finer scale deemed necessary) that may assist in the identification of subsurface features located by GPR.  LIDAR scan data may be used to produce 3D TIN models for projects to allow topographic correction of GPR data and may include complete reduction of scan data including scan cleaning, registration, and TIN or DEM creation, and production of contours as needed to identify surface anomalies related to surface and subsurface archaeological features. The contour data may be used to produce a base map (both digital and hardcopy) onto which GPR interpretations will be integrated.  Geographic Information Systems (GIS) GIS may involve incorporating all surveying, LIDAR scanning, mapping, and GPR data and results into an integrated GIS system.  This may involve integrating data into an ArcGIS geodatabase. All digital graphical mapping data may require linking to various photogrammetry, 3D models, databases, and GPR data already existing.  This task may include training park staff on GIS use on a current copy of ESRI ARCView 9.0 or equivalent. 3D LIDAR scanning of artifacts 3D laser (LIDAR) scanning of artifacts may involve the scanning of selected archaeological artifacts such as ceramic vessels, stone artifacts, and selected perishable materials for production of a 3D graphical database of selected artifacts. This database may be established and available for scientific research, as well as for archival documentation, park reference, animation use, and may be prepared for web-based access.  GIS database links may be created for each 3D model and hard copy.  "Rollout sheets" may be created for each appropriate artifact (generally ceramic jars, certain stone artifacts) to identify stylistic attributes. 3D LIDAR and computer modeling of historic and prehistoric archeological sites LIDAR may involve high-resolution 3D scanning of archeological sites, ground surface and caves or alcoves in which sites are located.  LIDAR may be geo-referenced so that data produced from this effort may be placed into park service coordinate systems to allow integration with previously produced GIS data.  LIDAR Resolution may vary from 1 to 2 cm scan resolution for the caves or topographic exterior areas to 1 mm for archeological sites and features.  Computer models may be created from LIDAR scans and should contain the smallest model error possible based on registration and survey error.  Acceptable ranges of model error will be determined by the Government on a site by site basis due to the ranging complexity of archaeological sites.  LIDAR scanned data may be used to produce 3D TIN models for use in projects and in the development of planimetric maps and architectural sheets.  Architectural sheets Architectural sheets involve the production of scaled architectural computer generated drawings of previously LIDAR scanned architecture. Architectural sheets may consist of 2D digital and hardcopy images of the color photography, color-corrected, mosaic, draped, and rectified onto high-resolution 3D models, so that future measurements and documentation can be superimposed on the images. Architectural sheets may include vector line versions of wall maps showing wall profiles, outlines of individual wall rocks, and identified wall features for use in CAD or GIS programs. Architectural sheets may include "ground-truthing" of each individual wall face and wall top to complete architectural feature identifications and verify interpreted features on architectural sheets prior to their final production. Architectural Digital Photography Digital photography may involve acquiring a minimum of 8MP digital color photography of architectural structures to allow the creation of architectural sheets or for use in architectural reconstructions and animations.  Photography must be conducted by a highly experienced professional photographer with a background in documentation photography and an assistant. Photography may depict each wall face and wall top in a structure in a series of overlapping photographs.  Photography may be taken to allow the production of a professional quality animation of archeological ruins and the local environment.  Photographs may be referenced to an electronic photo-log sorted by room and wall.  Computer animation for interpretive purposes  Computer animation may involve the production of exhibits which give the viewer the perception of motion through or around a structure, the perception of motion of an artifact, the perception of changes to the structure or resource through elapsed time, or changes to a landscape through elapsed time.  Animations would be intended for use at park visitor centers and/or on park web sites to present visitors/viewers with detailed views of the interiors and exteriors of archeological sites and to help tell stories about them, their inhabitants, and the environment in which they lived. Animations may require additional photography.  Animations may include additional components such as sound and on-screen text. Metadata All spatial data set deliverables will require metadata that meets the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM).  Non-spatial tabular and database deliverables will also require metadata.  Metadata must be provided in XML file format. The term of the contract shall be one year with two one-year options.  The A/E prime awarded a contract is guaranteed a minimum of $50,000 during the life of the contract.  The total of all work over the life of the contract will not exceed $1,000,000 and each task order will not exceed $500,000.  The policies and directives of the agency for which the work will be performed will guide the work.   The following criteria, in descending order of importance, shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms: 1.	Demonstrated professional experience and technical competence of the firm, including its subconsultants, with various types of services described above with emphasis in GPR and LIDAR.  Special consideration will be given to firms whose recent surveying, mapping and animation services demonstrate sensitivity to natural, cultural and prehistoric/historic sites and features in the Southwest. 2.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Surgery Branch, plans to procure on a sole source basis, services for the Development of p53 TCR lentiviral vectors with Lentigen Corporation, 1450 South Rolling Road, Suite 4.049, Baltimore, MD 21075.

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisitions.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

p53 TCR lentiviral vectors has been extensively studied as a potential target for cancer therapy because it is mutated in approximately half of all human cancers, leading to a prolonged protein half-life and subsequent over-expression. Additionally, mutant p53 is thought to have a dominant transforming function in vivo, resulting in selection pressure to maintain its expression throughout tumor growth.  NCI shall develop lentiviral vectors that can be used to engineer primary human T lymphocytes to express a murine anti-human p53 T-cell receptor, which can both recognize and be able to kill p53-expressing human tumors.

The unique ability of lentiviral vectors to transduce human nondividing cells stably and efficiently without expressing immunogenic viral components is a tremendous asset for gene therapy.  Like their gammaretrovirus-based predecessors, lentiviral vectors integrate their cargo into the chromosomes of target cells without transferring virus-derived coding sequences.  Lentiviral vectors can mediate this process in nondividing cells, which is a great asset for many experimental and clinical situations. 

Lentigen has the unique technology and expertise to produce lentiviral vectors containing NCI anti-p53 TCRs.  The unique ability of the lentiviral vectors is to transduce human non-dividing cells stably and efficiently without expressing immunogenic viral components.  Lentiviral vectors integrate their cargo into the chromosomes of target cells without transferring virus-derived coding sequences.  Lentigen Corporation is the only known source that can develop lentiviral vectors containing NCI anti-p53 with the unique ability to transduce human non-dividing cells stably and efficiently without expressing immunogenic viral components.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Division of Child and Family Development, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management has a requirement to conduct the work necessary to continue the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW).  NSCAW is the first nationally representative, longitudinal study to examine in detail the outcomes for those children and families that come into contact with the child welfare system and to identify key variables that contribute to those outcomes.  Currently, the NSCAW project is being conducted through a contract to RTI International; begun in 1997, the project has conducted four waves of data collection from a sample of 5501 children, drawn from 92 primary sampling units (PSUs) across the U.S.,  who were the subjects of investigation by Child Protective Services between late 1999 and early 2001 for reports of maltreatment.   An additional sample of 727 children was selected from those who had been in foster care for one year during the sample enrollment period, in the same PSUs.  Data were collected at baseline and at three follow-up waves (12 months, 18 months, and 36 months post-investigation).  A fifth wave of data collection will be completed in 2006.  Further information about the NSCAW project can be found at http://www.acf.dhhs.gov/programs/opre/abuse_neglect/nscaw/index.html . 

The NSCAW work will be conducted over a five-year period.  The contractor is expected to manage all aspects of the study, including completing the study design, defining the sample, defining constructs and measures, preparing documents for obtaining approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for data collection, obtaining approvals from internal and external Internal Review Boards (IRBs), and assessing the feasibility of proposed field work strategies.  The contractor shall complete preparations for field work (including obtaining cooperation from 100 local child welfare agencies for participation and training an extensive field staff), recruit and train field staff, locate families, obtain informed consent, and conduct data collection.  The contractor shall be responsible for locating and tracking a national sample of approximately 5000-6000 children over the course of the study’s designated time period using a variety of data collection methods and will revise the design and measures as appropriate at each data collection point, complete data analyses, and prepare the data from each data collection for archiving as public use data sets.  Data analysis will include state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, and survival models.  The contractor shall report their findings to policy, science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings.

The contract will require longitudinal data collection from (1) children in the child welfare system, (2) their caregivers, (3) their caseworkers, (4) other agency personnel, and (5) review of administrative records.  It is expected that at a minimum, two rounds of face-to-face interviews will be conducted with children, caregivers, and caseworkers.  In addition to interviews, standardized assessments of educational, emotional, behavioral, and social functioning will be conducted with children.  Data may also be collected from schools and from service providers outside the child welfare system.  In addition to the face-to-face interviews noted above, other activities may be used as supplements to the interview data or to facilitate data collection at more frequent intervals (including telephone follow-ups, mailed questionnaires, record reviews).  Careful tracking of families and children over time to minimize attrition is an essential component for the success of this study.

Participating children and families will be those who have had contact with the child welfare system (i.e., upon investigation of abuse or neglect or some other entry mechanism into the system).  Obtaining child welfare agency participation is likely to present substantial challenges.  Local agencies are highly variable in terms of the resources that they have available for participation in research activities, the policies and procedures that govern whether they will agree to participate, whether they will allow and facilitate access to the children and families served by the system, and as to what type of consent procedures are required for child and family participation.  The availability of staff or consultants with extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies will be necessary to facilitate this process.  Likewise, obtaining participation from an extremely high-risk and vulnerable group of children and families, will require considerable skill and resources.

This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  The minimum contractor requirements are:  (1) In-depth expertise of the issues related to the child welfare population, including issues around service delivery, service integration, child development, and family functioning, and extensive knowledge of state and local child welfare agencies; (2) expertise in sampling and survey research, as well as several of the following areas: research or evaluation study design and implementation, including experience conducting large, multi-site, longitudinal national studies; experience in working on research or evaluation projects that focus on program outcome assessment issues, as well as educational and social service programs which address these outcome issues;  3) capacity to collect data at multiple timepoints for as many as 20,000 respondents, spread over as many as 100 separate locations across the nation; experience conducting on-site research in social service settings; experience conducting on-site interviews with program staff and parents, as well as experience conducting in-depth and comprehensive assessments of children and families from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; research experience entailing social services data collection strategies; 4) experience with the analysis and integration of data with varying levels of quality from multiple sources; expertise in using state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques, including hierarchical models, growth curve analysis, structural equation modeling, attrition models, survival models; expertise in demography and the analysis of population distributions; writing reports for both a research and policy making audience; and report preparation; 5) expertise related to multi-site, longitudinal research methodology including the statistical approaches and issues related to analyzing very large (and sometimes incomplete) multi-site data sets and expertise related to outcome assessment issues associated with child welfare and related programs, as well as demographic and service delivery trends affecting this population; (6) experience managing a national data collection effort that requires participation by multiple local agencies and expertise in identifying the ethical and legal issues that may arise in the course of collecting data on high risk populations, and the skills and resources required to address such issues;  availability of an internal IRB to review the data collection plan, as well as experience in dealing with obtaining approvals from multiple external IRBs at the state and local level;  (7) experience in designing data collection strategies, including expertise in selecting data collection strategies from among the various alternatives, based on theoretical and methodological support for each specific data collection strategy (e.g., psychometric issues, previous use of techniques, and relevance for the population from low-income backgrounds and from multiple cultural and linguistic groups); (8) adequate computer/statistical resources, including ability to use CAPI and CATI data collection technologies, access to internet, and the institutional capacity to process, analyze and archive all data, including the capability to support the performance of state-of-the-art statistical modeling techniques; (9) capability to conduct large-scale  training programs to prepare field interviewers to conduct direct assessments of children from a wide range of ethnic, cultural, and linguistic populations; (10) experience in the recruitment, training, supervision and management of nationally dispersed field staff, particularly in the areas of client interviewing and child assessments;  demonstrated capacity for efficient data collection and quality control associated with multi-site longitudinal studies; ability to quickly mobilize a national cadre of skilled data collectors; experience collecting, processing and analyzing large quantities of data; experience preparing data sets for public use; and preparing written reports for Federal, State, and local agencies; and (11) expertise in collecting, analyzing, and reporting information for purposes of successful dissemination to science and practice communities, including publishing in professional journals and presenting at professional meetings;  and 12) experience with documenting and archiving data sets for secondary analysis, knowledge and expertise in the confidentiality issues surrounding data archiving, and experience with end-user technical assistance in accessing and using complex data sets.

The contractor must have an accounting system adequate to support a cost-reimbursement type contract.

This will be a full and open competition.  The solicitation will be posted at a minimum of 15 days after this posting.  The solicitation, and any amendments that may follow, will be posted on this website. No hard copies will be issued.  It is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor this website to obtain the most up-to-date information.

The use of these industry standard cost estimating databases ensures that the NPS meets facility management objectives and requirements from DOI, NPS, OMB, OIG, and other federal entities.  The NPS CESS also includes several Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications that are interoperable with the various CESS components as well as other internal and external cost datasets.  These applications include Eos Explorer Extended and Eos Advisor for which licenses are already actively utilized for cost estimating, files/folder management and comparison and analysis.  An additional CESS component is the custom application for the Timberline to Maximo export process known as TEMI.  Tasks:  The contractor will assist NPS, the Department of Interior (DOI) and other DOI bureaus, with the operation and maintenance of the CESS functionality, work flow processes, interoperable software application, databases, and provide professional services and software programs to operate, configure, update, and maintain the CESS database, related processes and business practices through the NPS and possibly DOI.  Work efforrts also include meeting/workgroup participation, database and estimating support, and general CESS related support.  The contractor will assist in the operation, maintenance, training and enhancement of, and provide additional licenses for purchase, for the COTS CESS components Eos Explorer Extended and Eos Advisor as required.  Work effort inludes providing licenses, developing, configuring, installing and supporting the COTS "bolt-on" software.  Annual renewal licensing and annual customer service plans to sustain license services are also included.  Additional support for the continued integration and enhancement of Timberline/ CESS with Maximo, FMSS, RSMeans, the NPS estimating applications, and other NPS service-wide and DOI relevant cost estimating processes and cost databases, as well as other programs may be required.   Tasks may include, but are not limited to: 1) updating and maintaining CESS Data; 2) cost estimating work group; 3) Third Party "Bolt-on" COTS software;  4) cost estimating assistance line (CEAL);  5) estimating support;  6) General CESS related support; and 7)l icenses and annual service plans.  The contract is planned for a base period with 4 option periods awarded as an IDIQ type contract with task orders being issued during the period of the contract.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. All proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   (End of Announcement)

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Moh. Iksan Tatang, Director General of Air Communications, 5th Floor, Karsa Building, Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat No.8, Jakarta 10110, Indonesia, Phone:  (62-21) 350-5133, 350-5137, Fax: (62-21) 350-5139, E-mail:  mit@pacific.net.id                      Airline Computer Reservation Systems Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop Technical Assistance to identify and recommend regulations for airline industry use of Computer Reservation Systems (CRSs) in Indonesia.  

A CRS allows a subscriber, such as a travel agent, to find flight schedules, airfares, seat availability, and to order and issue tickets.  The system also serves air carriers by providing them with an efficient way of communicating this information to the subscribers of that CRS.  In the industry, different CRSs compete to provide the best services and most complete information to their fee-based users.

Until just a few years ago, there were only two air carriers operating in Indonesia, Garuda and Merpati (both state-owned).  The passage of the "Autonomy Law 22" in 1999 opened the market to the private sector, resulting in the registration of 19 new airlines.  Although the airline industry is growing rapidly, some regulation will be needed to create a fair market environment until the industry matures.

This USTDA-funded activity will assist the Grantee to implement market-oriented reforms to minimize anticompetitive practices.  The establishment of appropriate regulations will help promote competition in Indonesia's airline industry, which first allowed private sector participation in 1999.  In the short term, this project is expected to help generate exports of CRS services, computer software and hardware.  This project will also contribute to the expansion of Indonesia's airline industry.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $117,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 P.M., JUNE 2, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to modify its contract with Abt Associates, Inc. (contract #SS00-04-60110), $1 for $2 Benefit Offset Demonstration, to include the design of a Health Benefits Plan(s) that will be implemented into the demonstration project for use by project participants.  Current contract tasks require Abt to identify appropriate support services for demonstration project participants.  Accordingly, through subsequent deliverables, Abt identified health benefits as an important support service.  SSA has determined that because Abt has extensive knowledge of the project requirements and the expertise to incorporate a health benefits plan, they are uniquely qualified to expeditiously incorporate these new design elements into the benefit offset demonstration contract.  BACKGROUND:  On September 30, 2004 SSA awarded a 2-year contract to Abt Associates for design of a multi-site, demonstration project that tests alternate methods of treating work activity in the Title II disability program.  After the design is completed, subsequent phases of this demonstration will be awarded to the same contractor on a sole source basis for the implementation, data collection and evaluation and management of the project, conditional upon successful performance of the design phase.  REQUIREMENTS:  Abt shall continue their design work for the benefit offset demonstration project to include incorporating the design of a Health Benefits Plan(s).  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Daniel Walker via email at daniel.walker@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked HBP - CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than APRIL 27, 2006, 2:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a modification will be effected against the Abt contract referenced above.  All questions must be submitted in writing to Daniel Walker via the email address listed above.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This contract is for service and maintenance support for eight DigiCORAIII Radiosounding Upper Air Systems.  V aisala Inc is the only company that can provide the service and maintenance because the hardware, software, and firmware used on the DigiCORAIII Radiosounding Systems are proprietary to Vaisala, Inc.  Acquiring the service and maintenance from the original  equipment manufacturer is more cost effective and more beneficial to the Government than to acquire similar equipment support from another vendor.

<DESC>SEE AMENDMENT 4 in FedBizOpps for all files for Solicitation No. 678-0076-06, furnish all labor, material, equipment, and supervision to complete Project No. 678-313, Research Wet Labs at the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System, 3601 S. 6th Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85730. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for eligible 8(a) firms. 8(a) firms must meet the Small Business Administrations (SBA) criterion, and have previously been certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm, which have a NAICS Code 236220 having a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years. Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents (i.e., tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists etc.) must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award. Incomplete packages will be returned without action. The Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract. Failure to obtain SBAs approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBAs request to the buying activity to terminate the award. Offers from concerns other than 8(a) will not be considered. The general description of work includes construction of a new free-standing research laboratory building. This building is approximately 6,400 gross square feet, slab-on grade, single-story construction with a reinforced concrete foundation and masonry exterior walls with a built-up low-pitch roof. A new equipment yard of approximately 1,650 square feet is to be constructed adjacent to the new building. Also included is construction of a vertical circulation addition to the south end of the existing Building 6 (nearby the new building site), as well as selective renovation and building service and utility upgrades. Building 6 contains approximately 12,500 square feet of occupiable space. The selective renovation pertains primarily to building and fire code deficiencies. The project includes a significant amount of underground utility work (most utilities are privately-owned) associated with the new building construction, the construction of the vertical circulation addition, and with new building services. Asbestos abatement (flooring, pipe insulation, crawlspace earth excavation, and exterior finish) is included in the project scope. During selective demolition, worker protection, handling and disposal of lead-based painted materials will be required. Phases of work will be staggered to provide for completion of all work roughly around the same time and to minimize the amount of time that various sections of Building 6 will need to be vacant. Part of Building 6 (existing labs on the north section of the first floor) will remain occupied during the work, requiring the utility work in this area to be accomplished during hours that can be accommodated by the tenants (primarily evenings and weekends). Contract award is subject to availability of funds. Performance period is 495 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Project Magnitude is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. Issue Date is scheduled on/about 4/12/06.  Pre-Bid Conference/Site Visit is scheduled on/about 4/25/06 at 1:00 p.m. Offer due date is 5/16/06 by 3:00 p.m. local time. Solicitation documents and amendments will be available for download on the VA Business Opportunitites Website or the Fed Biz Opps website. Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued. Any and all question regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and sent to the Contracting Officer. NOTE: Solicitation is currently being reviewed by Legal and Technical and all information identified above is subject to change.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institute of Health (NIH), strives to understand, treat and ultimately sprevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  In this context, the NIAID's mission includes the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.  These biological agents have been prioritized as Category A, B, and C.  Through this solicitation the NIAID is seeking to advance the development of therapeutics against selected NIAID Category A, B, and C bacterial pathogens via a focused, staged approach. Specifically the goal of this solicitation is to develop new, safe, and effective therapeutics for:

* Bacillus anthracis
* Yersinia pestis
* Francisella tularensis
* Burkholderia pseudomallei
* Burkholderia mallei
* Rickettsia prowazekii

Pathogens, excluding sexually-transmitted organisms (see http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/anti_stis.htm for list of excluded organisms), resistant to antimicrobial agents were recently added to the NIAID Biodefense Category C priority pathogens list. This solicitation will also support the development of candidate therapeutics with broad spectrum activity against NIAID Category C antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogen(s) and at least one of the selected Category A or B bacterial pathogens (B. anthracis, Y. pestis, F. tularensis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei and R. prowazekii). 

The candidate therapeutic should be at a stage of development that is minimally within five (5) years of completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial.  This solicitation will support non-clinical studies, medicinal chemistry, manufacturing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, and other Investigational New Drug (IND)-, New Drug Application (NDA)-, or Biologic License Application (BLA)-enabling studies.  The NIAID is particularly interested in candidate therapeutics that have broad spectrum activity and are within the regulatory purview of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Review (CDER) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is anticipated that multiple cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a period of up to five (5) years beginning on or about June 12, 2007.  BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37 will be available electronically on or about March 31, 2006 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (AO) Home Page by using the following electronic address and instructions:

NIAID/OA Home Page (via the WWW): Use http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract to access the NIAID/AO Home Page. Once at the NIAID/AO Home Page, click on the "RFPs" link and then click on "BAA NIH-NIAID-DMID-07-37, entitled, 'Development of Therapeutic Agents for Selected Biodefense Bacterial Diseases'."  

Proposals will be due on or about August 03, 2006.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal for consideration by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  See Government-wide numbered note 26.

<p>0001- 	REMOVE AND REPLACE LEL MONITOR AND CONTROLLER
Furnish all labor, tools, parts, materials, facilities, and transportation necessary to remove, replace, install, and calibrate Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) monitor and controller. This system uses remote sensors to detect the presence of JP-8 explosive vapors in the building and automatically start a purge of the facility when predetermined LEL levels are reached. This system is located in the fuel cell maintenance facility, bldg 2414.The current system is a General Monitors model 610, Four-Channel combustible gas monitor. This system monitors the LEL levels of jet fuel, JP-8, and automatically activates an alarm and a purge fan when predetermined LEL levels are attained. The current system is old and unreliable as it no longer activates the purge fan. The replacement unit must be capable of operating in a range of 0-100% LEL and must be calibrated for our particular vapor, JP-8. It must also activate an alarm and automatically energize the control circuitry of the purge fan when the predetermined LEL level is attained. Recommend replacement with a General Monitors model MC 600 Six-Channel Combustible Gas Monitor (with four cards and 4 new sensor heads) or equal, as long as there are a minimum of 4 sensors.</p>

<p>A site visit is planned on April 6 at 0900, for vendors to look at the building, in order to give more accurate quotes regarding installation. The site visit will be at the location of the old system/where the new system is to be delivered/installed, bldg 2414. For this site visit, vendors are required to have a valid driver's license, proof of registration and proof of insurance. Vendors will meet at the visitor’s center at the main gate, have temporary passes issued to them, then will be accompanied by contracting personnel to the site where work is required.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION

The National Science Foundation (NSF), Division of Science Resources Statistics (SRS) is seeking sources to help develop and present measures of patterns and trends in worldwide scientific publication. Publication data are used in the National Science Board’s Science and Engineering Indicators (SEI), and various special reports and analyses on U.S. and international science and engineering trends. This Request for Information (RFI) contains a draft statement of work that outlines four major Tasks, consisting of required activities (Task 1-3) and optional activities (Task 4) for a prospective competitive acquisition. In recent years, SEI has reported data from the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database. The NSF is seeking information on the ISI database and from organizations that maintain other databases that are either broadly comparable with the ISI database or have historical data that permit NSF to analyze time trends in scientific publications.  Further, the NSF is seeking information about available analytic services that would facilitate research using the database and about how NSF choices about the length of the contract term (five or ten years) would affect prospective bidders. 
 

Task 1.  Maintain a Suitable Publication Database.

The prospective offeror shall maintain access to a worldwide, current database that provides high quality data on science and engineering publication, including data on patterns and trends in authorship, citation, and collaboration.  The database shall provide such data for a period beginning no later than 1985.  The database utilized shall be suitable for trend analysis and shall enable an analyst with access to the database to determine whether and to what extent similarities and differences over time result from characteristics of the database being analyzed (e.g., journal coverage) rather than from characteristics of the research community’s publication patterns. 

The database shall enable NSF and contractors selected to perform tasks to do the following:
·	attribute authorship and citation credit for published articles to different U.S. institutions, institutional sectors, and states.   
·	attribute authorship and citation credit to different countries and country groupings.  
·	attribute authorship and citation credit to U.S. institutions, U.S. institutional sectors, U.S. states, and other countries and country groupings without extensive recoding of the data.  
·	attribute publication and citation credit for multi-author articles either by assigning proportional credit to each institutional author or by assigning full credit to each institutional author.
·	attribute articles to both sub-fields and broad fields of science and engineering, including social sciences and psychology.
·	Produce all tables and spreadsheets described in Task 2.

In addition to the required data, it would be desirable for the database to:

·	Credit publications to the individuals who author them (and not only to the institutions with which those individuals are affiliated).   
·	Attribute authorship and citation credit to foreign institutions without extensive recoding of the data.
·	Include non-traditional measures of scientific output and knowledge flows.  Possible measures include, but are not limited to, electronic publications beyond those that appear in conventional journals, publications on pre-print servers, measures of support and knowledge flows drawn from acknowledgements, and measures of participation in conferences.
·	Include field classification(s) that are broadly compatible with both NSF’s WebCaspar field classification (http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/database.cfm) and the field classification in SEI 2004.


Task 2.  Provide Analytic and Technical Support.

Subtask 2a.  Support for SEI (Mandatory).

Once selected, the Contractor shall prepare electronic files of approximately 40 summary tables similar to those in SEI 2004 suitable for inclusion in the 2008, 2010, and 2012 editions of SEI (appendix tables 5-34-5-54; these are available at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind04/pdf_v2.htm#c5).  The selected Contractor will also provide extensive detailed data in the form of Excel and SAS files to support these tables.

Timeline for SEI data delivery: 
 
a)	SEI 2008: The selected Contractor shall produce time-series data from 1985 to 2005 or beyond and shall deliver these data to the COTR on or before March 31, 2007;
b)	SEI 2010: The selected Contractor shall produce time-series data from 1985 to 2007 or beyond and shall deliver these data to the COTR on or before March 31, 2009; and,
c)	SEI 2012: The selected  Contractor shall produce time-series data from 1985 to 2009 and shall deliver these data to the COTR on or before March 31, 2011.

The selected Contractor shall be prepared to report data on the following indicators:

a)	Publication counts: 

1.	Scientific and engineering publications for all countries, and selected regions and groups of countries (e.g., European Union, OECD, East Asia), as directed by the COTR.  

2.	U.S. publications by U.S. sector (academic, government, industry, non-profit, etc.).

3.	Highly cited articles and journals by various percentiles (i.e. top 1%, top 5%, top 10%, etc.) for all countries, selected regions and groups of countries, and U.S. sector (academic, government, industry, non-profit, etc.). 

4.	All U.S. institutions by sector.

5.	Breakdowns by field and subfield.

b)	Citation indicators:

1.	Total citation counts and counts excluding self-citations (i.e., same country, same region, same group of countries, etc.) of scientific literature of nations and selected regions.

2.	Matrix of cross-national, cross-regional, and within-region citations by country and selected regions.

3.	U.S. sector total and matrix of cross sector citations.

4.	U.S. institutions by sector, field, and sub-field.

5.	Citations by nation, selected regions, U.S. sector, and U.S. institution normalized for number and/or share of publications, i.e. impact factors.

6.	Breakdowns by field and subfield.

c)     Indicators of collaboration:

1.	 National, cross-national, cross-regional, and within-region co-authorship.

2.	U.S. within- and cross-sector co authorship.

Subtask 2b.  Other technical support. The selected Contractor shall provide technical data analysis support for SRS and NSF analyses and publications other than SEI.  

Task 3.  Data Access, Maintenance & Archiving.

The NSF seeks to match publications data from the prospective offeror’s database with records from other databases so that NSF can conduct studies of selected topics concerning scientific productivity and knowledge flows (e.g., the relationship between individual productivity and career outcomes, knowledge spillovers across institutional and geographic boundaries).  The full results of these studies shall be fully available to NSF for public dissemination.

It is desirable that the selected Contractor would maintain output files for each of the indicators provided under the contract, in SAS or another major off-the-shelf code. These output files shall contain all information necessary to produce the indicators. In addition, the selected Contractor would produce and maintain a Master file of all these output data files, and a set of data extraction programs with which data from any combination of file elements can be extracted upon request. 

Following completion of the contract, the Master file would be delivered to the COTR and these files would become the property of the NSF. In addition, the Contractor shall guarantee access for eight years from the close of the contract to a confidential archive that includes the base data and materials (e.g., data requests, working tables, analytical algorithms, etc.) used to generate the tabulations that were released in SEI and other reports. This archive shall be used by NSF or its contractors to verify and correct data in the Master file.

It would be desirable, upon completion of the contract, for the Contractor to expand access to this confidential archive for eight years from the close of the contract so that NSF or its contractors could conduct further analyses of the data or bona fide researchers could pursue original research. 

Task 4.  Indicators Development. (Optional)

Subtask 4a.  Inter & Multi-disciplinarity Indicators.  The selected Contractor would develop and test indicators of interdisciplinarity (integration of separate disciplines to address a research problem), and/or multidisciplinarity (coordinated research in two or more disciplines to address a research problem).  

Subtask 4b.  Network Analysis. The selected Contractor would develop and test indicators of network structure (e.g., size, density, amounts and directions of influences, etc.) affecting scientific publication.  

Subtask 4c.  Classifying Journal/Article Types.  SRS currently classifies journals on a scale from most basic to fully applied.  The selected Contractor would prepare a report reviewing the utility of this classification.  The selected Contractor would develop up to three feasible classifications of journal and/or article types that could be incorporated into the journal database.

Subtask 4d.  Authorship indicators. The selected Contractor would conduct a methodological study of biases that may be introduced in bibliometric studies by crediting institutional rather than individual authorship.  

Subtask 4e.  Visualization.  The Contractor or directed sub-contractor shall develop and test visualization tools that will help non-expert readers grasp major patterns and trends in bibliometric data.  

Subtask 4f.  Linkages between science and technology.  Using data available in the database or augmenting the database with added elements, the selected Contractor would develop and test indicators of knowledge flows between science and technology.  

QUALIFIED OFFERORS RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS
It is requested that interested qualified firms submit a statement of their capabilities to perform the work described in this notice.  This statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Efforts should be made to keep responses as BRIEF as possible, concentrating on substantive information essential for a proper review/consideration.  The Government will not pay for the cost of response submission. 

 ELIGIBILITY QUALIFIERS 

Prospective offerors must either (1) be able to license with ISI for suitable access to their database and be capable of providing needed services or (2) have or be able to license for suitable access to a database that is broadly comparable in scope and content with the ISI database and contains historical data suitable for analyzing trends over time.  Prospective offerors must be able to retain suitable access to the data for eight years beyond the life of the contract.


SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR QUALIFIED RESPONDENTS

<DESC>This Request for Information is issued by the Satellite Control and Network Systems Group, SMC/SN, to solicit information from industry that will aid the SPO in assessing the state of the art in training/simulation systems that could be standardized to train satellite command and control operators.  Information obtained as a result of this posting may be used for the development of a future standardized training system at SMC for satellite command and control.  Currently, a prospective satellite operator is trained on a system that is unique to the satellite they will ultimately be flying.  This is costly in that numerous “stovepipe” training systems for the various missions must be developed and maintained.  To reduce cost, a new vision for training that is modeled after Air Force flight training is being investigated for implementation.  The new vision calls for a Standardized Space Trainer (SST) to be used at both IQT and Unit Training for AFSPC satellite operators.  Standardized hardware, system software and networking capabilities (crew & positional training and HLA compliance for distributed training) are the core concept of SST.  Software applications will be developed to execute system specific space ops unit training: GPS OCX, SBIRS, TSAT, etc applications would operate on Standardized Space Trainer just like opening Word, Excel, Photoshop, Quake, etc, on a desktop PC.  Additionally, development of software for Space IQT to train students to “fly” a simulated generic military satellite with basic on-board functions is desired. This training will provide students with an overview of military satellite systems and their ground systems; fundamentals of space flight, orbital mechanics, etc.; knowledge of on-board sub-systems common to all satellites (non-payload specific); and fundamentals for establishing satellite contacts and conducting telemetry, tracking & control operations on a generic satellite system.  After graduating from “basic training,” operators would be sent to specialized training where they will learn about specific mission satellites and how to perform command and control operations on them using the same training system.  The desired standardized training system would support both types of training and have the capability to be customized to provide a similar “look and feel” to the system that the students would ultimately be using.  This would imply a similar set of data displays, commanding functions, and a “training fidelity” satellite simulator modeled after the target system.  The standardized training system should be COTS based and provide an environment that is easily customizable.  In effect, the training system could consist of a PC with sufficient memory and speed, displays and a number of software applications running on an operating system that supports the basic and specialized training courses as well as different crew sizes and positions. 
The following information is requested: 
1)	Describe currently existing products that could be made to function as a standardized trainer for satellite command and control.  Indicate if your company would be prepared to demonstrate such products to the government for evaluation.
2)	Describe standard languages/tools that could be used by a developer to produce training-level satellite simulations that run under a standardized training environment.
3)	Describe industry standards that exist for human/machine interface regarding the display of satellite telemetry data and satellite commanding.
4)	If standards of items 2 and 3 do not exist, provide specific suggestions on how the Government might best develop such standards.
5)	Describe the ability of a standardized training system to accommodate positional, crew, and distributed training.
6)	Describe the ability of the user to modify training material, scenario scripts and system responses and basic error and/or fault injection for training scenarios to include automated trainee performance monitoring for evaluating training.
7)	We also invite industry to comment on specialized features that have the potential to enhance a standardized trainer through the use of:  3-D visualization to present a graphical view of the actions taken that effect the satellite operations; and intelligent tutoring agents, an overview of the environment (space and terrestrial) and the potential affects the environment can have on satellite operations to include C2 of the satellite, and basic operations. 

Questions/concerns regarding this request for information shall be sent, in writing, via e-mail to the Contracting Officer.  This request for information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Inquiry (RFI), request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this request for information and the Government's use of such information. Respondents of this request for information may be requested to provide additional information/details/demonstrations based on their initial submittals.  Responses to this request for information are to be submitted and addressed to the Contracting Officer, at the above referenced email address, no later than 23 May 2006.  Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.

<DESC>Parachute and Delivery Technologies for Deep Digger Weapons System The U.S Army ARDEC, AETC, Picatinny Arsenal is seeking information on the  capability of designing and developing cost effective, secure way of carrying  and air dropping  a precision weapon.  ARDEC is doing exploratory concept work  on the Deep Digger Weapon system, a self contained, projectile based drilling  device for delivering warhead to deeply buried targets. The DD system uses a  series of drill and blast events to drill through rock and other hardened  targets. The system will be dropped out of a fast moving airplane, cargo  airplane, or helicopter. At the drop zone the DD weapon system should be able  to land and autonomously prepare for deployment.  Potential landing strategies  include deploying a tripod for soft landing, using an explosive charge to clear  overburden, and developing a penetrator to begin digging before the system  lands.  Accuracy and low velocity air drop are highly critical to the mission.  It is also necessary to leverage currently available air delivery methods to  overcome issues in air cargo missions such as wind induced drift, severe  weather conditions operations, heavy cargo weight, collision avoidance, plane  speed, and system breakage.   ARDEC is seeking information on these topics now  in the early concept development phase in preparation for a potential follow on  contract to develop the delivery and landing system. Pursuant to FAR 15.201(c)(3), the US Army TACOM-ARDEC invites all interested  parties to review and provide comment to this Draft Request for Proposals  (DRFP) for the purpose of indentifying and resolving concerns regarding  acquistion strategy, etc. The Government seeks comments from potential  industry sources.

<DESC>This special announcement has two purposes: (1) to obtain expressions of interest from the small business community in the Integrated Test and Analysis Contract (ITAC) competition at the prime contractor level, and (2) to roughly gauge the capability  of those interested small business firms or teams as viable contenders at the prime contractor level. The capability papers and associated evaluations discussed in this notice do NOT replace the in-depth evaluation of a firm or teams ability to perform; that evaluation will be part of the formal source selection process. The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT), in partnership with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is seeking possible sources experienced in plann ing, organizing, and operating comprehensive, widely distributed experimental combinations of weapons systems and/or other equipment of interest.  Combinations may include (but not be limited to) items such as weapons system Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) lab oratories, Software-in-the-loop (SWIL), detailed (up to and including detailed engineering level) modeling and simulation (M&S) products, databases reflecting detailed weapon system operations, threat system representations and /or any other asset required , for integrated test and analysis experiments. Several U. S. Government-supported efforts are expected to be integrated in the performance of this contract through the use of directed subcontractors to the ITAC prime contractor.  The Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) developed by Teledyne Brown, the Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense Embedded Test (ET) capability developed by Boeing, the U.S. Government-supported contractor radar laboratories operated by Raytheon, and the Ground Based Missile Defense System Integrated System Test Capability (I STC)  resources (built and operated by Boeing at the Advanced Research Center) are expected to be heavily leveraged with the ITAC tasks.  The bulk of tasks are expected to be managed and/or performed at the laboratories within Redstone Arsenal Building 540 0. The anticipated competition will result in an indefinite-delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a period of performance of five years with one five-year option. It is anticipated that the requirements will be executed via task orders issued, based on actual customer requirements.  ITAC integration tasks shall revolve around (but not be limited to) the following core functions: program and task management; derive specific ITAC requirements from customer event definitions; purchase task-enabling hardware , software, network, or any other material items; integrate geographically distributed customer-specified assets into acceptable test and analysis event configurations; provide operational networks of HWIL, SWIL, communication linkages, etc.; perform funct ional and qualification testing; perform and/or assist customer agents with event operations; arrange for data collection, storage, processing, and delivery; assist independent verification, validation, accreditation, and qualification agents; and assist i ndependent configuration management agents. Software developed incidental to the performance of the contract shall be delivered to the Government as both source and executable code and shall be considered a Special Work pursuant to DFARs 252.227-7020, Rights in Special Works. Due to uneven customer support requirements, the contractor should have the ability to provide qualified personnel to meet surge requirements.  Firms that can meet requirements set forth above are requested to provide a statement (not to exceed 8 pages) of  capabilities and information demonstrating management and technical experience on similar acquisitions. Information shall be provided to the Contract Specialist via e-mail to john.penley@smdc.army.mil  no later than 20 days from issuance of this Notice. F ir ms responding should also state their company size and small business status, as well as their interest (i.e., as prime or subcontractor).  NAICS Code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.  This synopsis is for information and p lanning purposes only, does not constitute an IFB or RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. No solicitatio n exists at this time; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and available at the SMDC Website (http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/ITAC.html).  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any synopsis or solicitation. The resultant contract will contain an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) clause that could limit a successful proposer from participating in any other SMDC or MDA contracts. To the greatest extent possible, while still protecting the Governments i nterests, the OCI clause will be applied only for the supported technology areas of the contractors actual technical analysis performance. The capability paper shall indicate the contractors Facility Clearance level. This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.

<SUBJECT>A -- Control of Protein Conformation (CPC) Proposer's Day Workshop
<DESC>Special Notice SN06-23: Control of Protein Conformation (CPC) Proposer's Day Workshop, DATE: May 22, 2006, REGISTRATION DEADLINE: May 15, 2006, TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Donald J. Leo, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4939 

In anticipation of a potential program on the topic of Control of Protein Conformations, DARPA is hosting a Proposer’s Day workshop that will provide critical information on the program vision, the program milestones, and opportunities associated with the development of an interdisciplinary team to respond to BAA 06-19, Addendum 2.  The workshop will be held on May 22, 2006, in Arlington, Virginia.  

The goals and milestones of the DARPA Control of Protein Conformations program are specified in the Broad Agency Announcement, BAA-06-19, Addendum 2.  A highly interdisciplinary team will be required to perform the effort and meet the Phase I milestones.  The Proposer’s Day will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to the CPC Broad Agency Announcement.

 This meeting has three goals: 1) To familiarize potential proposers with DARPA’s vision and motivation for the CPC Program, 2) To explain the mechanics of a DARPA Program, and the goals, milestones, and metrics of this effort, and 3) To promote discussion of synergistic capabilities and teaming among potential program participants.  

The Proposer’s Day workshop will be divided into three sessions.  Session I will consist of a detailed overview presentation of the vision and motivation for the CPC Program and may include additional presentations relevant to the development of chemical and biological countermeasures; Session II will consist of a question and answer session between the participants and the DARPA POC; Session III will consist of a poster session that will facilitate the formation of teams with the necessary expertise to respond to BAA 06-19, Addendum 2, Control of Protein Conformation (CPC).  

Potential participants should note that formation of teams that have expertise in the three technical areas described above will be critical to the success of the program.  DARPA will not be funding component technologies that address only a subset of the technologies listed above through BAA 06-19, Addendum 2, Control of Protein Conformation (CPC).

Appropriate teaming will be a critical element in responding to  the DARPA Control of Protein Conformations solicitation. CPC Proposer's Day workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing areas of capabilities in order to facilitate communications, interactions, and teaming discussions during the poster session. Workshop details including registration, poster session, meeting location, and lodging are given on the CPC registration website at http://www.eventmakeronline.com/sta/view/index.asp?meetingid=76.

There is no fee for the CPC Proposer's Day workshop. Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 75 attendees) and early registration is strongly recommended. The registration cutoff date is May 15, 2006, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first. Further administrative information is available from Dan Wright (dan.wright.ctr@darpa.mil). Additional technical information can be obtained from Donald Leo (donald.leo@darpa.mil). Please refer to the “CPC Proposer's Day” workshop in your correspondence. This announcement is not a request for proposals.

GENERAL INFORMATION:  The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to th is statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:    1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. 2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your respon se - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected 3  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party  through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in t he possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,   4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the begin ning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS. 5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. 6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

Background:   NDW Districts conducted Pre-solicitation meetings for its Army Transformation Program on the dates, times and location indicated below.  17 October 2005:  Fort Riley, Kansas at the Ft Riley Conference Center Ballroom, 446 Seitz Drive, Ft. Riley, KS.  19 October 2005:  Fort Carson, Colorado at the Doubletree Hotel Colorado Springs-World Arena, 1775 E. Cheyenne Mountain Blvd., Colorado Springs, Colorado 21 October 2005:  Fort Lewis, Washington at the Ft Lewis Battle Simulation Center Auditorium, Bldg 1240 Operations (Multipurpose Room) Fort Lewis, WA.    The objectives of the pre-solicitation meetings were to  (1) share the programming documents (DD1391s) with industry for FY 06 requirements, (2) discuss military construction requirements for FY 07- FY11 programs, (3) discuss various contract arrangements  and how they may be implemented for this work, (4) share information on the solicitation, criteria, evaluation and award process. Specifically, to discuss evaluation criteria that may be used to identify those firms that offer the best value and will resu lt in a contract award, and how to prepare proposals to be competitive for these requirements,  (5) Leverage Small Business participation as prime contractors and as subcontractors.  (6) To identify and discuss barriers to small business participation (7) To discuss the requirement for Small Business Subcontracting Plans, educate industry on how to prepare and implement the plans, including available resources and (8) to foster networking opportunities to facilitate teaming for this work. The NWD Army Construction Program within NWD is expected to more than double over the next five years.  Large scope, multi-facility projects on fast-track timelines will become the norm for the foreseeable future.  Primary drivers include DOD initiatives o f Global Posture Initiative (GPI), Re-stationing, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005, and the Armys initiative for Transformation into Units of Action (UA). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted national market research by holding nationwide Industry Forums to seek industry capability and input into how to execute a multi-billion dollar military construction (MILCON) program across the United States.  In order to achieve the quality, flexibility, adaptability, sustainability, as well as time and cost savings that the Army is wanting to achieve, industry told USACE that it will have to consider the MILCON Program to open up its Program to many d ifferent types of construction methods that are available and utilized throughout the United States by private industry.   Industry shared four major recommendations: 1. Utilize industry best practices, standards and codes.2. Utilize performance based (outcome oriented) type contracts versus its current prescriptive specifications that specify exactly what materials will be used, how the facility is to be constructed, a nd when each phase of the construction will be completed . 3. Construction methods such as pre-fabricated, pre-engineered, panelized or tilt-up walls and permanent modular construction methods are solutions that the Government should seriously consider in order to meet the needs of the Army.  4. The government could achieve cost savings through bulk buys of materials if awarded more than one of the same type of facility. Additionally the gathered information will facilitate the development of teaming arrangements, for more information on teaming arrangements please check the SBA website at http://sba.gov or contact any Small Business Representative listed below:   Telephone calls regarding Small Business matters (Kansas City District) should be made to: Arthur Saulsberry 816-983-3927.

Statement of Work

TITLE:  Establishing the Governance Model for the DHAP Division within the National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention
					
I.  BACKGROUND 

This project is a follow-on to a previous project that involved analyzing and providing recommendations relating to the appropriateness of the organizational structure of DHAP.  Previous recommendations include:  (1) maintaining one division and making changes to the organizational structure and division functions, maximizing strengths and adjusting the functions of leaders, e.g.,  increasing the number of deputy positions and changing titles, and reporting relationships to increase branch interaction and responsiveness to partner constituency;  (2) expanding Director authority and responsibility, e.g. 90% of day-to-day decisions made as Director/Branch Chief level rather than Division Director; and  (3) increasing the role of the Division Associate Directors.  This function will allow for leading crosscutting issues within the division and serve as liaisons for increased inter-branch communication and cooperation.  Based on subject matter expertise, ongoing teams can be developed to increase communication, involve partners in relevant issues, increase dialogue to avoid duplication of efforts or voids in activities, identify emerging issues to increase proactivity and decrease reactivity in response and anticipation.  The ultimate goal is to improve branch support, enhance communication, and increase responsiveness to partners, deadlines, crises, and emerging issues.  

This project will guide the implementation of the new DHAP alignment.  As new responsibilities are created for the entire Division leadership group and specific authority is delegated to Deputy Division Directors and Associate Directors, a structured program of implementation will be necessary to further enhance the leadership capacity of the Division personnel.  Phase I of the project will establish the governance model and organizational structure for DHAP.  Phase II of the project will guide the implementation of the new DHAP alignment.  As new responsibilities are created for the entire Division leadership group and specific authority is delegated to Deputy Division Directors and Associate Directors, a structured program of implementation will be necessary to further enhance the leadership capacity of the Division personnel.  


II.  PURPOSE

Phase I- To establish the governance model and organizational structure for DHAP

Phase II- To create leadership capacity, monitor the rate of successful implementation, and ensure efficient governance

III . SCOPE OF WORK

Phase I- This project shall include reviewing and updating previous recommendations.

1.	The contractor shall conduct meetings with the Division Director and existing Deputy Directors to assess the current situation within the Division and determine the strategies necessary for implementing the previous recommendations.  The contractor shall request additional suggestions and ideas regarding the creation of a workable and efficient structure that would officially combine the two existing Divisions formally into one.

2.	The contractor shall conduct discussions and perform analyses to identify and define new and existing reporting relationships and clarify the specific roles of Deputy Division Directors and Associate Directors.

3.	The contractor shall formulate specific agreements regarding those responsibilities and authority to be delegated throughout the leadership structure (from the Director to Deputy Directors, Associate Directors and Branch Chiefs). 





Phase II- This project shall include reviewing and updating previous recommendations from Phase I.  

1.  	The contractor shall structure communication mechanisms that will insure an effective flow of information from the staff upwards to Divisional leadership.

2.  	The contractor shall implement methods for monitoring the successful delegation of authority to the Deputy Directors and Branch Chiefs.  This includes an assessment of how effective the new Division structure is functioning once it is in place and identifies any necessary ongoing corrections.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.   If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.   If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.   The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.   Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.   This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).   Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a carrier structure (CS) with a one-piece skin for a Manufacturing Demonstration Unit (MDU)(4 each) as further described within the attached information on the MDU CS. This requirement can be satisfied with minor modifications to large pressure vessels, spacecraft propellant or fuel storage tank dome heads.	The MDU CS serves as a structural back plane to hold the TPS materials in place and retain the outer mold line shape under various loads due to inertial, atmospheric environments, space environments, and vibro-acoustic launch enviroments.  The CEV is a critical component in the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE), and will serve as the primary manned space vehicle to the International Space Station as well as to the moon and eventually to Mars. The primary purpose of the final flight heat shield is to protect the CEV during atmospheric entry after low earth orbit (LEO) or lunar direct return (LDR) missions. The carrier structure serves as a structural back plane to hold the TPS materials in place and retain the outer mold line shape under various loads due to inertial, atmospheric environments, space environments, and vibro-acoustic launch environments.  Under the current TPS Advanced Development Project (ADP), there is a need to demonstrate the manufacturability of full scale heat shields.  The MDU carrier structures produced under this  solicitation will be provided by the Government to the TPS Phase II contractors.  The TPS Phase II contractors will apply their TPS material systems to these carrier structures to complete their MDUs.   This requirement also includes a shipping container for each of the four CS.  In addition, there are 3 optional requirements.  Option 1 is for shipping costs for the four MDU CS, which will be established as a not-to-exceed (NTE) value.  (For pricing purposes, quoters will be asked to price the shipment to four different locations, and the most expensive of the four will become the NTE.)  Option 2 is for up to two additional MDU CS and up to two additional shipping containers.  Option 3 is for shipping costs for up to two additional MDU CS and will be established as a NTE value.  (For pricing purposes, quoters will be asked to price the shipment to four different locations, and the most expensive of the four will become the NTE).

<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD, 5 APRIL 2006, RE:  PreQuote meeting for RFQ# AG-0120-S-06-0018, Meeting started at 10:30am.
The following people were at the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center: 
Lezlie Murray, BBVC Director, Forest Service, 1lmurray01@fs.fed.us
Joe Williams, Law Enforcement, Forest Service, fwilliams@fs.fed.us
WillieRademaker, Nakuuruq Solutions, wrademaker@nakuuruq.com
Bill Fair, ATS Alaska, bfair@atsalaska.com.  The following people called in on the bridge line:  Denise Murphy, Purchasing Agent, Forest Service, denisemurphy@fs.fed.us, 907-743-9531, Kervin Spivey, Jen-esis, www.jenesisUSA.com, kspivey@jen-esis.com, 240-674-4625, Colin Charette, QRSciences, ccharette@qrsciences.com, The high resolution camera can be seen at www.SentryScope.com, 858-613-8755.  Meeting called to discuss the scope of project, locations to be monitored and what the Forest Service (FS) wants to do.   Denise Murphy, Purchasing Agent, gave a quick overview of what the project is about. Question asked about maintenance to the equipment.  The quote package does not address this issue.  Quoters are requested to provide information on warranty offered on the equipment and any optional maintenance agreements that may be purchased.  Vendors who were able to meet at the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center (BBVC) will be escorted to the roof of the building to get a good look at the area.  Lezlie Murray will get pictures to Denise Murphy so she can create a slide show for vendors who called in.  Lezlie will also bring maps by that give a top view of the location and show proximity of all locations.  Lezlie will note dimensions of the parking lots.  Mr. Charette asked what the Forest Service wants.  For example, do we want high resolution cameras?  Do we want to be able to read license plate numbers?  The purpose of the system is to apprehend “smash and grab” vandals – people who smash out windows in parked cars and take valuables.  The ideal location for cameras is high vantage point because there are a lot of campers that park in the lot by the BBVC.  The campers create an obstacle.  The higher the camera the better it can “see” what is going on around the campers.  The power to the BBVC is commercial power with a back up that takes over in the event of failure.  The remote locations do not have a power source.  The cameras at these locations will have to operate off battery power.  Remote locations are between 1 mile, half mile and quarter mile from the BBVC respectively.  
The Forest Service is asking vendors to submit information regarding back up capability of their respective system.  Ideally we would like to save 30 days of recording for each location.  The Forest Service will not have the system manned each day.  The FS intends to check it every so often to back up the tape.  The images would be stored on a hard drive.  The Forest Service will need a total of five (5) cameras. How does the Forest Service want to view the remote cameras?  The Forest Service is not requiring any special way to view the remote camera locations.  Quoter’s shall provide information on options available.  Does the Forest Service have wireless capability at the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center?  No.  The system will need a remote viewer with software. There is a camera mounted on top of the BBVC that belongs to the FAA.  The FAA will allow security cameras to be mounted on that pole, however, authorization will be required.  The FAA is concerned that if cameras are mounted on different poles, they will interfere with the line of site for their camera.  It is not a wireless camera, it is hardwired.  Lezlie will find out what frequency this camera uses and information will be passed on to quoters.  There are no poles at the remote locations.  The Forest Service would like to have the cameras mounted in a tree if possible.  The idea is that people will not know they are there and will be less likely to vandalize them.  Quoters shall suggest best mounting location.  The remote locations do not have a power source.  Cameras will have to operate off of batter power.  Quotes shall state best mounting method.  Vandalism is rare, however, it does happen.  Lezlie will take photographs and send to Denise to distribute.  Meeting closed at 11:00am.  Notes added on 10 April 2006.  Frequencies for existing antennas on top of the visitor center:
•	NOAA, National Weather Service antennas – one is 135.45 mhz and the other is 410.075 mhz
•	FS Antenna for Dispatch Radios – 150 – 160 mhz
•	Portage Glacier Cruises antenna for their phone system – unable to get exact information at this time (estimated to be 800 – 900 mhz).

Additional information gathered by Lezlie Murray and Joe Willliams:  Gravel Pit Road:  The gravel pit is exactly one (1) mile from the visitor center (originally thought to be about ½ mile).  That location may be difficult because they are so many very large trees that block the view of the visitor center.  The camera will have to be mounted approximately 25 – 30 feet from the ground to be able to send its signal to the receiver on top of the visitor center.  This location has no power.  The camera shall have its own power source.  The camera location closer in on that road is very near the bunkhouse and will also have to be mounted at least 10-15 feet above the ground to have line of site over the trees to the visitor center.  That location is right next to Chugach Electric’s power supply that serves the bunkhouse, so it may be possible to hook up to power at that location. Maps/pictures that are available:
•	Digital photographs of locations – file is very large.  Pictures may be accessed by going to ftp://ftp2.fs.fed.us/incoming/chugtong_r10, look for file titled "AG0120S060018_GRDSecuritySys" double click the file to open it.  
•	Portage Valley brochure map with camera sites marked, only hard copy available.  Please call for a copy.  
•	Byron Glacier Trail map, electronic copy available.  Please email for a copy.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for the following commercial items:

<p>0001- 	REMOVE AND REPLACE LEL MONITOR AND CONTROLLER
Furnish all labor, tools, parts, materials, facilities, and transportation necessary to remove, replace, install, and calibrate Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) monitor and controller. This system uses remote sensors to detect the presence of JP-8 explosive vapors in the building and automatically start a purge of the facility when predetermined LEL levels are reached. This system is located in the fuel cell maintenance facility, bldg 2414.The current system is a General Monitors model 610, Four-Channel combustible gas monitor. This system monitors the LEL levels of jet fuel, JP-8, and automatically activates an alarm and a purge fan when predetermined LEL levels are attained. The current system is old and unreliable as it no longer activates the purge fan. The replacement unit must be capable of operating in a range of 0-100% LEL and must be calibrated for our particular vapor, JP-8. It must also activate an alarm and automatically energize the control circuitry of the purge fan when the predetermined LEL level is attained. Recommend replacement with a General Monitors model MC 600 Six-Channel Combustible Gas Monitor (with four cards and 4 new sensor heads) or equal, as long as there are a minimum of 4 sensors.</p>

<p>A site visit is planned on April 6 at 0900, for vendors to look at the building, in order to give more accurate quotes regarding installation. The site visit will be at the location of the old system/where the new system is to be delivered/installed, bldg 2414. For this site visit, vendors are required to have a valid driver's license, proof of registration and proof of insurance. Vendors will meet at the visitor’s center at the main gate, have temporary passes issued to them, then will be accompanied by contracting personnel to the site where work is required.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is to clarify the request for unpriced proposals, RFP No. W15QKN-06-R-0738.  Contracts will not be awarded as a result of this  solicitation.  The Government is planning to establish Blanket Purchase  Agreements in order to prepare for future landscaping requirements arise.   There is no â€œbid formâ€ for this procurement because there is no current  requirement for Landscaping Services at Picatinny Arsenal.  Unpriced proposals  are requested with pertinent information sufficient to assess the capabilities  of interested vendors, in order to establish multiple Blanket Purchase  Agreements to ensure maximum practicable competition.  As stated in the  announcement, future landscaping requirements will be competed among the BPA  holders.  Requests for Quotations will be used for those procurements.  This  method will streamline the procurement process as actual landscaping  requirements arise. To be considered for a BPA, you must submit pertinent information with your  unpriced proposal.  Information submitted should be specific in the technical  area under consideration, i.e., Landscaping Services, on each of the following  qualifications: (1)Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work  previously performed or being performed; (2) Personnel: Name, professional  qualifications and specific experience of technical personnel; (3) Facilities:  Availability and description of special materials/equipment required to perform  in the technical areas under consideration.  Any other specific and pertinent  information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would  enhance the Government's consideration and evaluation of the information  submitted.  Compliance with the ARDEC 68 Clause and submission of  Representations and Certifications of Offeror are required.
