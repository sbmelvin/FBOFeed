The HEU TIP provides assurance that weapons useable HEU material from dismantled weapons is eliminated from the Russian stockpile by monitoring its down blending into Low Enriched Uranium (LEU).  The HEU TIP achieves these results by sending teams of experts to four Russian uranium-processing facilities, in closed cities, to monitor processing operations. The program also maintains and staffs a Transparency Monitoring Office (TMO) in Novouralsk, Russia for ongoing monitoring operations at the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Plant. This announcement will serve as notice that the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Nuclear Risk Reduction NA-23, is seeking small business prime contractor sources.

The Launch Capability contracts will support current program requirements as a result of EELV Buy 1 and Buy 2.  In addition, the Launch Capability contracts will support launches from the proposed EELV Buy 3 manifest.  The new Launch Capability contracts, when negotiated, will be cost type, award fee, FAR Part 15 Contracts.  The Launch Capability contracts shall provide, but are not limited to, the following: Launch and Range Operations for both Vandenberg AFB and Cape Canaveral AFS, Mission Integration, Mission Unique Development and Integration, Systems Engineering and Program Management, Subcontract Support, Factory Support Engineering, and Special Studies.  The Request for Proposal will be issued in April 2005 and the Government intends to award the contracts on or before 1 October 2005. The Government may also elect not to award the Launch Capability contracts or any launch services as a result of this solicitation. The Government intends to allocate the potential Department of Defense (DoD) and National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) missions between Boeing Launch Services and Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc.  The Launch Services contracts shall provide, but are not limited to, the following: Core Vehicle/Upper Stage, Payload Fairing/Payload Adaptor, Mission Unique Hardware, Mission Assurance Instrumentation, and Booster Storage Costs (if required). The EELV program is an expendable space launch system that will satisfy the Government portion of the National Launch Forecast (excluding crew-rated or cargo return missions), reduce overall system recurring costs, and maintain or improve upon the reliability, operability, and capability of current medium through heavy lift systems (heritage launch systems). The EELV system includes, but is not limited to, launch vehicles, facilities, support equipment, and payload integration in support of the launch of satellites for the DoD and NRO.  As a result of a competitive acquisition held in 1998, the EELV Initial Launch Service (ILS) contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc. and Delta Launch Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, on 16 Oct 98.

<DESC>The Tobacco Control Research Branch (TCRB), located in the Behavioral Research Program (BRP) of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking a contractor to conduct multidisciplinary research on the interplay of tobacco product type, behavior of product use, chemistry, toxicology, and biology in order to determine the addiction and cancer risk potential of new, potential, reduced-exposure tobacco products.  Little is known about the composition of these products, how they are actually used (i.e., alone or in conjunction with conventional cigarettes),  their true impact on users’ exposure to harmful tobacco and smoke constituents and there is an urgent need for scientific guidance regarding laboratory methods and biomarkers for evaluating toxicity and exposures for individual users of these products. The contractor will conduct studies aimed at the evaluation of exposures to toxic and carcinogenic agents among users of different types of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, and how they are modified by product type, gender, and ethnicity/race. Major emphasis will be on development and validation of sensitive, specific, and high throughput laboratory methods and their application in large population studies.  The major task areas will involve 1) assessment of tobacco product emissions under varying behavior conditions; 2) standardization and validation of laboratory methods and exposure biomarkers; 3) information gathering on toxicity biomarkers; 4) communication of major findings and 5) interaction with Expert Consulting Committee. It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion-type contract will be awarded and that the period of performance will consist of a  period of five (5) years. This applicable NAICS Code is 541710 .  This solicitation will be available electronically on or about April 8, 2005.  The RFP may be accessed through Internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THIS INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THIS SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS, IF ANY.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  ALL INQUIRIES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO CONTRACTING OFFICER THERESA H. SHROFF at ts144t@nih.gov.  Point of contact:   Theresa H. Shroff, Contracting Officer, at e-mail address: ts144t@nih.gov; telephone: 301-435-3796 and fax: 301-402-8579.

<DESC>NASA/Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for Satellite Tool Kit (STK) Software.  KSC, Launch Services Program, intends to use this Satellite Tool Kit to perform spacecraft and launch vehicle radio frequency (RF) link analyses and visualize the performance of launch vehicle communication systems during flight.	 NASA/KSC intends to purchase the item(s) from Analytical Graphics Inc. (AGI), (Attn: John O’Brien), 220 Valley Creek Blvd., Exton, PA  19341-2380, email:  jobrien@agi.com.  This sole source procurement is entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source, and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements.  AGI, a small business, is the only manufacturer of this item.	 Satellite Tool Kit (STK)® is a highly sophisticated suite of software products that provides the capability to interactively analyze aerospace (space based and ground based) systems through both tabular data and graphical displays. It allows the user to analyze launch vehicle trajectories, satellite positions, antenna pointing angles, access times, sensor field of view coverage, radar quality, communication link quality, close approaches, and hundreds of other functions. NASA Kennedy Space Center will be using this extensive set of capabilities for launch services mission analysis and visualization.  No other suppliers combine orbital mechanics and communications analysis tools in the same software product.	Any other software package would require a time-consuming and expensive modification to be suitable for intended NASA use. Several technical groups at KSC use STK and purchase of the same software package allows for data exchange between these users.	Any other package would be incompatible and make this exchange impossible without significant data translation.	 STK is produced and distributed exclusively by Analytical Graphics, Inc. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 3/25/2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center, on behalf of The Armed Forces Retirement Home-Washington D.C.  intends to award a sole source contract to Simplex Grinnell LP for fire alarm system upgrade. 

The upgrade and modification of the existing fire alarm system shall require the installation of a fiber optic network loop from the Main Security Building to the Scott Building and to the Sheridan Building. The fiber will be ran through the tunnels in new flex pipe to be installed. There will be a new voice panel installed in the new Security Building, which will be the master for all audio controls to buildings, which are compatible. Anew 4100U voice fire alarm system will replace the existing 2001 panel currently in the Scott Building. Both the new voice and the Scott’s voice panel will be tied into the campus network. Upon completion of this project the main Security Building will be able to page or send selected messages to the Scott and Sheridan Buildings.  The suite of sensor devices throughout the campus require Simplex 4100 system compatibility.  Anything less than Simplex 4100 compliant would have to be a stand alone system requiring stand alone panels, displays, sensors, dedicated cable runs to Security, dedicated spare parts on hand, and extra personal computer/monitor set-ups.
This upgrade requires the installation of equipment and electronic cards within the existing Simplex Fire Alarm System which are proprietary to Simplex and deemed to be available only from the original source. 

 NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than April 5, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference AFRW-73400-05-0015 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source purchase order award will be made to Simplex Grinnell LP, 9585 Snowden River Pkway, Columbia, Md 21046.

<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC) has a requirement to increase the  quantity of BLU-113 P3I (BLU-122) inert warhead load/maintenance trainers, provided as an option line item under contract F08635-03-C-0025, from 5 each to 11 each.  The contractor is required to fabricate, assemble, test, and deliver inert units for use as load or maintenance trainers.  Except for the fill material, the trainers shall replicate the characteristics of the live operational production assets.  The current quantity of 5 load trainers was previously established within the original solicitation for the BLU-113 P3I program that was competitively awarded to General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS, Inc.) on 9 June, 2003.  In order to perform this effort, a contractor must have detailed, intimate knowledge of the BLU-122 and associated production processes.  This is necessary because a level III reprocurement drawing package was not procured.  GD-OTS is the only known manufacturer capable of meeting all the Government's requirements at an affordable cost and within the program's schedule.  This synopsis is published as notification of the Government’s intent to procure the additional warhead maintenance trainers from GD-OTS as a sole-source modification to contract F08635-03-C-0025.  The Government will accept and evaluate information on other potential sources capable of delivering all the requirements for the trainers within the program schedule and at a reasonable price.  This synopsis is not an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to an award of contract; however, any proposals submitted as a result of this notification, and prior to any subsequent contract award, will be considered by the Contracting Officer.  This acquisition will utilize the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 332993, with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees.  For contractual information concerning this synopsis, please contact the Contracting Officer, Mr. Steve Wall, at (850) 882-3525, extension 3111.  For technical information, contact the Program Manager, Maj Steve Pearce, at (850) 882-3525, ext 2131.  Numbered Note #22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

A BOA is not a contract but is a written instrument of understanding between the COE and the firm to facili tate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  BOA holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA, and w ill constitute a separate contract with the issuance of an order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the COE to place future contracts or orders with the BOA hold er or to require that the COE solicit and acquire services from the BOA holders only. When the COE has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, we will provide written plans and specifications to all BOA holders along with a r equest for a proposal. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the BOA, but, if orders are placed, the minimum order amount will be $2,500.00 and the maximum will be $5,000,000.00. Evaluation criteria for a ward of the BOAs are past performance, bonding capacity, and principal place of business (with preference for Florida firms).  Bonding capacity will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  Interested firms must demonstrate ability to provide performance and pa yment bonds in the amount of $5,000,000.00.  Past performance will be evaluated on a best qualified basis.  Principal place of business will be used as a discriminator when otherwise equally qualified firms are being evaluated.  Assuming adequate response,  BOAs will be awarded to the two best qualified 8(a) firms, the two best qualified HUBZone firms, and the two best qualified SDVOSB firms.  If a firm is certified in more than one of the set-aside categories, the COE reserves the right to evaluate firms in  the manner the COE determines to be most equitable. Individual orders will be awarded to the BOA holder who has an acceptable record of performance under previous orders and whose price is the lowest.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK: Minor construction projects in t he state of Florida, which may include, but are not limited to, earthwork, seeding, grading, repairing of dikes and jetties, small dredging, installation of prefabricated buildings, concrete placement, stone placement, installation of mechanical and electr ical equipment, repair and installation of weir structures.  A solicitation will be issued on or about 06 April 2005 with submission due on or about 06 May 2005.  Solicitation will be issued in electronic format only and will be posted on our website.  Int erested qualified firms must register electronically.  If you are not registered, the Government is not responsible with providing you with notifications of any changes to this solicitation.

RADIATION DOSE ESTIMATES FROM
PLUTONIUM INTAKES

1.	OBJECTIVE
The main objective of the proposed work is to develop dose assessment methods and computational tools based on recently available toxicological information on plutonium and to estimate the organ doses for use in epidemiologic studies. 
The purpose this work is to provide support to epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to plutonium by inhalation, ingestion, or open wounds by: (1) estimating radiation organ doses from plutonium; and (2) quantifying uncertainties in dose estimates. 
The computational tools consist of computer software that allows the user to derive the intake of plutonium based on bioassay data (e.g., measured urine or fecal excretion rate), and then, by working from the intake forward, to reconstruct organ doses using contemporary biokinetic and dosimetric models.  The computer software will provide the capability of individual and batch (cohort) analysis, resulting in annual and committed organ doses with uncertainties.

 

 
Updates of the current ICRP plutonium systemic model are already emerging by analysis of data coming from two recent plutonium injection studies (the Harwell study; Talbot et al. 1993, 1997; Newton et al. 1998 and the NRPB study; Popplewell et al. 1994; Ham and Harrison 2000), from historical exposure of the Mayak workers (Khokhryakov et al. 1995, 2000; Suslova et al. 1996) and from the U.S. Transuranium and Uranium Registries (e.g., Ehrhart and Filipy 2001).  A number of modifications to the ICRP biokinetic model are now being proposed for addressing the biases described above (Eckerman KF 2003; personal communication).  
A post-ICRP systemic model has been developed and tested.  The post-ICRP model is expected to be more accurate than the ICRP model, but the ICRP systemic model is still considered the “gold standard”.  Thus, both models will be available for analysis of exposures.  The new post-ICRP model will be incorporated in the computer codes.
While other similar computer tools are available, this work represents an advancement of the state-of-the-art bioassay analysis and dose estimation for exposure to plutonium in the following areas:
1)	The computer codes performing intake determination by regression techniques can work in a batch mode, allowing analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates, or particle sizes of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
2)	A new post-ICRP biokinetic model based on analysis of recent plutonium data from the Harwell, NRPB, Mayak and USTUR studies, will be incorporated in our computer codes.  The structure of the current biokinetic model will be modified by adding or removing compartments and by adding or removing transfers among various model compartments.  
3)	In addition to the uncertainty in the doses to the lung tissues, the computer codes developed here will quantify the uncertainty in the doses to organs other than lung (e.g., bone surfaces, bone marrow, liver, kidney, bladder, and other soft tissues in general).

4.	PROPOSED TASKS, DELIVERABLES, AND SCHEDULE
TASK 1 – Determination of plutonium intake and organ doses
The objective of this task is to develop computer software that allows determination of the intake of plutonium based on available bioassay data (e.g., urine, feces, whole-body or lung counts) and then, starting from the determined intake, allows estimation doses for all organs of interest.  The most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP biokinetic models will be used to determine plutonium intake and to estimate organ doses.  The code will allow the user to analyze either one individual or multiple individuals (batch mode) at a time.  The activity of plutonium inhaled, ingested or taken from a contaminated wound will be determined assuming that the intake was either acute or continuous.  Both committed and annual organ doses will be reported.   To operate the code the user will provide the necessary information regarding exposure such as type of bioassay, number of data bioassay points, the actual bioassay data points, assumed exposure date, exposure characteristics (e.g., particle size and chemical form for inhalation). 
The software produced in Task 1 will represent the first version of the computer code for determination of intakes and dose estimation.  In this version, the uncertainties in the organ doses will be determined using published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston 2003; Goosens et al., 1998), with an emphasis on lung and red bone marrow doses.  
Note that the published studies on uncertainty ranges are either incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues), or inconclusive (i.e., the experts included in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium - Goossens et al. 1998).  Also, all studies on the uncertainty in doses from plutonium refer to the current ICRP biokinetic models (or earlier version), and not to the more recent post-ICRP model. 
A detailed quantification of uncertainties in organ doses is the subject of Task 2 presented below.
Task 1 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 1.A 		Development of a biokinetic database
Derivation of intake from an exposure to plutonium is performed using the intake retention and excretion functions (per unit intake – IRF/IEF).  The IRF/IEF functions can be calculated for any exposure conditions, by using the biokinetic model.  This sub-task will generate a database containing the IRF/IEF functions for given exposure conditions (e.g., inhalation of Type M and S plutonium attached to particles sizes 1 to 10 microns).  The intake determination portion of the computer code will use the IRF/IEF functions from this database to fit the bioassay data.
Note that the IRF/IEF functions for wound contamination depend on the treatment history of the wound.  A set of IRF/IEF functions will be provided to represent instantaneous and continuous transfers of plutonium to the blood stream.  The continuous transfer to the blood stream can be modeled assuming that the plutonium source was removed from the wound after, for instance, 30 days, 60 days or one year after the accident, and of course it can be modeled assuming that the source of plutonium has never been removed from the wound. 
Sub-Task 1.B		Development of a database of organ doses per unit intake
Plutonium organ doses are estimated starting with the intake determined from bioassay data analysis by using the ICRP and post-ICRP biokinetic and dosimetric models.  This task will pre-calculate a set of organ doses per unit intake for the same exposure conditions as those used in Sub-Task 1.A.  The organ dose from a determined intake will simply be estimated as the intake multiplied by the dose per unit intake.  This will ensure an efficient way of estimating doses, by eliminating the need of running the biokinetic and dosimetry codes for each exposure case analyzed. 
The organ doses per unit intake included in the database will use published uncertainty ranges (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998). 
Sub-Task 1.C	Development of the computer code for intake determination and dose estimation
This sub-task focuses on the actual programming of the computer code to be used for intake determination from bioassay data analysis and estimation of organ doses from the determined intake.  This code will make use of the two databases developed for Sub-Tasks 1 and 2.
Weighted least-square regression will be used to determine intake.  This method is equivalent to the maximum likelihood method.  Regression techniques are useful for routine determination of intake in cases of single acute exposures or constant continuous exposures.  The equations used to derive the intake are similar to the ones used in the CINDY internal dosimetry computer code (Strenge et al. 1993).  
The computer code will be set up to allow analysis of multiple cases in the same run.  This feature is useful for performing multiple runs for the same individual (e.g., for different exposure dates or for different chemical forms of inhaled plutonium), or for performing runs for a set of individuals with similar exposures.
As discussed above, the uncertainties in the estimated doses will be based on published uncertainty ranges in the organ dose factors.
The computer code will be programmed in Analytica® programming language (Analytica 2003).  The Analytica® computer code will interact with Microsoft Access database where the bioassay data can be stored.  The main advantages of using this programming platform are (a) good interaction with a well-developed database management software, (b) availability in Analytica® of a powerful Monte-Carlo engine for proper error propagation, and (c) user-friendly interfaces.  
Sub-Task 1.D		Documentation of the computer software
The computer code will be self-documented.  A short technical documentation, however, will be provided in form of a report.  The technical documentation will briefly describe the techniques used to determine intake and estimate doses, and will discuss the choices of the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake from the existing, published values.  In addition, the documentation will include basic guidance for a user operating the code. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 1
Sub-tasks 1.A to 1.D represent milestones in completing Task 1.  The main deliverables for Task 1 are the version 1.0 of the computer software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses and it’s technical documentation.  The databases developed in sub-Tasks 1.A and 1.B will be provided as part of the final computer code.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the computer software.  
SCHEDULE for TASK 1 
Task 1 will start at the beginning of the project and will be completed within 6 months.  

TASK 2 – Quantification of uncertainty in organ doses
Various attempts of quantification of uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation or ingestion of plutonium have been done in the past (Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003; Goosens et al. 1998).  Some published studies are incomplete (e.g., Huston 1995, Farfan et al. 2003 and Huston et al. 2003 considered doses to only the respiratory tract tissues).  Other studies are inconclusive.  For instance, the experts participating in the European Community expert elicitation do not agree regarding the magnitude of the uncertainty in the doses from plutonium (Goossens et al. 1998).  The uncertainty in the red bone marrow doses from inhalation of plutonium is listed as uncertainty range of 10 by some experts (95th/5th percentile ratio), while others state that it can be larger than a factor of 100.  All studies on uncertainty in doses from plutonium have been done using the current ICRP or older biokinetic models.  The uncertainties in the organ doses based on the more recent post-ICRP biokinetic model have not been estimated.  Also, no uncertainties in dose due to wound contamination have been estimated. 
The purpose of this task is to determine the uncertainties in the organ doses from inhalation, ingestion and wound contamination with plutonium.  Uncertainties will be estimated for tissues of the respiratory tract (including lung) and for all other organs of the body in the ICRP list of organs.  
The uncertainties in the dose per unit intake will be incorporated in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above), so that the computer code developed in Task 1 will report both doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
Task 2 will have the following sub-tasks:
Sub-Task 2.A		Uncertainties in the plutonium biokinetic and dosimetric model
The purpose of this sub-task is to quantify the uncertainties in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model, for both the most recent ICRP and the post-ICRP model.  
Uncertainties in the parameters of the respiratory tract portion of the biokinetic model have been determined and documented by Huston (1995) and other publications following-up on his work (Bolch et al. 2001; Bolch et al. 2003; Farfan et al. 2003; Huston et al. 2003).  This task will use the information already available for the respiratory tract, and will focus on determination of uncertainties in the parameters of systemic part of the biokinetic model. 
The uncertainties in the organ doses will be derived by assigning probability distributions functions as a description of the uncertainty in each parameter of the biokinetic and dosimetric model.  The uncertainties in the parameters will be propagated using Monte-Carlo methods for error propagation.  
Sub-Task 2.B		Quantifying the uncertainties in the organ doses per unit intake
The purpose of this sub-task is to generate dose-per-unit-intake dose coefficients for all necessary exposure conditions and incorporate them in the database of dose-per-unit-intake coefficients (see sub-Task 1.B above).  This will allow the computer code developed in Task 1 to report doses and associated uncertainties, with the necessary correlations between annual doses. 
DELIVERABLES for TASK 2
Sub-tasks 2.A and 2.B are milestones for Task 2.  The main deliverable of Task 2 is version 2.0 of the software for determination of intakes and estimation of doses.  This version will contain uncertainty ranges for organ doses resulting from a rigorous treatment of the uncertainty in the biokinetic and dosimetric model for plutonium.  The updated technical documentation will include details of the new treatment of uncertainties.  
Short progress reports will be delivered to NIOSH every two months.  
A representative of SENES Oak Ridge, Inc. will travel to NIOSH to deliver and demonstrate the software. 
SCHEDULE for TASK 2
Task 2 will start after Task 1 is completed and it is estimated that it will take 6 months to complete it.  Thus, the second version of the software will thus be completed about 1 year from the beginning of the project.

 Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above. To be consdered qualfied, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess the ability to deliver the kind of activity outlined in the statement of work including the following:  The scope supports continuing epidemiologic study by developing retrospective dose assessment methods and computational tools for quantitative estimates of dose from uptake of various plutonium-bearing compounds that are likely in the workplace.  Potential bidders will need a computational tool(s) shall consist of computer software that allows the user to derive the intake of plutonium based on bioassay data (e.g., measured urine or fecal excretion rate), and then, by working from the intake forward, reconstruct organ doses using contemporary biokinetic and dosimetric models.  The computer software will provide the capability of individual and batch (cohort) analysis, resulting in annual and committed organ doses with uncertainties.  The uncertainties in the estimated organ doses shall be quantified by Monte-Carlo error propagation of the uncertainties in each model parameter
The proposed work shall provide an efficient means to estimate tissue doses for individual workers and allow processing a large number of workers in a batch mode.  Derivation of intake will be based on weighted least-square regression methods.  Both derivation of intake and derivation of organ doses shall rely on the most recent biokinetic models for inhalation and ingestion of plutonium (ICRP 1993, 1994).  In addition, provisions shall be incorporated for selecting modeling parameters associated with the emerging post-ICRP biokinetic models based on analysis of recent plutonium data from the Harwell, NRPB, Mayak and USTUR studies.  
Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later then fifteen (15) days from the date of this annoucement.  Submit written information to: Dwight D. Favors, MS-C4, Reference: 2004-N-01337, DHHS/PHS/CDC, 4676 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45226, or responses may be submitted electronically to Dwight Favors at dyf3@cdc.gov.

We will update this  announcement by posting the questions and our responses in a Bidders Library  that will be placed at the end of this announcement.  This acquisition involves data that are subject to export control laws and  regulations.  It has been determined that foreign companies will not be  permitted to participate in this acquisition at the prime contract level.   Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics  Services Center (DLSC) +http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/+ and have a legitimate  business purpose may participate in this solicitation. Contact the Defense  Logistics Services Center, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan  40917-3084 (1-800-352-3572) for further information on the certification  process. You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services 
The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization of the existing A. J. Celebrezze Federal Building in Cleveland, Ohio.  The A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building was constructed in 1966 and is a 32 story office tower located in the northeast section of downtown Cleveland on a plot of land bound by Lakeside Avenue on the north, East Ninth Street on the east and East Sixth Street on the west. The total building gross square footage is approximately 1,462,628 square feet; this includes the two basement levels and the 32 floors above grade. The office tower is set back approximately 121 feet from East Ninth and 29 feet from Lakeside Avenue. At ground level, the building is adjoined on all fours sides by public Plaza’s and landscaped with granite pavers and planting areas. The scope of the CMc services under this proposed contract includes Pre-Construction Phase Services and a unilateral option for Construction Phase Services.  A firm, fixed-price contract is contemplated.  The Government intends to evaluate price proposals according to the CMc’s cost of Pre-Construction Phase Services as the Base Contract and Construction Phase Services as an Option.  The Government contemplates the Option pricing will be broken down, for evaluation purposes, into prices corresponding to: Construction Phase Construction Management Services, General Construction, Profit, Overhead, Daily Delay Rate, Subcontractor Commission, and General Conditions. A firm, fixed-price based upon the general construction services required will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction Phase Option.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3).  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.  
Project Summary:  Selection of the CMc – type firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations, source selection procedures and the “Best Value Trade-Off” process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation. As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase, the CMc shall work with the A E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: preliminary evaluation of design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, resolving problems, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews and performing administrative and other services as defined in this scope of work, in addition to other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility.  For the Construction Phase of this project, the major work items include the Restoration of the Exterior Building Plaza, Installation of a New Fire Life Safety System and Upgrading Existing HVAC and Building Automation Systems. Construction will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction process.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants. The Total Estimated Construction Cost range is $25 million to $40 million.  Of the Total Estimated Construction Cost, the Plaza portion of the work is estimated to be in the $12 to $15 million range and the HVAC and Fire Life Safety work is estimated to be in the same $12 to $15 million range. The construction duration will be approximately 30 months. This amount or duration does not include Pre-Construction Phase services (Base Contract). CURRENTLY FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE BASE CONTRACT. 
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc (also known as AGS Document 565) and “Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor”.
Proposal Submission Requirements:  Proposals will be evaluated using the Source Selection Best Value Process.  Offerors must submit information addressing the technical evaluation factors identified in the Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be evaluated by the Source Selection Board as well as pre-construction fees (base award) and a guaranteed maximum price for construction (option).  With a competitive range established, the most qualified firms will then be invited to deliver an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, IL.  A “best value, trade-off” process will determine which offer is in the best interests of the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without conducting negotiations.

Technical Evaluation Factors:  Proposals will be evaluated using a two stage, source selection process.  Under Stage 1, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past experience, past performance, personnel, and management plan.  Submissions shall clearly address the evaluation factors identified in the Stage 1 Request for Proposal (RFP) as well as pricing for pre-construction and contruction.  The evaluation factors stated in the RFP represent the factors that will be used by the Source Selection Board in evaluation and determination of a competitive range of firms.  A competitive range of the most highly qualified firms will then be invited to deliver oral presentations for Stage 2. Firms determined to be in the competitive range shall participate in an oral presentation that will take place in Chicago, Illinois. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without holding discussions.  

Contract Award:  The base contract will be awarded to the selected firm to provide Pre-construction Phase services.  Option prices will be accepted for Construction Phase services at the time of the base contract award, but will be negotiated once design documents are completed.

Small Business Participation:  This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220, and the corresponding size standard for determining whether or not a firm qualifies as a small business is $28.5 million in average, annual receipts (gross) over the past three years.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small firms (including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, Veteran-Owned small firms, and service disabled Veteran-Owned business) are strongly encouraged to participate in the construction and renovation of Federal facilities.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, ALL firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local (Cleveland area) business concern participation.  Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one type written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms.  In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern and/or a small disadvantaged business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.  Please refer to the SBA website for details at www.sba.gov.  
Joint Ventures:  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO STATE THAT CAPABILITIES STATEMENTS ARE NOW DUE BY JUNE 6, 2005; STATEMENTS OF INTEREST ARE NOW DUE MAY 23, 2005; AND THAT IN THIS CASE, ONE OF THE MATERIALS THAT NIH WILL CONTRIBUTE WILL BE CLINICAL TRIAL DATA FROM AN RFA USING SILYMARIN FOR LIVER DISEASES.<BR>

<B>DESCRIPTION:</b> The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)  and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seek collaboration with industry to participate in the Silymarin Product Development Program for use of silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant Silybum marianum, in NIH-sponsored clinical trials for liver diseases.<BR> 

<B>INTRODUCTION:</b> 

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), in collaboration with other components of the National Institutes of Health of the U.S Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institute of Diabetes and  Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is planning to form a Silymarin Product Development Program (PDP) and a Silymarin Research Network for Phase II clinical trials using silymarin, derived from the milk thistle plant Silybum marianum, for liver diseases.  The initial stage of the Silymarin PDP presently is planned to consist of  Phase I/II dose-ranging studies for silymarin in one or more of the following indications: chronic hepatitis C or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.  In addition, Phase I drug-drug interaction studies are planned. The total number of clinical trials to be performed in the initial stage of the PDP depends on the following factors: publication of a Request for Applications (RFA) for principal investigators to propose such studies; peer review of the applications by the NIH peer review system; and further evaluation and changes in the peer-accepted protocols by an NIH Silymarin Research Network Steering Committee. The second stage of the Silymarin PDP would consist of a Phase III pivotal trial of silymarin for one chosen clinical indication. 
<BR>
A decision point will occur after the initial stage of the Silymarin PDP. If the data from the Phase I /II trials suggest that proceeding to Phase III is appropriate, NCCAM, NIDDK and other NIH Institutes or Centers that may become involved, with the input of the selected Collaborator, are expected to plan a Phase III pivotal trial. 
<BR>
Therefore, NCCAM and NIDDK are seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies to enter into a collaboration to provide silymarin to support the Silymarin Product Development Program and the Silymarin Research Network. The selected Collaborator will be expected to enter into a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) with NCCAM. To facilitate the exchange of information regarding the PDP among the NIH components and the Collaborator, the selected Collaborator will also be expected to enter into an appropriate Confidential Disclosure Agreement preliminary to finalizing a CTA.
<BR>
<B>STUDY GOALS:</b> The overall goal of the Silymarin Product Development Program is to evaluate a silymarin formulation for treatment or prevention or progression of hepatic disorders. It is unclear at this time if any or all of the disorders, chronic hepatitis C and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, can be effectively aided by silymarin. Therefore, the initial stage of the silymarin PDP is to perform Phase I/II dose-ranging trials, and associated supportive Phase I studies, in whichever of these disorders can be reasonably studied. When the results of the initial stage of the Silymarin PDP are evaluated, a decision will be made by NCCAM, NIDDK and any other NIH Institutes or Centers that may be involved, with Collaborator's input, as to whether a Phase III pivotal trial for any indication is warranted.
<BR>
<B>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:</b> The determination as to which disorders should be investigated will be made through the NIH process of publication of an RFA, reception of protocols in response to the RFA, peer-review of the proposed protocols, and further refinement of the protocols by the Silymarin Research Network Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will consist of the PIs of the several successful applications for the Silymarin Research network which may include up to 5 Clinical Centers and a single Data Coordinating Center.  In addition, the Steering Committee will include NIH personnel, and may include the Collaborator as a non-voting member. The protocols contained in the successful applications for the Silymarin Research Network will be refined and finalized by the Steering Committee during the first year of the awarded Network. The protocols will then be implemented during years 2 and 3 of the Network.
<BR>
The Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) into which the selected Collaborator is expected to enter is an agreement designed to enable a collaboration between Government laboratories and industry. IT IS NOT A GRANT, AND IS NOT A CONTRACT FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF GOODS OR SERVICES.  The NIH is prohibited from transferring funds to a CTA collaborator. Under a CTA, NIH can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. In this case, one of the materials that NIH will contribute will be clinical trial data from an RFA using Silymarin for liver diseases. The Collaborator typically contributes materials and expertise to the collaboration. This will be an in-kind collaborative arrangement.
<BR>
<B>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:</b> A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the "Collaborator Capability Statements" received in response to this announcement to help in its selection of Industry Collaborator. It is the intention of the NCCAM and NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  All Capability Statements will be reviewed by a scientific review panel.
<BR>
The review panel will be considering its selection based upon data in the Capability Statement addressing the following criteria A-H. If no data is available, the potential Collaborator should so indicate. 
<BR>
A. CMC CRITERIA

In general, the details should be in conformity with FDA's expert advice with respect to acceptability for a pivotal trial. See for reference: "Botanical Drug Products" Guidance for Industry CDER, FDA, June 2004.

In particular:
<BR>
1. Botanical raw material:	Description, spectroscopic and/or chromatographic fingerprint, material processor, preparation of the raw material, quality control tests and analytical procedures, voucher specimen, certificate of analysis of the raw material, storage conditions.

2. Botanical drug substance:	Description, chemical identification for active constituents and characteristic markers, specifications, manufacturing process, quality control tests, analytical procedures validation, reference standard, batch analysis, container, stability, container label.

3. Botanical drug product:	Description, acceptance specifications, manufacturing process, quality control tests, validation reports of analytical procedures, batch analysis, container, stability.

4. Placebo

5. Labeling

6. Environmental assessment or claim of exclusion
<BR>
B. NON-CLINICAL CRITERIA

1. Nonclinical data suggesting safety and efficacy of the product for treating chronic liver disease including hepatitis C and/or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Nonclinical data would normally include: efficacy in vitro and in animal models; toxicity after single and multiple doses in two species; reproductive toxicity in females and in males; mutagenicity/genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo; carcinogenicity data if available; plasma levels of parent compounds and metabolites corresponding to acute and chronic toxicity.

Because silymarin will be clinically administered for up to 1 year or more in the Phase II and eventual Phase III studies, chronic toxicity studies (with reversal) should be at least 3 months in duration and if possible 6 months in rodents and 9 months in non-rodents. Special pharmacology/toxicology studies, such as cardiovascular toxicity, neurological toxicity, and toxicity to indicated target organs, would be highly desirable. 

2. Additionally, any available absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data should be submitted.  
<BR> 
C. CLINICAL DATA

1.  Clinical data suggesting safety and efficacy of the product for treating or preventing the progression of  liver disease due to hepatitis (viral, alcoholic, or drug-induced) and/or steatosis.         

2. Additionally, any available human absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion data, in normal and in hepatic-compromised populations, should be submitted.  Drug-drug interaction studies are highly desirable.

3. Instructions for use.
<BR>
D. REGULATORY DATA

1. A copy of an Investigator Brochure for the product.

2. A list of the countries where your product(s) is in clinical testing or has been approved or marketed, if appropriate. 

3. Whether there is an IND or Drug Master File (DMF) on file with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Please indicate when you filed the application and the current status of the IND or DMF. If you do not have an IND or DMF currently on file with the FDA, please indicate whether you will agree to submit sufficient and appropriate Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) documentation so that an IND can be filed by NCCAM. 
<BR>
E. ABILITY TO SUPPLY PRODUCT FOR PHASE I /II IND STUDIES

1. The manufacturer must be able to supply sufficient quantity of the formulated silymarin and matching placebo(s) within proposed specifications for the duration of the clinical trial. For this initial inquiry, manufacturers should assume that in Phase I/II trials, there will be a total of approximately 400-500 patients receiving silymarin daily for up to 6-to-12 months, and the daily dose will range from approximately 160 mg three times daily to approximately 640 mg three times daily. 

2. Manufacturing capacity (batch size) for the product.

3. Please indicate when the appropriately packaged final formulation of silymarin could be made available to the NIH for use in clinical studies. 
<BR>
F.ABILITY TO SUPPLY PRODUCT FOR PHASE III PIVOTAL TRIALS

If Phase II and other supporting studies suggest to the NIH, with Collaborator's input, that a Phase III trial for a clinical indication is appropriate, ability to supply product for approximately 2000 patients administered silymarin, in dosages to be determined, but possibly 320-to-640 mg 3-times-a-day, for 2 years.
<BR>
G. ABILITY TO PROVIDE OTHER SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL TRIALS

1. Pharmacokinetic support: assay of silymarin levels in plasma samples drawn from patients in Phase II studies.

2. Other clinical trial support

INVENTION SUMMARY: High Capacity Arsenic Resin - The EPA has recently set a new drinking water standard for arsenic. The new standard, which becomes effective in 2006, reduces the MCL for arsenic from 50 to 10 micrograms/liter. A novel resin technology has been developed by combining hydrated metal oxide nanoparticles with a polymer to form beads for use in a bed or cartridge. Very high loadings of the metal oxide have been achieved, resulting in an inexpensive composite with an active adsorption surface area of approximately three hundred square meters per gram (300 m2/g) of resin. Preliminary testing has shown the material to have very high equilibrium loadings for arsenic at the low concentration ranges typically found in groundwater. It has also been shown to maintain selectivity for oxy-anion and neutral arsenic species in the presence of potentially competing anions. This material is especially applicable to removal of indigenous arsenic contamination from drinking water, but would also have application for treating and remediating contaminated waters resulting from industrial activities such as mining. Primary benefits of this high capacity arsenic removal resin would be removal of arsenic contamination in potable water supplies. This material could be used in a single pass operation, wherein the material would be loaded with arsenic to maximum capacity and then disposed in a landfill, since it is anticipated that arsenic loaded resins will meet the Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure (TCLP) criteria.  Resins can be incorporated into municipal water treatment systems; used as a disposable cartridge on private wells; or on drinking water faucets in private residences.   While disposable, the resins can also be regenerated with alkaline solutions and re-used if this is deemed a more economical approach.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Northeast and Caribbean Region is pleased to announce an opportunity for Construction Excellence for the Infrastructure Upgrade of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse located at 40 Centre Street, New York, NY.  The project will involve three phases of construction including Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazmat Abatement, Exterior Closure Repairs and Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP) and Interiors work.  The scope of services will include all preconstruction services including, but not limited to; estimating, scheduling, value engineering, constructability, drawing completeness and coordination reviews.  Optional services will include construction of the project.   This project is being designed by the firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, Architects and Planners of NYC.

The Thurgood Marshal U.S. Courthouse was designed by Cass Gilbert and opened in 1936.  The courthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a New York City Landmark. The 718,180 gross square foot building is located in the Civic Center of Lower Manhattan near the entrance to the Brooklyn Bridge.   The courthouse houses approximately 600 federal employees who work for both the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  This courthouse consists of a 6-story base a 26-story tower, which includes two mechanical floors at the top of the tower and one in the basement.  The courthouse contains twenty-three courtrooms, forty-four judges’ chambers and court-related office spaces.  GSA and the US Courts have jointly agreed to vacate the courthouse in order to perform a single infrastructure upgrade project consisting of three Phases. 

The schedule for each construction phase is as follows:   Award of the Selective Demolition and Hazmat Abatement and the Exterior Closure Repairs is anticipated during the Fall of 2006. Award of the MEP and Interiors work is anticipated in January of 2008.

The Overall Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is $145,000,000 to $152,000,000, and is broken out for each phase of construction as follows:  Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazmat Abatement: $ 5,000,000 - $6,000,000; Exterior Closure Repairs:  $ 20,000,000 - $23,000,000;  MEP/Interior Work: $ 120,000,000 – $123,000,000.

Through the Construction Excellence program, GSA will employ the best practices that will result in the best project for the best value; Procure the highest quality construction services as early as practical; and Establish reliable budgets and the ability to manage them. 

GSA is actively seeking General Contractors who can provide full Construction Services for this project through a procurement method developed in accordance with FAR Part 15.1 – Source Selection Processes and Techniques.  This will be a competitive acquisition, utilizing the Tradeoff process approach under the Best Value Continuum.  This process will allow tradeoffs among cost and price and technical factors and allows the government the ability to accept other than the lowest priced proposal, if feasible.  Through this process, following initial evaluations, in accordance with FAR 15.306c(2), GSA will limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  For this project, the competitive range will be limited to the three (3) most highly rated General Contractors, who will be invited to continue through the remainder of procurement process.

GSA intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price contract for the following services:  Constructability Review and Value Engineering of Construction Documents at various design phases, with an Option for Construction of the following: Selective Bulk Demolition and Hazmat Abatement and Exterior Closure Repairs and an Option for MEP and Interiors construction work. 

The Technical Criteria is presently being developed for this project. However for your information, the Past Experience criteria will require that one of three projects have been a modernization/renovation completed within the past ten years in a building listed or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places or listed as a New York City landmark with construction costs of $50,000,000 or greater. 

As this is a Sources Sought announcement, GSA would like all General Contractors interested in pursuing this project to submit a Written Letter of Interest to Joan Ryan, Contracting Officer, GSA.  This can be done via fax at 212-264-0588 or through email to joan.ryan@gsa.gov or winnie.eng@gsa.gov.

<DESC>“This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane.” MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide COTS, NDI, or near NDI component technologies that can be incorporated into an improved crew served weapons mount (ICSWM) for small arms. The United States Special Operations Command intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (http://cto.acqcenter.com/dac/bids/nsf) to evaluate candidate items. The government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria. Further, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field the ICSWM to meet military operational needs. The crew served weapons mount must be capable of mounting the General Dynamics' Advanced Lightweight Grenade Launcher (ALGL) MK47 MOD 0 40mm machine gun, with secondary applications to mount the M2 .50 caliber machine gun and M240 7.62mm m! achine gun using adapters. The deliverables will be 1/EA Improved Crew Served Weapons Mount for Government test and evaluation. The successful contractor will provide engineering support during demonstration, testing, and user evaluation. A detailed schedule for the efforts listed above shall be developed between the contractor in coordination with General Dynamics Armaments & Technical Products, and the Government. The Improved Crew Served Weapon Mount is envisioned as a non-stabilized mount using soft mount technology. This technology should provide for improved slew and firing capability to fire from moving platforms (vehicles and watercraft). Vendors must have a non-developmental /commercial MK47 / M2 / M240 small arms mount with the following features: 1) The mount must have a Quick Slewing capability providing for both major shifts in azimuth and elevation in a free gun mode.  2) The mount must provide for sufficient mounting surfaces to incorporate common interface br! ackets (MIL-STD-1913, etc) for fire-control devices. 3) The mount must provide for recoil buffers for MK47 / M2 / M240 weapons to isolate any sights or other gear affixed to the cradle. 4) The mount must provide common control surfaces (grips, trigger, azimuth, and elevation controls) and allow the operator to (a) trigger the weapon by using controls on the grips (b) dial-in a programming range. 5) The mount must include a trigger linkage to interface the weapon and mount in such a way as to allow for removal and installation of MK47 / M2 / M240 weapons in the mount by the gun crew in a field environment without tools. 6) The mount must interface directly with the MK47 MOD 0 machine gun and may have adapters to interface with the M2 and M240 machine guns. The following Key Performance Parameters must be met:  7) Weight - The heaviest component will not exceed 39 pounds.  8) Ammunition/Function - The MK47 integrated with the ICSWM will fire all current stocks of ammunition ty! pe classified by the US and NATO that are currently fired by the MK19 MOD3.  9) Mounting - Be capable of being fired from the MK195 MOD0 vehicle adapter in ring and pedestal mounts for mounted operation (i.e., M1025 Tactical Vehicle/Desert Mobility).  10) Movement Control - The operator must be able to safely control the weapon while firing on the move on level terrain and ICSWM will not present any uncontrollable safety or health hazards to personnel.  11) Ballistic Shielding - ICSWM will have ballistic shielding that provides the gunner frontal ballistic protection against 7.62 X 51 (M80) ball ammunition.  12) Traverse and Elevation Control - The mount will have a quick, simple and easy traverse and elevation control that meets current range of motion of MK93 (15 degrees below horizontal to 60 degrees above horizontal when vehicle mounted in MK195). 13) Operability - The ICSWM must be operable by personnel wearing protective equipment required for (NBC) environments and co! ld weather operations.  14) Ammo Bracket Assembly - ICSWM will have a bracket to fit standard ammunition containers PA120, M549 and PA70.  Ammo bracket must not cause ammo belt twisting leading to gun stoppage within fill range of motion. Responsive vendors should have extensive experience with weapon systems integration and the design of military weapon mounts, electronic circuits, ballistic protection/shields for function in the Special Operation Forces environment and also have capabilities including all equipment and test ranges to measure firing loads to adapt the current commercial mount to full functionality with the MK47, M2 and M240 machine guns. The vendor must also have a license from Nordic Ammunition Company, Raufoss, Norway (NAMMO AS) to use their proprietary MK438 fuze technology allowing them to transmit the signal to the MK285 cartridge. Responses are requested from suppliers who can provide working hardware ready for test and demonstration purposes on or ab! out 20 NOV 2005. Responses to this market survey are due on or before 5 April 2005, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units. Interested parties should submit data of the item to Naval Surface Warfare Center; Crane Division; Attn: Code 0562NH, (John Pfender)/B. 2521, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522. Questions may be submitted in writing to the above address, or email john.pfender@navy.mil. No further information is available from the Procuring Office.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Pod mounted, high performance surface search radar
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HBSS0001
<RESPDATE>042005
<ARCHDATE>05052005
<CONTACT>Stephen Lucianetti, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-9743, Fax (301) 342-1864, Email lucianettisj@navair.navy.mil
<DESC>NAVAIR is seeking information on producing a pod mounted, high performance surface search radar that is flight cleared for mounting onto the port outboard wing station of the C130 E/H/J/T aircraft. NAVAIR needs a pod mounted high performance search radar, with SAR, ISAR, and MTI, that can be rapidly installed or uninstalled with minimal aircraft modification.  The only airframe modifications desired are NAVAIR installed cabling runs to the wing station.  The operator stations would be on a NAVAIR pallet mounted in the cargo bay.

NAVAIR requires a system that can meet or exceed the parameters listed below.  Ideally the preferred solution would be an integrated pod/radar system; however, NAVAIR understand that some radar manufactures may not be able to accomplish this.  NAVAIR will give serious consideration to radar only submissions – radar performance is the key factor for this RFI.

A white paper with bullets listing the features and tabulated performance data is the preferred format.

1.  Pod
A)  Radar can operate indefinitely in a non-pressurized pod environment to an altitude of 40,000Ft.

B)  Radar may be side looking, forward looking, or mounted on the bottom of the pod with 360 degree field of view.  Masking of the radar will be required for Crew Safety.

C)  Pod radar system will meet or exceed NAVAIR flight clearance requirements for land based aircraft.  NAVAIR flight clearances for the C130 E/H/J/T models will be required.   A complete flight clearance data package is required for each model.

D)  Complete level 3 design and clearance data package for the pod will be provided to NAVAIR as a CDRL.

E)  Pod will be designed to occupy the outboard port wing station, number 330.1.

F)  All cooling and heating requirements for the radar must be completely contained within the pod.

G)  Power for the pod will be supplied via NAVAIR installed wing wiring.

H)  INS and GPS data will be provided to the pod via an independent GPS/INS (LN 100G) feeding a 1553 data bus that is independent from the aircraft’s data bus.  No aircraft data bus interface will be required.

I)  A plot of radar field of view will be generated for the outer port wing station number 330.1.

2.  Radar
The radar will have the following general performance parameters:
A)  ISAR mode
Target resolution in the maritime or terrestrial ISAR mode shall be 
at least one (1) foot (Threshold).

B)  Synthetic Aperture Radar Mode
The radar shall have a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode.  Resolution shall be no greater then one (1) foot.  Range shall be no less than 50NM operating at altitudes of 40,000Ft.

C)  MTI
The radar will have ground MTI and maritime MTI capability.  For ground MTI minimum detectable radial velocities of 5 Kts are desired (Threshold).  Maritime MTI mode should be able to detect medium surface craft traveling at speeds of 5 kts or greater in sea states up to 3 at ranges up to 50 NM.

D)  Surface Search Modes
The radar shall have a wide area search mode and a periscope detection mode.

E)  Radar will be able to detect medium surface targets with 8m2 RCS at 5000 feet altitude, sea state 3, PD=.9 at a range of 50nm.  Assume no precipitation and no multi-path.

F)  Air to Air detection and tracking against Cessna sized aircraft at ranges of 50NM and velocities of 75-500 Kts is highly desirable. (Objective).

G)  Radar will also have to meet the following performance criteria:
 
Contact Characteristics    Detect1 Slant     Classify1 Slant 
                           Range Note 1      Range Note 1
			     (nm/feet)        (nm/feet)        
Vessels greater than 150     200/27,000	      100/27,000	
 feet in length 3

Vessels greater than 50 but
less than 150 feet in length 3	75/10,000	50/10,000

Vessels greater than 15 but 	50/5,000	25/5,000
less than 50 feet in length 3

Life Raft (with 1 person) 2	25/2,000	   N/A 4

Notes:
1. Sea state 3, 90% probability of detection required. Detection and classification altitudes are thresholds.  
2. Six to eight person life raft with 1 person in raft
3. Vessel category representatives:
B.	15-50' category - a 30ft “Wellcraft Scarab” (fiberglass hull w/center console) with twin 200+ HP outboards
C.	50-150' category - a 100' steel hull western rig fishing trawler
D.	>150' category - a 200' steel hull, aft superstructure coastal freighter
4. Objective requirement of 5/2,000 (nm/feet) for this category

 H)  Radar Target Designation
The radar shall provide the means in the surface search mode for the operator to designate a target for tracking.

I)  Radar Track-While-Scan
The radar shall have a track-while-scan capability of up to 30 targets.

J)  Search and Rescue Radar Transponder Detection
The radar shall be capable of detecting and displaying the relative bearing to Search and Rescue Radar Transponder (SART) signals within 10 nm slant range.

K)  Radar Composite Accuracy
The composite positional accuracy of the target displayed on the radar shall be within 100 meters at 5 nautical miles slant range.

L)  Radar formats
Radar will output digital data in standard DOD or Commercial formats.  Radar will output the MTI dots in near real time NMTI/GMTI format.  Radar will have the ability to capture snapshots of the screen in populated NITF 2.1 format.

M)  Radar cuing
The radar will be able to cue other sensors via 1553 and Ethernet.

N)  Radar I/O
Radar will utilize Ethernet as primary data bus.  Control will be via 1553 or Ethernet.

O)  Appropriate control software will be provided.  WinXP based software is preferred.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  This is not a solicitation; this is a sources sought synopsis only.  NSF intends to solicit this project as a Small Business Set Aside.  However, for the purposes of this sources sought, all capable business sizes may respond.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources for the fabrication and instillation of library shelving.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 337215 Showcase, Partition, Shelving, and Locker Manufacturing.  The size standard is 500 employees.  



Requirement Description:  NSF is looking to maximize the storage capacity of its 980 sq ft (8'6"x36'5"x24'7") library.  This objective can be achieved through redesign of the area, new shelving alternatives or a combination of both.  The library anticipates a growth rate of 5% per year.  The floor load capacity throughout the library was designed to carry 200 P.S.F.    NSF is seeking companies that can propose the best alternative to achieve the objective.  


A site-visit for this requirement has been scheduled for Tuesday March 29, 2005, at 10:00 a.m. for all interested parties.  Please contact the contracting officer identified in this notice to register.  Any questions must be submitted in writing and will be incorporated into the subsequent solicitation.  


NSF’s physical collection contains approximately 20,000 books, videos, and periodicals, approximately 1,500 cassettes and approximately 50,000 microfiche.  The library welcomes approximately 7,800 NSF staff on an annual basis and a minimal number of visitors from the public sector.  NSF displays one year’s worth of 180 printed journals, as well as displaying five newspapers for 28 days.  The library currently has 14 banks of magazine display shelves; 4 ranges of 9 banks each with 6 shelves per bank, 4 ranges of 7 banks each with 6 shelves per bank.  There are 12 banks of reference materials in various locations; one locking cabinet with six shelves of video materials, expansion is needed in this area.  Microfilm is maintained in one cabinet with 12 drawers, 5 rows per drawer, maximum capacity is 26 cassettes per row.  Microfiche is maintained in one cabinet with 12" deep rows, 6 rows per shelf, 12 shelves; and one cabinet with 24"deep drawers, 2 rows per drawer, 4 drawers.  Neither the microfilm nor the microfiche collections are expected to grow.  NSF expects growth in the area of CDs and DVDs.  The primary objective of this sources sought notice is to identify companies that can provide effective options to increase storage capabilities.  However, this requirement also includes the installation of the solution, which will require the unloading, storing and accurate reloading of the library materials within a short specific timeframe.  Please be aware of this when assessing company capability to perform this work.
  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to the North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS), DUNS number, and a schedule number, if services are on a FSS.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to participate in a joint research project under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop a thermochemical cycle for the production of hydrogen.  The Hybrid Sulfur Process was first developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the 1970s and 1980s.  This process is one of a family of sulfur-based, closed-loop reaction cycles that have been proposed for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using thermal energy.  Westinghouse’s early development effort progressed through a laboratory demonstration.  SRNL has recently updated the Hybrid Sulfur Process flowsheet to today’s design standards, resulting in improved estimated net thermal efficiencies.  SRNL is seeking industry partners to participate in a cooperative research and development project that would include laboratory-scale demonstration and evaluation of key process components, optimization of process design and operating parameters, and closed-cycle laboratory-scale demonstration.  Initial efforts would lead to scale-up and testing of an SO2-depolarized electrolyzer, a key component in the Hybrid Sulfur Process.  The goal of this joint research project, expected to last about three and a half years, is to complete sufficient design and proof-of-concept testing to advance the technology to the point of readiness for pilot-scale (about 1 MW energy input) plant construction and testing.  If successfully demonstrated under this joint research project, the Hybrid Sulfur Process could be a candidate for a DOE-supported thermochemical hydrogen pilot-plant program, scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2009.  Any company interested in participating in this research project must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than April 21, 2005, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the Hybrid Sulfur process.  Such information may require an executed nondisclosure agreement.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to Jack Simon, Savannah River National Laboratory, Aiken, SC, 29808, (803) 819-8420, or via email at jack.simon@srnl.doe.gov.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in collaborative research opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>S--Industrial Laundry Service - Fire Center
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) at the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 using Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to acquire Industrial Laundry Services for the National Fire Center Fire Equipment Warehouse, meeting all mandates and requirements under Fire Equipment Storage and Refurbishing Standards Handbook, dated December, 2003. The Government believes that the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency requirement is Cintas Corp, 2302 E. Railroad Street, Nampa, ID 83687-4940, who has deminstrated the ability to meet the critical needs and specifications of the standards requirements for mass volume of industrial laundry needing to be processed and returned as a time critical mandate, meeting market price determined to be fair and reasonable, with local facilities and proven response in meeting emergent needs of this agency.  The estimated value of this simplified acquisition is less than $50,000.00.  No Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be issued and no response will be made to letters or telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation. This is not a request for competitive quotes, as requirement NAR050014 was issued and cancelled, as a result of non-responsible responses. This special announcement serves as a procurement notice to fulfill public posting requirements in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1).  This requirement is unrestricted and the NAICS code 812332 and SIC code 7218 apply. Responsible firms believing they can provide the required items are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer referencing action item #RAQ052015.  However, they must provide supporting evidence they can furnish the requested services at a cost that will not exceed the total estimated transaction cost including R&D requirements, specialized rolling, vacuum extraction equipment with controlled heating, meeting sterilization mandates, and full technical certifications.  All responses will be fully considered. If no affirmative responses are received by March 30, 2005 to the effect that a comparable source exists, an order will be placed with Cintas Corp for the requirements stated here. Questions concerning this acquisition may be directed to Patrick Lorton at 208-387-5717 or faxed to 208-387-5574.

<SUBJECT>23 -- GH Trailer Rental
<DESC>The Government intends to award a follow-on contract for the rental/lease of a specially modified/configured mobile office trailer at Beale AFB, California as a direct award to Pacific Mobile Structures Inc.  This procurement is proceeding as a sole source award under FAR 13.106(b)(1).

 Pacific Mobile Structures Inc., a small business, is the contractor for the current rental/lease at Beale AFB. The trailer is currently being used to fulfill a sustained role to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing’s mission.  The current acquisition to continue the trailer rental/lease is a follow-on contract necessary to maintain continuity of services and mission integrity while avoiding duplication of costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The downtime and costs that would be incurred by competing the requirement such as preparing to remove, removing, storing, and reinstalling the equipment into another office trailer are deemed not acceptable for mission capability and integrity.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 321991.  The small business standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS LICENSEES FROM INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE LLNL’S MAGNETO-RADAR/FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL AND NON-METAL DETECTION, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more licensees to commercialize LLNL’S current patents and a newly allowed, soon to be published patent covering the Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal and non-metal detection, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods technology.

·	The Magneto-Radar is a completely new approach to a motion and range detection sensor for conductive materials whether metal or non metal.  

·	Materials may possibly be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve by detection at remote distances of very small vibrations such as from a turning fork induced in the targets. Ground balance problems are either eliminated or substantially reduced in most cases. 

·	Low-cost potential applications exist in treasure hunting equipment, medical, industrial, mining, security and safety screening, and analytical equipment.  

·	LLNL’s licensed field disturbance technology with range gating has been the basis for other products and other applications such as range controlled radar motion sensor for security application products selling commercially for under seventy dollars ($70) in the quantity of one.

·	MIR and field disturbance sensors provide range to object information while screening out clutter and discriminating from other signals due to the environment, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.

·	The MIR or field disturbance sensors can detect small vibrations, such as from a tuning fork, or steel guitar strings.

·	Varying frequencies and inter-modulation products of induced magnetic field targets may possibly provide more information to distinguish and identify them from other materials or movements.     

These technologies and methods relate to employing a portable, low-power, battery operated radar to sense and locate (range to object) even microscopic mechanically excited motion or vibration in objects such as but not limited to conductive and nonconductive bio-materials, including ferrous and non ferrous metals, wherein the mechanical vibration and resonance may be the result of mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, optical or electromagnetic excitation.  In many cases, the aforementioned materials can be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve. Ground balance problems are either substantially reduced by utilizing either the range gating and sensitive motion features of these technologies in combination or separately.



The MIR and field disturbance sensors are range-gated radars, which provide range to object information while screening out clutter, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.  The MIR and field disturbance sensor can be used in three capacities: (1) non-magneto, (2) magneto, or (3) contrast.  When used in the non-magneto capacity, the MIR and field disturbance sensor provides a substantially improved means of detecting stationary mechanically and/or acoustically (ex. for use in detection between walls in a building) induced vibrating and resonating objects and materials.  In the magneto capacity, the magnetically or electromagnetically induced vibration and resonance of an object can be detected via a characteristic double harmonic frequency.  Third, the radar can also detect the target object through microscopic movement resulting from changes in the size, image or contrast of the object.  

The Magneto-Radar using either LLNL’s MIR or the field disturbance sensor is a completely new approach to motion and range detection sensor technology using a bipolar generator, which generates unique double harmonics detectable by MIR or the field disturbance sensor.  The MIR and field disturbance sensors are a new low-cost implementation of a pulse echo radar.  Conventional radar pulses travel at the speed of light and require an oscilloscope for high speed sweeps in even nanoseconds, but LLNL's MIR and field disturbance sensor uses a time expansion technology known as equivalent time allowing it to sweep a million times slower or on a millisecond scale. This range-gated radar operates as a pulse echo system that clocks the two way time of flight of a very short electrical pulse.  It involves using a bipolar magnetic field to induce an eddy current in the target object generating a corresponding magnetic field (detectable phase shift relied upon by traditional metal detectors for determining various materials based on conductivity), transmitting various radar frequency signals to the conductive object, receiving reflected radar signals resulting from motion in the object, and processing the receive radar signals to produce an output signal that corresponds to a harmonic and/or an inter-modulation product of the resonating target object in the magnetic field.  The MIR radar transmits short, ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses and the receiver is designed to only receive signals from a preset range(s) R.  If there are no changes within or at range R, then the integrated return signal remains constant because stationary clutter signals are integrated as part of the constant return.  However, if anything penetrates the shell, it will change the reflectivity in range R, which causes a change in the detectable return signal attributed to motion.  Through doing this as well, the varying frequencies of the induced magnetic field targets can be more readily distinguished and identified from other materials or movements through harmonic analysis.  For example, when the magnetic excitation varies sinusoidally at a frequency F, the resulting resonance of the conductive object may occur at, but is not limited to 2F, providing a unique harmonic signature that is detected by the motion sensing MIR radar (ex. a bipolar excitation frequency of 60 Hz would result in a harmonic frequency of 120 Hz).     

Since the magnetic field of a traditional metal detector must travel out to the object and then couple back to the generator, a sixth order decrease in signal strength versus range results, forming a formidable limitation in range.  In fact, it is estimated that traditional metal detectors can only detect coins and jewelry at depths of only approximately 8 inches.  In the case of the Magneto-Radar, however, induction of the target and magnetic field emanating from the target object can be obtained via use of the coil of a traditional metal detector or via a more powerful custom magnetic field generator.  The strength of the induced magnetic field is usually directly proportional to the detection range.  Significantly increased magnetic field strength can be obtained by generating short duration, high peak power, pulsed magnetic fields, even with traditional metal detector coils, without overheating the coil because of the extremely short duty cycle of the MIR or the field disturbance sensor needed to recognize movement of the target.

<SUBJECT>A -- LLNL SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A SUB-MICROGRAM WEIGHING DEVICE BASED ON ION ENERGY LOSS
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE A 
SUB-MICROGRAM WEIGHING DEVICE BASED ON ION ENERGY LOSS

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's  Sub-micron Weighing Device by Ion Energy Loss technology.

Most biological laboratories use microgram balances for weighing small amounts of material, such as peptides and proteins. Microgram balances are sensitive to vibrations, humidity and static electric fields, and require frequent calibration. LLNL’s technology for weighing by ion energy loss eliminates these concerns and has been shown to be robust and routinely achieving a lower limit of quantitation better than 0.5 microgram.

The technology presents a significant improvement over existing sub-microgram balances in reliability and ease of use, and would appeal to analytical and biological laboratories anywhere routinely working with small amounts of precious material, such as in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries and university research laboratories. The weighing device can be made to mimic conventional balances for individual samples, or scaled up to a 96 or 384-well microtiter format for high-throughput applications. The components for the measurement apparatus are commercially available from several manufacturers and the disposable sample holders can be made from inexpensive plastics.

The technology is the subject of U.S. Patent 6,844,543 and pending patents. 
The weighing device consists of a dedicated alpha spectrometer, software and disposable plastic microcentrifuge tubes or microtiter plates carrying samples on an integrated thin polymer film. 

Two recent publications in the peer-reviewed journal Analytical Chemistry also describe the technology: ”Particle Energy Loss Measurement of Microgram Depositions of Biomolecules” [http://pubs.acs.org/cgibin/article.cgi/ancham/2003/75/i17/pdf/ac034170g.pdf]; and 

“Mass by Energy Loss Quantitation as a Practical Submicrogram Balance” [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/ancham/2005/77/i03/pdf/ac048560u.pdf].

Additional information on the technology and its potential applications can be obtained at the Mass by Ion Energy Loss Website.

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such technology to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our U.S. licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. The University of California’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory can license technology through exclusive or nonexclusive licensing agreements, as appropriate. All projects are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's sub-microgram balance based on ion energy loss should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.  Company Name and address.
2.  The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing
this technology.

<SUBJECT>A -- LLNL SEEKS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A 938nm FIBER LASER AND AMPLIFIER
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS 
TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A 938nm FIBER LASER AND AMPLIFIER

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license the technology for a High Power 938nm Fiber Laser and Amplifier.

LLNL has developed technology for a novel, high power 938nm fiber laser and amplifier.   The 938 nm optical fiber amplifier works in the 900nm to 950nm region of the wavelength spectrum.  The amplifier uses a neodymium doped, germanium co-doped silica glass fiber.   The laser is cladding pumped and is capable of high power output.   Researchers have demonstrated efficient operation of this device.  

The amplifier has the following features:
·	Scalable design capable of high power outputs;
·	Operates at room temperature;
·	Can amplify a narrow bandwidth without non-linear parasitic
interference;
·	Suppresses or eliminates parasitic amplified spontaneous emission at
1088 nm; 
·	Makes efficient use of pump power; and
·	Can be operated in continuous wave or pulsed temporal format.

LLNL researchers have also demonstrated sum frequency mixing schemes using periodically poled materials and different frequency fiber lasers.   This permits the design of higher power fiber laser systems with good reliability which can operate across a wide band of wavelengths.

LLNL’s fiber laser system offers advantages over competing solid-state laser designs.  Bulk solid state lasers require careful optical design to manage the thermal and beam aberrations expected in this type of laser, and such systems will probably require the maintenance services of a laser expert. Fiber lasers are self contained, turnkey units that require minimal maintenance from a non-laser expert.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's 938nm Fiber Laser and Amplifier should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:

1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

<SUBJECT>M--Sources Sought-Warehousing & Distribution Services At Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, CA (DDJC)
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is seeking an Expression of Interest (EOI) from prospective contractors or other concerned individuals or organizations who may be interested in participating in the A-76 Study for the installation support services at the Defense Distribution Depot San Joaquin, California (DDJC) guided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-76.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any other purpose.

The DLA is a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) agency that provides focused logistics support to America’s Armed Forces around the world.  DDJC is the DLA's western Strategic Distribution Platform with facilities at Tracy and Lathrop.  The two distribution facilities occupy over 1,600 acres and are located some 14 miles apart. The center is centrally located for easy access to complex interstates, waterways, and air and rail transportation networks.  DDJC’s mission is to receive, store, and ship government-owned supplies and equipment, primarily to military customers in the western US and the Pacific theater of operations, with additional worldwide capabilities.  As a Strategic Distribution Platform, DDJC serves as the west coast hub for distribution activities.  DDJC currently stores a wide range of supplies and equipment commonly ordered by the military services, including clothing and textiles, food, medical supplies, construction materials, electrical supplies/components, sonabouys, tires for both aircraft and vehicles, and a wide array of secondary repair parts.  DDJC also operates DLA's west coast's Consolidation and Containerization Point, consolidating overseas shipments from other defense distribution centers as well as from commercial vendors for all of the military services in the Pacific theater of operations.

The installation support services include: facilities and housing maintenance; operations and maintenance of utilities systems; operations and repair of HVAC and mechanical systems; material handling equipment (MHE), and vehicle maintenance; grounds maintenance and repair; refuse and miscellaneous services; and major accident and natural disaster response.  The service provider will be required to provide the leadership and management expertise necessary and appropriate to manage and to accomplish all functions contained in the Performance Work Statement (PWS).  The annual baseline cost is approximately $ 7.6 million.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-05-R-SE04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-01 and DFARS Change Notice 20050222. The NAICS code is 334413 and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for semiconductors, which will be a component of a railgun energy storage bank. NRL will supply the labor and minor components to assemble the complete energy storage bank. This requirement shall consist of: (1) thyristors; (2) diodes; (3)trigger system; and (4) snubber system.  Thyristors shall handle (1) a peak current in excess of 100 kA (kiloamperes), single pulse duty, less than 5 milliseconds pulse length; (2)  single pulse action in excess of 3E7 (30,000,000)A-A-sec (ampere-squared-sec); (3) DC holdoff voltage in excess of 11kV;  (4) current risetime capacity of at least 150 A/microsecond and (5) lifetime at rated current and action in excess of 10,000 pulses.  Thyristors shall be stacked in series, not parallel in order to meet the above specifications.  It is anticipated that a quantity of 12 thyristors sets shall be required. Diodes shall handle: (1) peak current in excess of 140kA (kiloamperes), single pulse duty, less than a5 milliseconds pulse length; (2) single pulse action in excess of 2.5E7 (25,000,000) A-A-sec (ampere-squared-sec); (3)  DC holdoff voltage in excess of 11kV; (4) current risetime capacity of at least 400 A/microsecond; and (5) lifetime at rated current and action in excess of 10,000 pulses.

It is anticipated that a quantity of 12 sets of components are required to simultaneously trigger the stack of the thyristors. The snubber system shall be light duty to assure balanced voltage division across thyristor stack. Snubbers shall be R-C filter in parallel with the thyristors that assure the division of the 11kV voltage across the devices so that each thyristor only needs to hold off its fair share of the voltage. The snubber shall also absorb the energy spike associated with the thyristor ceasing to carry current.  It is anticipated that a snubber will be required for each individual thyristor, in the 12 thyristor sets. If 5 thyristors are required in a set, then a total of 60 snubber would be required.
