<DESC>This announcement is amended to correct the closing date of the solicitation from January 15, 2014 to January 30, 2014. Additionally, the Government has incorporated the called out changes to the specification as an appendix to the Statement of Work, Exhibit A of the solicitation package. <br>  <br> The purpose of this announcement is to advertise solicitation SPRBL1-14-R-0009. The anticipated release date of this solicitation is on or about 16 December 2013 with a closing date of January 30, 2014.  <br>    <br>  This solicitation is being issued as a 100% small business set-aside  <br>    <br>  This synopsis is for a 3 year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract with one base year and two option years for the following item, NSN 6130-01-522-3494 or in accordance with a performance specification provided by the Government.   The total length of the contract is not to exceed three years.  The Government intends to award multiple contracts from this solicitation but reserves the right to award one contract to a single offeror, if it is determined by the Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the Government.  <br>    <br>    <br>  It should be noted that this is an interim contract needed to satisfy current demand until an updated version of the power supply is awarded.   <br>    <br>  Item: Power Supply  <br>    <br>  Federal Supply Class: 6130  <br>    <br>  Part Number Assigned by the Government: PP-2953D/U  <br>    <br>  Best Estimated Quantity: It is anticipated that the yearly estimated quantity for the resulting contract is approximately 1,350 units per year. Please note that this is an estimate and should be used for planning purposes only. The Government is only obligated to order the guaranteed minimum, which will be included in the forthcoming solicitation. Additionally, as noted above, this is an interim contract needed to satisfy current demand until an updated version of the power supply is awarded; therefore, the Government cannot guarantee that the contract options will be exercised.  <br>    <br>  Performance Specifications: MIL-PRF-49080 Revision B is the basic performance specification. In addition to the basic performance specification, the Government will include changes to this specification, which are included as an appendix to the Statement of Work, Exhibit A. The official solicitation package, once released, will include a finalized requirement to include the approved changes. The basic performance specification (Revision B) is available at http://quicksearch.dla.mil/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=26824&method=basic  <br>    <br>  Function of the Item: The power supply furnishes 0-25 amperes over a voltage range of 24 to 32VDC from nominal 115/230 VAC at 50, 60 or 400 Hz single phase. The power supply can also operate from a 24 VDC storage battery in the battery standby mode  <br>    <br>  The evaluation approach to be used in this acquisition is a two-step approach.  (1) All offerors must first demonstrate that they can meet the technical qualifications on an acceptable/unacceptable basis.  (2) Acceptable contractors will then be evaluated using a trade-off of factors such as past performance, price, and delivery.  While price is a significant factor, the Government will select for award, the offeror(s) who represent the best value to the Government at the determination of the Contracting Officer based on the trade-off criteria as listed in the solicitation.  <br>    <br>  Please monitor this announcement for updates and changes. Questions and comments can be addressed to the contract specialist, Eric Snow, at eric.m.snow.civ@mail.mil or 443-861-4532.  <br>  <br>
