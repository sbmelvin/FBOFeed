<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for the ECSS program to gather information about the market capabilities to provide ERP services in support of a possible transition from a contracted systems integrator structure to an Air Force-led system integrator role. ECSS is the major information technology platform, enabling the overall USAF vision of total logistics transformation, eLog21.The ECSS program office is possibly transitioning from a contracted Systems Integrator (SI) to an Air Force-led implementer.  In this capacity the Air Force would take a more active role in all the activities that are accomplished by a systems integrator in order to develop and deliver the ECSS solution.  The focus of initial future releases has shifted to financial compliance as it relates to the Air Force's logistics systems.  Capabilities to be developed and deployed in the next three years include core financials and wholesale and retail supply.

<DESC>The information below contains general responses to questions received from industry regarding the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Network Enabled Weather (NNEW) - Request for Information (RFI). The RFI was originally posted on August 16, 2011.
Should you have any questions regarding the subject matter, please contact Kathy St. Hill at 202-385-6136 or kathy.sthill@faa.gov. 
=====================================================
General Response to Vendor Questions: 


Sections 1 and 2: 
The NNEW introduction and scope will be written to align with the acquisition approach. The comments will be considered when revising the final draft.   


Section 3.1.1: Discovery requirement comments 
 The requirements for discovery of weather services will be specified separately from discovery of weather data.  Inexact keyword searching supports the discovery of weather products and services without matching the exact keyword used in the search criteria.  Requirements for design time and runtime discovery will be listed separately.   

Section 3.1.2: Data Management Requirement comments 
 Answers to questions dealing with data forwarded to the NOAA 4-D Weather Data Cube and the details about the SAS are not finalized at this time.  The team concurs with the comments regarding the minimum and maximum ranges for specific requirements. These ranges will be included in the system specification, as applicable.  Comments referring to specific legacy system interfaces will be addressed in the Interface Requirements Documents, as applicable.  Machine-to-machine or interactive user interface comments: The NNEW System will require a user interface to support system administration and maintenance. The NNEW System supports the dissemination of weather products and services including tailored weather data via pub/sub and request/reply mechanisms.   

Section 3.1.3: Service Management Requirement comments 
The FAA SWIM/FTI infrastructure implements and governs many of the service monitoring and performance mechanisms addressed in the requirements. The vendor must support the appropriate monitoring and reporting mechanisms in this environment. The allocation of requirements for the NNEW contractor-developed system will be included in the NNEW System Specification.   

Section 3.1.4: Security Management Requirement comments 
The FAA SWIM/FTI infrastructure will implement and govern many of the security and boundary protection mechanisms addressed in the requirements. The vendor must support the appropriate security mechanisms in this environment. The allocation of requirements for the NNEW contractor-developed system will be included in the NNEW System Specification. 


Section 3.1.5: Messaging Management Requirement comments 
Machine-to-machine or interactive user interface comments: The NNEW System supports the dissemination of weather products and services including tailored weather data via pub/sub and request/reply mechanisms. 


Section 3.2: Performance Requirement comments 
The NNEW performance requirements will be fully defined in the NNEW System Specification. 


Section 4:  Physical Integration Requirement comments 
The physical integration requirements will be specified in the NNEW System Specification and SOW, as applicable. 

Section 5:  Functional Integration Requirement comments 
 The product characteristics will be provided in the procurement package.  Airborne consumer requirements are under investigation. Requirements will be included in the NNEW System Specification, if applicable. The NNEW System will not communicate directly with aircraft.  The Interface Requirements Documents (IRD) will be available as part of the solicitation package as applicable. Interface Control Documents (ICD) will be developed by the contractor, as appropriate.  The complete list of system interfaces will be provided in the NNEW System Specification. 


Section 6:  Human Integration 
The Human Integration requirements identified in Section 6.0 that are levied on the Contractor will be included in the NNEW System Specification or the SOW. 


Section 8:  In-Service Support

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing Request for Proposal (RFP) DU205NC-12-R-0002 in support of the Office of Policy Development and Research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The demonstration will test alternatives to the current rent structure in the Housing Choice Voucher Program using a random assignment experimental model.&nbsp; Rent reform may impact assisted housing residents in terms of the rents they pay, the amounts they save and earn, as well as the income stream to the Housing Agency that administers the housing subsidy.&nbsp; The demonstration would mostly likely be undertaken at select Moving to Work (MTW) sites, because MTW Public Housing Agencies already have a legislative authority to request waivers from the 1937 Housing Act.&nbsp; While a goal of the current study is to increase earnings, that goal may be achieved through more complete reporting of income and higher wages.&nbsp; Because the intervention is not directly focused on employment, the impact of work effort may be relatively small.&nbsp; Additionally, a reasonable goal of rent reform is to reduce under-reporting of income which would have the effect of increasing reported earnings.&nbsp; The work requirements will be set out in the Statement of Work within the RFP.&nbsp;&nbsp;Services to be furnished under the resulting contract shall be ordered by issuance of a task order.&nbsp; Such order(s) may be issued from effective date of contract through sixty (60) months thereafter.&nbsp; North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 541720.&nbsp; Solicitation will be available on or about December 21, 2011.&nbsp; Proposals will be due on or about January 20, 2012.&nbsp; Please submit questions to Pat Leseman at <a href="mailto:pat.leseman@hud.gov">pat.leseman@hud.gov</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

The contract will consist of one 12-month base ordering period followed by four 12-month optional ordering periods and an option to extend services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8. The base period and all option periods will be evaluated prior to award.<br /><br />The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561612, Security Guard and Patrol Services. The size standard is $18.5 million. The RFQ shall require the submission of a technical quotation as well as a price quotation. It is anticipated that the solicitation, RFQ# HSHQE4-11-R-0002, will be released to the Federal Business Opportunities website on or about December 7, 2011.

All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (http://www.ccr.gov). Further, quoters are required to go online to the Business Partner Network (http://orca.bpn.gov) to complete their Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) prior to submittal of a quotation.

Per HSAM 3005.207: The FedBizOpps staff is not authorized to determine the classification code for any FedBizOpps notice. Because a misclassified contract action fails to notify the firms most likely to respond and therefore may violate the Competition in Contracting Act, the Contracting Officer is held responsible for correctly classifying any FedBizOpps notice. A misclassified contract action must be corrected and re-synopsized in FedBizOpps. Detailed classification codes are available on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov/.<br />

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The ASG software acquired and maintained through this contract action will support all equipment augmentations and all government owned software-processing environments both mainframe and distributed. Only ASG, the OEM, will satisfy the agency's requirements because brand name products are required and ASG is highly specialized in providing the software maintenance required to meet the needs of DISA. At this time, it is known that only ASG products will function with the current ASG products deployed at DISA facilities and there are no known competitor functional equivalents.<br /><br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Justification&nbsp;is attached. </span>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this RFI market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.  <br><br><br>DISCLAIMER: This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein. If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published.<br><br><br>PURPOSE: The Office of Federal Procurement Policy has been encouraging government contracting officers to communicate better with industry before and after contract awards to better understand what is available and how it should be contracted.<br>A central tenet of acquisition reform is to significantly improve the quality of market research. One of the main benefits of solid market research is to materially improve the Government's understanding of the current state of the marketplace, including commercial/Government best practices, industry capabilities, innovative delivery approaches, commercial market service levels, performance strategies and measures. For this upcoming requirement, a special emphasis of the market research is being placed on performance metrics and measurements, innovative delivery methods for the required services, and incentive programs that your firm may have found particularly effective.  The Government is also interested in identifying performance criteria that differentiates between and among high quality firms in this field. We believe this information will dramatically improve the quality of the forthcoming acquisition, inclusive of the solicitation and resulting contract.  <br><br>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The proposed contract shall provide Performance Based Logistic (PBL) driven support and management services for the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical Increment 1 (WIN-T Inc 1) systems, component parts, and test sets, located worldwide. This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to increase efficiencies and effectiveness of the sustainment phase of the life cycle for WIN-T Systems Inc 1 through the application of performance base logistics (PBL).  Based on responses to this RFI, it is anticipated a future solicitation will be procured through full and open competition with an estimated contract award date of First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013.  <br>Note:  RFI responses will NOT be shared with other industry suppliers and will solely be used as part of the contract planning process.<br><br><br>BACKGROUND:  The WIN-T Inc 1 program is a state-of the-art Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS)/Government Off The Shelf (GOTS) communications network that enables the exchange of voice, video, and data throughout tactical Army units and into the sustaining base. WIN-T Inc 1 is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) 1D weapon system of systems initially fielded as the Joint Network Node-Network (JNN-N) to meet requirements specified in the Bridge to Future Networks (BFN) Capabilities Production Document (CPD). To meet BFN CPD requirements, the JNN-N was acquired as an emergency communications upgrade to augment Current Force tactical communications network capabilities with the application of COTS technology.  The JNN-N program was reorganized under the WIN-T program as part of the 5 June 2007 Nunn-McCurdy certification of the WIN-T program as WIN-T Inc 1. WIN-T Inc 1 is currently being procured under the Lot 10 production contract (W15P7T-07-D-K001).  It leverages commercial satellite technology to provide beyond line of sight capabilities and commercial internet networking technology to increase functionality and efficiency while reducing size, weight and power.  WIN-T Inc 1 components reside at the Theater, Corps, Division, Brigade and Battalion levels and provide interfaces to lower level systems including on the move and soldier platforms. The WIN-T Inc 1 system includes but is not limited to the following end items (nodes):<br><br>a)	AN/TSC-167F(V)1,2  	JNN SATCOM Transportable Terminal (STT)<br>b)	AN/TSC-185(V)1,2   	JNN SATCOM Transportable Terminal (STT)<br>c)	AN/TSC-169B        	Unit Hub SATCOM Truck (UHST)<br>d)	AN/TSC-187         		Unit Hub SATCOM Truck (UHST)<br>e)	AN/FSC-141         		Regional HUB Node (RHN) Antenna<br>f)	OA-9517/T          		Master Reference Terminal (MRT)<br>g)	OA-9523/T          		Master Reference Terminal (MRT)<br>h)	AN/TTC-56(v)3, 4   	Single Shelter Switch (SSS)<br>i)	AN/TTC-56A(v)3, 4  	Single Shelter Switch (SSS)<br>j)	AN/TTC-59(V)4,5,6  	Joint Network Node (JNN)<br>k)	AN/TTC-59A(v)3,5,6 	Joint Network Node (JNN)<br>l)	AN/TTC-61(V)3      	Tactical Hub (TAC HUB)<br>m)	AN/TTC-61A(V)2,3   	Tactical Hub (TAC HUB)<br>n)	AN/FSC-133(V)1-5   	Regional Hub Node (RHN)<br>o)	AN/TTC-64(V)2,3    	Battalion Command Post Node (BnCP)<br>p)	OM-87A&B           		Battalion Command Post Node (BnCP)<br>q)	OL-761(V)1-7T      		Network Operations (NetOps)<br>r)	OL-783(V)1-4       		Tactical NetOps Management System (TNMS)<br>	<br>The approved Army Procurement Objective (APO) requiring support is 216 units (residing at the aforementioned echelons) and 1,860 nodes which comprise the above list of nomenclatures.<br><br>OBJECTIVE:  WIN-T Inc 1 is currently supported through Interim Contractor Logistics Support (ICS) by a two level maintenance concept that includes field and depot level maintenance.  This office intends to transition from the current ICS sustainment strategy to a PBL Support Strategy (SS). The WIN-T Inc 1 PBL SS requires performance-based support for those elements listed under scope and provides the best value to the Army. The overarching objective is to reduce total ownership cost without degrading current system readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas. <br><br>The PBL team will consist of a Product Support Integrator (PSI) and multiple Product Support Providers (PSPs). The PBL sustainment contract will support a Product Support Strategy (PSS) structure that utilizes PBL with the Logistics & Readiness Center (LRC) as the PSI.  The PSI office will be the single point of accountability and touchstone for PM WIN-T throughout the remaining lifecycle of WIN-T Inc 1. This office plans to seek a primary Product Support Provider for the elements of sustainment listed under scope. The PSP will serve as the single point of accountability for those elements listed, accountable to the PSI and PM. <br><br><br>SCOPE: <br>The anticipated PBL contract will support the following LRC and PM WIN-T sustainment requirements/elements:(1) Program Management of the contract, Engineering and Test Support; (2) Field Service Support;(3) Modification Work Orders (MWO) Development and Implementation;(4) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS);(5) Supply Chain Management of CECOM managed spare parts; (6) Packaging, Handling, Shipping and Transportation (PHS&T);  (7) Reset and Depot Level Overhaul; and (8)  all versions of Inc 1/JNN equipment (Spiral 1 to Lot 14) including the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) equipment for the aforementioned end items listed above.  It is further noted that the PBL approach may utilize public-private partnership (PPP) agreements in accordance with the Inc 1 Core Logistics Analysis (CLA) as long as a single point of accountability for all objectives is identified.<br><br>The most effective and efficient PBL approach must comply with the Army's Two Level Maintenance Policy, Core Logistics Statute, US Code, Title 10, Section 2464,  and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) objectives of Planning, Fielding Execution, Deployment Support, Support while Deployed, and Reset capabilities for both war and peace time arenas.  <br><br>Engineering services support includes the hardware (HW) and software (SW) support needed to maintain the WIN-T Inc 1 fielded baseline as well as implementing WIN-T Increment 1 system changes and updates due to evolving requirements.  The PSP will be required to insert new technologies, components, and/or configuration items into the WIN-T Inc 1 system as specified by the Government under separate Engineering Change Proposals (ECP) and/or contract modifications.  Additionally, technical assistance will be needed in implementing cyclical technology refreshment for End of Life/obsolete items.<br><br>The PSP will be required to provide modification services performed in either the contractor's facilities or at Government-provided sites.  The Government will make available test-bed assets for use in the contractor's facilities or at a Government-provided site as required to support the software and system integration test activities. Services will include reconfiguration of system or equipment, updates of systems to satisfy new deployment requirements and implementation of Modification Work Orders (MWO).<br><br>For all software integration work implemented, the PSP will be required to perform software testing, to include Software Integration and Testing (SI&T) and Government-witnessed testing.  The PSP will deliver test related documentation such as test procedures and reports, and software version description documentation.  The PSP will also provide documentation and support to allow for the transition and sustainment of the new integrated software products to the CECOM Software Engineering Center performing Post Production Software Support (PPSS).<br><br>The PSP shall be capable of providing field service support.  Contractor Field Service Representatives (CFSRs) shall be required at CONUS and OCONUS locations and required to provide training, technical manual preparation and updates, network planning and management, system software (SW) and firmware (FW) installation/updates, maintenance screeners and troubleshooters, repair and maintenance turn-in points.<br><br>The supply chain strategy must be seamless to the Soldier, completely interface with the Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) via Electronic Data Interchange (EDI),  and use the Army Standard Supply System (e.g. process and fill requisitions) for WIN-T Inc 1 parts that are coded as Source of Supply (SOS) B16 (CECOM).  The goal for the WIN-T PBL supply chain is 95% stock availability. Stock availability is defined as the number of requisitions delivered to CONUS and OCONUS sites within the Customer Wait Times (CWT) listed below:<br> Wartime CWT None > 3 Days; Peacetime CWT None >7 Days<br><br>All assets to support the supply chain are considered Government Owned, Contractor Maintained.  B16 stock must be maintained to the latest configuration and the contractor must adjust Government stock levels in Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) via a Government approved interface. Government stock levels must be maintained via procurement or repair from the applicable Source of Repair (SOR)/Source of Supply (SOS).  For repairable items, the PSP will accept, inventory, and coordinate the repair/replacement of unserviceable assets received from the Inventory Control Point (ICP) and will utilize these assets as part of the available pool of stock to fill requisitions.  For planning purposes, utilize a 75% Unserviceable return rate (UNRR) on applicable items. The PSP will require Government approval prior to taking disposal actions.<br><br>The current ICS support strategy utilizes commercial world wide support centers to supplement organic forward support as a means of achieving the stock availability and CWT goals for WIN-T Inc 1 equipment. If an alternative solution is proposed, the vendor must provide a detailed overview of the strategy and an implementation plan. If the proposed sustainment strategy utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required for how these organizations will be used in response to this RFI.  All items included in this RFI are CECOM managed items.  However, WIN-T Inc 1 uses DLA managed items as piece parts for the repair of Depot Level Repairables (DLRs).  The procurement of these piece parts must comply with the Army Materiel Command (AMC) Memorandum, "Order of Preference for Utilizing Repair Parts from Various Source of Supply (SOS)", available upon request.<br>  <br><br>RESPONSES:   All submissions should be in Microsoft Word for Office 2003 or a compatible format.  The Government intends to use various military and civilian Army personnel in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement.  The Army contracts with each company include the appropriate organizational conflict of interest and nondisclosure agreements.  Proprietary information WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.<br>A.	The government will evaluate responses to this RFI to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules, cost containment, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract. <br><br><br>B.

<SUBJECT>Pilot Test for EDI Transactions of Standards Adopted Under HIPAA
<SOLNBR>HHS-CMS-DBSC-SS-11-126
<RESPDATE>010612
<CONTACT>Jennifer L. Hennessy, Contract Specialist, Phone 4107862460, Email jennifer.hennessy@cms.hhs.gov
<DESC><strong>PILOT TEST FOR EDI TRANSACTIONS OF STANDARDS ADOPTED UNDER HIPAA<br /><br /></strong>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses that can provide development and implementation of a pilot to test transaction standards that have been or may be recommended for adoption to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), for mandatory use by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).<br /><br /><strong>1.0 Background<br /><br /></strong>The original HIPAA legislation required the adoption of an initial set of standards for administrative and financial transactions between health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers. The transactions were for eligibility for a health plan, claims, claim payment, claim status, authorizations and referrals, enrollment in a health plan, and premium billing. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires adoption of additional and/or updated standards, as well as operating rules to support all adopted standard transactions.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Existing process for the adoption of standards (new or updated)<br /><br /></span></strong>1. Work groups within the Standards Development Organization (SDO) create or revise the implementation specification for each transaction in accordance with a regular schedule. Each updated version is voted on by various levels of work groups. Membership in the SDO is required for a vote, but each organization only gets one vote. <br />2. Updated and approved versions of the transaction standards are presented by the SDO to the Designated Standards Maintenance Organization (DSMO). The DSMO was named in the original HIPAA legislation in 2001, and is comprised of three SDOs and the code content committees. <br />3. The DSMO takes the updated and approved versions of the standards to the National Committee on Vital Health Statistics (NCVHS), suggesting that they recommend adoption. The NCVHS conducts industry hearings, presumably to obtain industry input on the new versions, and in turns makes a recommendation to the Secretary to adopt a standard or updated version of a standard.<br />4. The Secretary then publishes proposed and final rules to adopt the standard. Industry has two years in which to comply with the standard after publication of the final rule. For details on the adoption of the current set of transaction standards, visit the Regulations and Guidance page on the CMS website at www.cms.gov.
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History of standards adoption under HIPAA<br /><br /></span></strong>The regulations adopting the ASC X12 and NCPDP standards were first promulgated in 2001; the first compliance date was October 2003. The adopted versions were ASC X12 Version 4010 and NCPDP 5.1. In January 2009, HHS adopted updated versions of the two standards - ASC X12 Version 5010 and NCPDP D.0. Compliance is required by January 2012.. While both versions of the standards were adopted based on recommendations from the DSMO to NCVHS, and NCVHS to the Secretary, neither version was subjected to vigorous industry testing prior to adoption, and there were substantive implementation issues for X12 Version 4010, causing the need for addenda, followed by other issues for X12 Version 5010, which also resulted in addenda for several of the transactions. The need for the Version 5010 addenda is sometimes cited as responsible, in part, for the industry's delayed testing and implementation in the fall of 2011, necessitating another enforcement discretion policy for compliance with the standards. . In sum, HHS has adopted two versions of the X12 standards without any prior testing or validation; costing the private and public sector significant dollars. Again, in both cases, problems were identified with the transaction standards after they had been balloted by the SDO, recommended to the DSMO, to NCVHS, and then to the Secretary. These problems necessitated errata, addenda, a federal register notice outlining the problems and adopting a new sub version of the standard (4010A1), and most recently, the imposition of "enforcement discretion" for Version 5010 as a result of various technical issues identified late in the testing process. <br /><br />Within the next few years, HHS must adopt two new standards - one for electronic funds transfer (EFT) and one for electronic claims attachments. The EFT standard has been created by the financial services sector, and is maintained by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA). Interestingly, there has been little controversy with this standard in its current use across all industry sectors; but it has not yet been in wide spread or consistent use in the health care industry. The other new standard is for electronic claims attachments. <br /><br />Before any recommendations for adoption of new standards or new versions of transaction standards, there should be a formal process for piloting and/or testing them for usability and usefulness to industry. For example, if the SDO and/or DSMO intend to propose adoption of a new version of the X12 standard, e.g. Version 6020, there must be data available to prove that this version is viable and acceptable to industry prior to adoption. <br /><br /><strong>2.0 Requirements Overview and Operations<br /><br /></strong>The following provides potential responders with an overview of the types of support that would be required of the Pilot Test of Standards contractor. Note that although this is an extensive list, it is not meant to be all inclusive. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Scope<br /><br /></span></strong>The purpose of this project is to develop and execute a method of testing the updated versions of ASC X12 standard transactions before they are adopted under HIPAA and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Background<br /></span>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), is anticipating re-competing a full and open competition contract for support for interdisciplinary studies. A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Occupational and environmental investigations play an important role in this effort because well-documented, high-level exposures to potential carcinogens occur in the workplace and because environmental exposures can impact a large segment of the population. <br /><br />The fundamental mission of the OEEB is to identify and clarify causes of cancer, with a focus on occupational and environmental exposures. To achieve its goals, OEEB's approach has been to (1) merge epidemiology, quantitative exposure assessment, and biologic and genetic components into multi-disciplinary investigations to identify carcinogens, clarify exposure-response relationships, and enhance our mechanistic understanding of carcinogenesis; (2) conduct investigations to develop and improve methods for exposure assessment and to evaluate and incorporate state-of-the-art biomarker assays into its molecular epidemiology studies; (3) facilitate the development of consortia to efficiently create scientific opportunities that are difficult to achieve in any one study; (4) develop and maintain resources for occupational and environmental epidemiology and exposure assessment; and (5) assist in training the next generation of occupational, environmental, and molecular epidemiologists.<br /><br />The philosophic focus of OEEB is to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action. Approximately twenty-five studies will likely receive support under the contract.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200700044C held by Westat, Inc. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirement<br /></span>This support services contract is essential for OEEB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate quantitative exposure assessment and molecular epidemiology to provide new insights into cancer etiology, chemical carcinogenesis, and mechanisms of action.

1.	Introduction   
1.1.	 RFI Purpose
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration's (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA), Human Factors Office (HFO) is seeking information, for market survey purposes, on digital pen and paper technology, and the level of effort needed to establish an assessment of the capabilities. The focus of the evaluation will be on the technology itself, NOT of vendor brand.  
1.2.	 POC Background
The HFO, previously known as Emerging Health Technology (EHT), began its Point of Care (POC) Information Technology Assessment Initiative in 2009. Our scope is information technology (IT) devices and it does not include biomedical devices. This digital pen and paper RFI and potential user experience (UX) investigation is part of a larger effort to identify, evaluate, and disseminate information within VHA about clinical POC information technologies. Our team is identifying and assessing newer and emerging information technologies as candidates for improving the quality and efficiency of healthcare to the Veteran. To this end, HFO collaborates with VHA front-line providers and gathers their perceptions of technologies with regard to usability of the devices and utility in workflow. Example IT devices include netbooks, tablet PCs and hand-held mobile solutions with an associated secure interface to VA's Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). 
1.3.	RFI Goals
HFO desires to gain knowledge of digital pen and paper technology with capabilities of digitally capturing handwritten notes and graphics.  We believe there to be potential value in the ability to integrate the usage of this technology with clinical data collection processes for CPRS, the VA's Electronic Health Record. For example, using a digital pen and paper as a means to document notes while working with a patient, capture drawings and diagrams, enter information on pre-printed forms, and have all the data incorporated into CPRS. HFO intends to assess the utility and usability of this technology with regard to patient care and clinical workflow. HFO seeks information about available digital pen and paper devices, as well as support services for using the devices in healthcare settings.    
Specifically, HFO seeks the following information through this RFI: 
1.3.1.	 How VHA could technically set-up digital pen and paper to support a meaningful evaluation of clinician data input;
1.3.2.	 Vendor willingness to provide the VHA ten (10) digital pens and means to create digital paper for up to ninety (90) days at no charge for evaluation purposes.  Note: The products will be used in a secure, lab-type environment for evaluating the technology's utility and usability.  No destructive testing will occur. VHA will return the products to the vendor upon completion of the investigation; 
1.3.3.	 Vendor willingness to provide a user's guide, operating manual or access to other technical resources that will aid in proper use of the equipment; and
1.3.4.	"How VHA could conceptually integrate digital pen and paper with a test CPRS database for the purpose of clinician data input".


1.4.	 RFI Process 
HFO will manage this RFI process.  
This RFI will NOT be used as an acquisition vehicle. HFO may use the information provided to develop a competitive procurement document at a future date, which will best reflect the marketplace for these products and/or services.   
After review of the RFI responses and assessment of the marketplace, HFO may or may not choose to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for device acquisition and/or these services.  
Participation in the RFI process will not be a mandatory requirement for any subsequent competitive procurement, although the results of this RFI may be used to build and refine an RFP.  
HFO, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to refrain from issuing an RFP or any other formal solicitation document for these services.  

2.	Vendor Response Outline

II. Background: 
Business Architecture Service (BA) is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Health Information (OHI), Enterprise Systems Management (ESM).  BAs mission is to enable the building of technology through foundational support of VHA mission, vision, and goals by providing comprehensive architectural representation.  

VHA OHI/ESM supports and executes VHAs vision and mission to Honor Americas veterans as heroes by providing the highest quality health care by defining the business requirements and direction of VAs award-winning electronic healthcare system, Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA).  BAs vision is to provide a coherent BA Health Business Architecture representation that serves as a collaborative foundation for VHAs transformational IT implementation.  

BA works collaboratively with other ESM and OHI components, and VHA Program Offices to develop, implement and monitor comprehensive healthcare business functions and related Information Technology (IT) solutions.  BA serves to unite VHA clinical/business owners and VAs Office of Information and Technology (OIT) and represents the foundational health segment architecture of the VHAs electronic health record.  BA promotes customer engagement throughout the IT Systems lifecycle, provides coordination to ensure that VHA business process and requirements are reflected in the health IT system products, and advises and aligns strategy with the VHA IT portfolios.  
In order to meet Presidential Agenda objectives, VHA needs to work toward implementing Service Oriented Architecture, interagency collaboration toward a joint electronic health record and a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record.  VHA also needs a repository which can organize and link all architectural artifacts for maximum ability and efficiency of information sharing.

1.0 	BACKGROUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Freight Transportation Program (VAFTP) manages and reports on the delivery, timeliness, and costs to transport goods throughout the national VA infrastructure.  The database applications (General Freight and Operation New Hope Application) for both the freight program and VA's Homeless Veterans Clothing Distribution Program require periodic upgrading, modifications, additional reporting capabilities, systems support, and repairs.  The application resides on a server currently located within the VA Central Office (VACO) network Washington, DC operations facility and is also accessed from remote locations in Chicago, IL and Hillsborough, NJ. Access to these applications is for 14 hours daily.

The VAFTP is functionally divided into two primary functions: (1) freight management and warehousing operations control, and (2) administrative support for network and client systems and database Maintenance.

The VAFTP users are VA transportation and warehousing professionals responsible for the timely and cost-effective transport of goods throughout the VA infrastructure and to other government agencies. Business functions associated with the Program include, but are not limited to:

"	Shipping and delivering goods employing Transportation Service Providers (TSPs). 
"	Tracking freight, booking ocean cargo, obtaining air transport, and negotiating/selecting "best value" carrier rates.  
"	Preparation of warehouse inventories and bills of lading and ocean shipment manifests.
"	Routing and monitoring shipments.
"	Uploading and managing freight rates.
"	Preparation of shipping documents and performing freight bill audits. 
"	Report generation, estimating freight charges.   


VAFTP Business Functions 

"	The receipt and upload of customer transportation service requests and notification of shipment status to customers.
"	Submission of electronic shipping requests, generation of reports on shipment records, creation of freight estimates, access to mileage information, access to truckload, ocean  and less-than-truckload freight rates.
"	Electronic submission of bills of lading to TSPs, customers, contractors, and electronic submission of rate quotation requests to TSPs.
"	Ability to search for and identify user's shipment requests, ensuring all shipment requests are sent to the central operations center and all bills of lading issued show the amount approved for payment during prepayment audit.
"	Tracking and maintaining warehouse receipts, inventories, and shipments, with emphasis on "odd-lot" controls due to differing original-pack units.
"	Preparation of ad-hoc reports in addition to standard reports for shipment manifests, current inventories, bills of lading, and rate quotation requests for distribution to selected users. 
"	Monitoring, deactivating, and notifying selected users when modifying rate files based on business rules; performing archiving functions.
"	Maintenance of archived shipment records, bills of lading, inventory records, and rates for 6 years prior to purging electronic files.

The application's present use is limited to VA's centralized transportation centers in Washington DC, Hillsborough, NJ, and Hines, IL, which covers transportation requests for the entire VA infrastructure and to other government agencies.

<DESC>Information Technology Enterprise Managed Services (ITEMS) - Managed Data Center Services - Pilot (MDCS-P)
<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking to change how the Agency procures and provisions Information Technology (IT) in order to meet expanding mission requirements given budgetary constraints. Labor vs. performance-based contracts and IT governance issues are driving up Operations &amp; Sustainment (O&amp;S) costs. Currently, there are multiple IT acquisition vehicles across the agency. NGA wishes to implement a managed services model that decreases complexity, increases agility, enhances reliability, while improving efficiency and effectiveness of IT delivery in support of the Agency's mission. The goal is to have one consolidated Infrastructure Service Provider (ISP) strategy across NGA using the appropriate (best fit) Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) best practices.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for industry to assist in further refining the NGA's Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Managed Data Center Services Pilot (MDCS-P) prior to its release. The intent is for industry to provide comments and suggestions on the artifacts to improve them and ensure that NGA can clearly and unambiguously articulate their objectives in the release of the final MDCS-P RFP.</p>
<p>The RFI is posted on the CLASSIFIED Intelligence Community Acquisition Research Center (IC-ARC) Website. For information on how to access to the CLASSIFIED IC-ARC, go to arc.westfields.net. IC-ARC contact numbers are 703-961-6957, 703-961-6955 or 703-488-5154.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Mission Support Division, Norfolk, VA is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Rapp Hydema US, Inc for the spooling of 6000 meters of trawl winch wire rope aboard the NOAA Ship Pisces. This trawl winch system was designed and built by Rapp Hydema US. The period of performance shall start on or about March 1, 2012 in accordance with the ship's schedule and shall take five (5) days to complete. Work shall be preformed at the NOAA Gulf Marine Support Facility, 151 Watts Avenue, Pascagoula, MS 39567. The statutory authority is 41 US 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. Rapp Hydema has provided/installed a multi-million dollar trawl and scientific winch, hydraulic power, and hydraulic control system on board the NOAA Ship Pisces. The components of the systems are proprietary and require use of Rapp Hydema technicians and engineers to ensure work is performed in accordance with manufacturer's proprietary technical specifications and guarantee safety, reliability, and prevent inadvertent damage. No other entity can provide the necessary repairs required as required by a Rapp Hydema certified technician. Rapp Hydema does not have a factory certification or authorized dealership network from which various vendors/dealers can be solicited. Any warranty or performance issues with this system would put the Government at a severe disadvantage if another contractor were to attempt to spool the wire rope on to the trawl winch. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). The applicable NAICS code is 333923. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, December 21, 2011. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Robin.Resweber@noaa.gov.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225- 13, 52.232-33.

<p>The following clauses are incorporated into the solicitation in full text:</p>
<p>52.27-103-72 DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT BUREAU OF PRISONS (JUNE 2004)<br />For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing services must have:<br />1. Legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/citizen.htm<br />By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) 1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.</p>
<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.</p>
<p>For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. <br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br /><br />[End of Clause]</p>
<p>52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a Pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods. <br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.</p>
<p>The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are: <br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventive measures as advised by the public health service.</p>
<p>&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all positions performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option. <br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or other emergency. <br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan. <br />Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements. <br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees' personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate. <br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work. <br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties. <br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.</p>
<p>It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations. <br />The Department does reserve the right in such emergency situations to use Federal employees, employees of other agencies, contract support from other existing contractors, or to enter into new contracts for critical support services. Any new contracting efforts would be acquired following the guidance in the Office of federal Procurement Policy issuance "Emergency Acquisitions", May, 2007 and Subpart 18.2. Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>SECURITY CLEARANCE<br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

Past Performance - The Performance Risk evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the proposed requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance. In this context, "offeror" refers to the proposed prime contractor and all proposed major subcontractors. A major subcontractor is defined as one who will be providing critical services or whose subcontract is for more than 50% of the total proposed price. Follow the instructions for submitting the Past/Present Performance Reference Form for at least three (3) references using the guidance below: Technical and past performance when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.
The Government will conduct a performance risk assessment based on the quality, relevancy and recency of the offeror's past performance, as well as that of its major subcontractors, as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Past performance will be evaluated to ensure satisfactory business practices and timely performance (provide no more than three (3) verifiable references with contact information.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested Parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>
<p>ALL PROPOSALS MUST REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a U.S.-based training program ("TR") related to the proposed Transnet Management and Operations Development Program in South Africa ("Host Country").</p>
<p>To meet rising demand in South Africa's rapidly growing rail transportation sector, the Grantee - a large South African rail, port, and pipeline company that is majority owned by the Government of South Africa - is engaged in massive capital investments, including the purchase of new or like-new locomotives. The Grantee's management has recognized the human resources challenge presented in such expansive growth and has requested assistance from USTDA to fund the cost of goods and services for a management and operations training program that will support the development of critical human capacity resources within the Grantee's railway operations unit, Transnet Freight Rail ("TFR"), and rolling stock manufacturing and maintenance unit, Transnet Rail Engineering ("TRE").</p>
<p>The TR will consist of two separate Grantee delegations: one delegation from TFR and one delegation from TRE. The TFR visit and the TRE visit will not take place concurrently. The TFR and TRE delegations will include a minimum of fifteen delegates each, for a total of at least thirty Grantee delegates. The TFR and TRE delegations will participate in TR-related activities in the United States for a minimum of twenty days each, for a total of at least forty days of TR-related activities. Additional TR requirements are detailed in the Terms of Reference ("TOR") for the TR</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$500,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals ("RFP"), which includes requirements for the Proposal and the TOR for the TR, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or the Host Country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the Host Country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee no later than <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4:00 PM local (South Africa) time on January 16, 2012</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take several months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

NOTE:  Please note that Schedule 36 is accepting offers for SIN 51-507, Destruction Services. 

Please note that SIN 51-508, Litigation Support Service is revised to include paralegal support and eDiscovery requirements.

</a>
<DESC>NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take several months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

NOTE:  Please note that Schedule 36 is accepting offers for SIN 51-507, Destruction Services. 

Please note that SIN 51-508, Litigation Support Service is revised to include paralegal support and eDiscovery requirements.

Please note that there is a new Special Item Number (SIN) under Schedule 36.  If your company offers these services, we encourage the addition of this SIN to your contract.  The description for SIN 51-500 - Managed Print Services is as follows:

SIN 51-500 Managed Print Services
Managed Print Services (MPS) includes equipment and services required to manage imaging output that may include printing, scanning, copying, and fax devices in a system that monitors and reports status, needs and usage trends on regular basis.   The MPS plan may be based on a needs analysis completed under SIN 51-501.  Services may include but are not limited to creating a business plan solution that incorporates recommendations for each existing piece of equipment (including removing/retirement/recycling/disposal). The plan may be phased to allow for an orderly progression to the new output environment. The plan should take into account the usage and floor plan of the equipment.
Maximum Order $1,000,000, Estimated Sales $3,500,000, Not Set Aside

Additionally, the SIN description for SIN 51-501 - Needs Assessment and Analysis Services has been updated.

The SIN descriptions for SINs 51-55 - Rental Plan for Copiers, 51-58 - Lease to Ownership Plans (LTOP) Copiers, 51-58A - Operating Lease Plan for Copiers, 51-100 - Copiers, 51-100C - Cost-per-Copy Plan for Copiers, and 51-100F - Flat Rate Monthly Fee  Copying Plan for Copiers have been updated to include Energy Star requirements.

NOTE:  Effective April 1, 2010, the Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWACenter), Schedule 36 will only accept proposals submitted electronically through the eOffer/eMod system.  The eOffer/eMod system is a web based application that allows contractors to electronically prepare and submit proposals.  Offerors must obtain a valid digital certificate in order to use the eOffer/eMod system.  For information on how to obtain digital certificates per DUNs number, please see the following link:  http://eoffer.gsa.gov/eoffer_docs/compliCert.html

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.***<BR><BR>For this solicitation, Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is taking this action in an effort to improve both vendor access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, competed, real-time bids.All responsible Offerors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Offerors that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Offerors that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Offerors may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should offerors require additional clarification, notify the point of contact or FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Brand Name Justification:Brand Name JustificationSybase has been used at the NRC since 1996 to support its present and future implementation of client-server and Web applications. The Sybase software has been tested, implemented and remains in NRC?s infrastructure. These licenses are to ensure that all NRC employees and contractors utilize Sybase software legally.  Sybase is approved by the NRC Enterprise Change Control Board (ECCB) and is listed in the Enterprise Architecture (EA) Technical Reference Model as authorized software to be used at the NRC environment.  The Sybase software has been thoroughly tested and all client-server and Web applications utilizing Sybase currently have an Authority to Operate (ATO). Introducing a new DBMS would require additional funding for modifications and testing of existing production applications. In summary, purchasing software already in use is a response to guidance specified in NRC?s IT/IM Strategic Plan and the Technical Reference Model, and allows the client-server and Web systems to maintain its ATO.  A loss of the ATO would cause an interruption in service that the infrastructure cannot afford. The offeror shall direct all questions relating to this solicitation only to the NRC Contract Specialist.  The offeror shall direct any questions relating to the fedbid.com website to fedbid.com by email or by telephone.
All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. All resellers must be "authorized" resellers of the products list.<BR><BR>The Government will only consider open market quotations.  Quotations from Federal Supply Schedule contracts or GWAC contracts will not be considered.
Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy.
Offers shall attach the license agreement with their bids.<BR><BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination.<BR><BR>(b) Submission of quotations. Submit quotations according to the instructions in the solicitation before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations should show? (1) The solicitation number; (2) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary; (3) If license agreement(s) apply, provide a copy of the applicable license agreement(s);(4) Documentation that shows how the offered products comply with Section 508 standards that are included elsewhere in this solicitation (if applicable);(5) If the offeror is a reseller/business partner and is offering product(s) that their company does not manufacture, the offeror should provide evidence that the offeror is authorized by the original equipment manufacturer to sell the products or services being offered.(6) A copy of the terms of any express warranty being offered for the offered products; (7) FOB Destination-based firm-fixed-price and any discount terms.

Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.

<DESC>The United States (U.S.) Army, Army Contracting Command (ACC) Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG)-Command, Control, Communications Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Aberdeen, MD, 21005, intends to procure Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR), AN/TPQ-50 systems. The ACC APG-C4ISR is conducting market research to identify possible sources to produce up to 56 LCMR AN/TPQ-50 systems that meet the technical performance requirements of the LCMR AN/TPQ-50 Performance Specification. <br><br>This notice is published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Part (FAR) Part 10, Market Research and FAR Part 15, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposal.  This notice serves as a Request for Information (RFI) in support of market research. All information received will be used for planning purposes only. This notice does not constitute an Invitation to Bid, a Request for Proposal, or a Request for Quote. The government will not award a contract based on this notice and will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with responses to it.<br><br>The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is a lightweight, 360-degree, rapidly deployable, man-transportable, digitally connected, day/night mortar locating radar that uses computer-controlled signal processing of the radar signal data to perform target detection, verification, tracking, and classification of enemy and friendly mortars.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is an improved version of the AN/TPQ-49.  It provides simultaneous hostile weapon locations, discrimination and friendly fire observation of mortars, cannons and rockets.  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 has improved accuracy for mortar.  It is disassembled into man-portable cases which fit into a single up-armored M1152 or equivalent high mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV).  The LCMR AN/TPQ-50 is assembled and emplaced on or off the vehicle by a two person team.  Interoperability requirements are delineated in the system Performance Specification. <br><br>The Army is contemplating a firm fixed price (FFP) production contract for up to 56 LCMR AN/TPQ-50 production representative assets and initial spares.  The contract will also include cost plus provisions for support; engineering analysis; and assessment and implementation of potential product improvements not identified at time of award.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 24 months.  The government does not possess a build-to-print technical data package (TDP) for the LCMR AN/TPQ-50.<br><br>Responses will consist of an unclassified white paper.  At a minimum, the white paper shall provide a description of the technical approach and a statement on the ability to meet the attached key attributes.

<DESC>This is modification #7 to the synopsis entitled ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE CONTRACTwhich was posted on June 15, 2011. You are notified that the following changes have beenmade: NASA/JSC is requesting additional information from industry regarding potentialorganizational conflicts of interest (OCI) between the proposed JSC Engineering,Technology and Science (JETS) contract and other existing efforts at JSC. NASA requested information regarding potential OCI in modification #2 posted on August16, 2011 and received responses from several companies.  NASA has assessed theseresponses and intends to respond to each of these companies in writing.  Prior to issuingthese responses NASA is providing an opportunity for additional companies to respond tothe OCI questions raised in modification #2.  The pertinent portions of modification #2are:The nature of the work anticipated under the JETS contract and the situation wherepotential offerors currently provide component and system designs, analysis and modelsthat may be assessed by JETS contractor personnel in support of the JSC EngineeringDirectorate creates a situation where there could be the potential for OCI as currentlydescribed in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 inlight of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues defined below and consider carefully theextent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the JETScontract. Specifically, NASA anticipates that the effort under the JETS contract will include thefollowing types of tasks which could lead to potential OCI issues. This list is not allinclusive.  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for theOrion/Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for theInternational Space Station (ISS) or Extravehicular Activities (EVA);  Assessment of component and system designs, analysis, models developed for thecommercial crew or cargo providers;  Assessment of hardware designs, analysis, models developed for the JSC EngineeringDirectorate by Contractors, Grantees, and Space Act Agreement Participants other than theJETS Contractor; Assessment of new technology disclosures (aka invention disclosures) including, forexample, new and novel hardware, software, processes, and composition of matter submittedby Contractors, Grantees, and Space Act Agreement Participants other than the JETSContractor;  Access to Government Sensitive Information such as pre-decisional informationassociated with on-going or future NASA projects that may result in future competitiveprocurements;  Access to a Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participants proprietaryinformation where said Contractor, Grantee, and Space Act Agreement Participant is notthe JETS Contractor; and  Design, development, test and evaluation including certification and fabrication ofhardware including flight hardware and software. These types of tasks could lead to the following categories of OCI issues depending onthe composition of the team selected for the JETS contract:  Unequal access to nonpublic information of the type that may provide the JETSContractor an unfair competitive advantage in a later competition for a governmentprocurement contract;  Potential impaired objectivity if the JETS contractor or its subcontractors areassessing data developed by themselves, related companies (e.g., affiliates, jointventures, partnerships, etc.), or subcontractors;  Potential impaired objectivity if the JETS contractor or its subcontractors or relatedcompanies are responsible for assessing or performing safety and mission assurance forhardware or data generated by the JETS contractor, its subcontractors, or relatedcompanies under another JSC contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or Space ActAgreement;  Potentially creating biased ground rules by providing technical assessments and adviceto NASA personnel on specific technologies and methodologies that may affect NASAspreparation of a specification of work, other contractual requirements, or NASAsevaluation of proposals in a future competitive procurement. Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: 1. What type OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should youchoose to propose on the JETS contract. 2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that youidentified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience withother contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc.3. Are there any other types of potential OCI issues with the proposed JETS contract thatwere not identified in this RFI? 4. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the JETS contract that wouldcause you to decide not to propose against the potential JETS RFP? A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to theJETS procurement website: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/jets/  . Please reference thisdocument for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCI issues. You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officerlisted at the end of this synopsis. Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. local time onDecember 21, 2011. These documents are for information and planning purposes only and to allow industry theopportunity to comment, as well as promote competition. NASA will not affirmativelyrelease any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may useinformation received in developing the best approach for any follow-on contract strategyand therefore may be recognizable.

<DESC>Sources Sought Amendment 001<BR>*Revision A - For all new submissions and for previous submissions that require full re-work to address this amendment the new page limit is eight pages, not including title page. For those original responders only submitting to the amendment limit your submission to three pages.<BR>For those revising your original submission, please do so following the submission guidelines (incorporating revision A) as stipulated in the original notice. For those responding to this Sources Sought Notice for the first time, the government requests full white papers addressing both the original information as well as the recent amendments.<BR><BR>AMENDMENT:<BR>1)  The government's requirement for JLCCTC will be a CMMI Level 3 by contract award o/a October 2011.  What if any affect will this have on your company's decision to prime/team the JLCCTC effort?  Please provide any supporting information in this regard.<BR><BR>2)  The government has not made a final decision as yet but is considering using NAICS code 541512 which is more in line with the JLCCTC work effort to be performed.  What if any affect will this have on your company's decision to prime/team the JLCCTC effort?  Please provide any supporting information in this regard. <BR><BR>3)   Based on the NAICS code of 541512, please state whether you would be a large or small business and whether you intend to prime or not.  Please any supporting information in this regard.<BR><BR>4)  The governments requirement for JLCCTC will necessitate facilities and personnel clearances for classified (US Secret NOFORN up to TS-SCI, SI/TK) work efforts*. This Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) must be operational and have the appropriate certifications and accreditations to handle this work effort in a development engineering environment prior to contract award.  Work efforts will necessitate involvement with the DIL/JDIF labs and other Research Park Developers/Academia here locally in Orlando, Florida. As such the government will require the design/development efforts be co-located within the vicinity of the greater Orlando area to ensure operational/technical efficiencies are maximized to mitigate schedule and performance risk.  What if any affect will this have on your company's decision to prime/team the JLCCTC effort?  Please provide any supporting information in this regard.<BR><BR>*Please refer to National Industrial Security Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M, 28 February 2006) for further information.<BR><BR>5)   The government's intent is to provide/disclose all available software and documentation that supports the current JLCCTC model's baselines in the RFP. The government understands that there may be gaps/voids (i.e., conversion of software to a more open architecture) which are minor in nature when considering the JLCCTC system of systems. The government's intent is for the contractor to find solutions that will bridge/fill such gaps, both in software and documentation, with minimal impact on development schedules.  What would you suggest/recommend as an approach to overcome these kinds of gaps/voids?  Please provide any supporting information in this regard.<BR>

Participation will be limited to three individuals from interested firms, one of whom shall be a project or program manager. <BR><BR>Industry Day, One-on-One Sessions:  The Government invites potential offerors to participate in a 20-minute one-on-one sessions to answer questions and to discuss acquisition strategy. Upon registering for Industry Day, provide your intent to participate in a one-on-one session that will be available beginning the afternoon of December 9, 2010.  Based on the number of interested parties, your point of contact will be notified of your scheduled 20-minute one-on-one discussion with members of the Government project team. <BR><BR>Program Overview:  JLCCTC is a constructive modeling and simulation capability that contributes to the Army Training Mission Area by providing appropriate levels of resolution and fidelity to support unit collective and combined arms training.  JLCCTC is a large/complex software intensive System of Systems currently comprised of Multi-Resolution Federation (MRF), Warfighters Simulation (WARSIM), and Entity Resolution Federation (ERF). The effort requires support software development, testing, and software integration ultimately culminating into a single unified architecture. Also required are Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS). <BR><BR>JLCCTCs key capabilities include modeling of the following functional areas:  ground maneuver, intel, logistics, after action review, non-lethal effects, as well as employing a cross domain security solution.  Additionally, JLCCTC incorporates Government furnished common products such as terrain data and a Command & Control (C2) adapter.  JLCCTCs external interfaces include integration with the Joint Land Virtual Constructive (JLVC) federation, One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF), Live Virtual Constructive Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA), Multiple Unified Simulation Environment (MUSE), Intelligence Electronic Warfare Tactical Proficiency Trainer (IEWTPT), and Air & Space Cyber Constructive Environment (ASCCE).  Therefore technical integration in JLCCTC occurs at both an internal level as well as externally to establish interfaces with other simulation suites to form a large/complex system of systems.<BR><BR>The development cycle is generally nine (9) to fifteen (15) months in duration and the length is dependent upon the use of JLCCTC in a Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRX) or Warfighter Exercise (WFX)/Full Spectrum Exercise (FSX); the introduction of new components; the amount of new functionality; and the overall volume of requirements that occur in creating a complex capability as determined by PM ConSim in conjunction with the Combat Developer and the National Simulation Center (NSC).  The Government will provide current JLCCTC baselines for use in developing an approach to meeting requirements for consolidation into a single configuration managed effort.<BR><BR>Acquisition Approach: The Government is developing an acquisition strategy for JLCCTC and is considering several strategies which include 1) delivery order/s under a PEO STRI multiple award IDIQ contract or 2) a single award IDIQ contract in accordance with FAR Part 16 or 3) contract award in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The Government is also considering using a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) price format.  Some of the areas to consider in the acquisition strategy for this effort include but are not limited to the following: <BR>" Support of an Integrated Product and Process Management (IPPM) paradigm requiring concurrent engineering with the other simulation programs. It is required that management and development support a technology insertion strategy to accommodate evolving technology and to manage risk associated with selecting technologies that are immature. An Integrated Development Facility requirement in/near Orlando, Florida, to support the JLCCTC efforts. <BR>" An unclassified JLCCTC baseline to support classroom training; pre-exercise seminars, unit rehearsals; Army National Guard/Reserve training; validation; and Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS)/exercise user support efforts is required. <BR>" A Secret JLCCTC baseline to support Battle Command, Battlestaff and functional Intelligence and Command and Staff training. <BR>" A Top Secret JLCCTC baseline to support Intel training and be developed in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) located in the contiguous 48 states. This SCIF must be operational, contractor managed, and has the appropriate certifications and accreditations to handle this work effort in a development engineering environment prior to contract award.<BR>" A minimum of level 3 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Certification prior to proposal submittal.  <BR><BR>Consider the following in your RFI response:  The Government is requesting feedback from Industry in the following areas for acquisition planning consideration to: <BR><BR>(1) Enhance competition and provide business opportunities; <BR>(2) Determine the contract method to be either Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, or, FAR Part 16. Types of Contracts and describe why a particular contract method might be more appropriate for the JLCCTC effort; <BR>(3) Determine the appropriate contract type (contract types pricing arrangements) to be used alone or in a hybrid combination (FFP, CPFF and T&M) and explain why a particular contract type or combination of contract types might be more appropriate (benefits and impediments), how that proposed contract type would affect costs; <BR> <BR>Responses:<BR><BR>The Government is requesting to have your response regarding the Acquisition Approach by December 1, 2010; which can be emailed to the Contract Specialist. Contractors will also have an opportunity to ask questions at the Industry Day event or during one-on-one meetings if requested in advance. <BR><BR>Parties interested in providing information in response to this RFI are invited to provide the following:  <BR><BR>" Introductory statement that includes at least the following: <BR>  o Organizational Name, Address and Point of Contact information <BR>  o DUNS and CAGE Code <BR>  o Small Business sources responding should state their business size status based  on NAICS code 541512 and whether they are interested as a prime or subcontractor<BR>  o Business size and type (i.e., large, foreign, small disadvantaged, veteran owned, minority owned, etc.) <BR><BR>" Responses that are limited to a total of not more than 5 pages that are not larger than 8   x 11 for each sheet. Reponses in CD format are acceptable, but must be readable in at least Microsoft Office 2003 and/or Adobe Reader Professional 8.<BR><BR>Replies to this RFI should be sent to the following Points of Contact:  <BR><BR>Sean Johnson, Contract Specialist, sean.j.johnson2@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>Denise Martin, Contract Specialist, denise.martin8@us.army.mil.<BR><BR>NOTE: This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR 15.201, Exchanges With Industry Before Receipt of Proposals.

2)	stairwells ,
3)	elevators and escalator shafts,
4)	building equipment and service areas,
5)	entrance and elevator lobbies, stacks and shafts, and

<DESC>NOTICE II: The purpose of this modification to the presolicication notice is to update the approximate release dates of the Draft RFP and Final RFP for VA RTLS acquisition.  The release of the Draft RFP, which will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, will be on or before December 9, 2011.  The release date of the Final RFP, which will also be posted to the FBO website, will be on or before December 30, 2011.

NOTICE I: The purpose of this modification to the presolicitation notice is to update the approximate release dates of the Draft RFP and Final RFP for VA RTLS acquisition.  The release date of the Draft RFP, which will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, will be on or before December 6, 2011.  The release date of the Final RFP, which will also be posted to the FBO website, will be on or before December 16, 2011.  All other information provided in the presolicitation notice remains unchanged.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) anticipates issuance of a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) VA118A-12-RP-00118 for Real Time Location Systems (RTLS).  In support of VA Transformation Initiative Health Care Efficiency, the RTLS solution shall support the objectives of focused clinical and administrative process efficiency and total asset visibility.  The mission of the RTLS Program is to provide multiple technologies to include Wi-Fi based location finding, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and a number of other location technologies, such as ultrasound and infrared when a Wi-Fi based solution is not feasible. These technologies will be used to track the location and flow of assets and people, as well as monitoring factors, such as temperature.  These capabilities can result in the design of more optimal processes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of patient care, reductions in staff hours spent searching for equipment, and the ability to maintain more accurate less expensive inventory levels within VA.  The purpose of the RTLS solution is to improve the efficiency of targeted business processes in its hospitals, clinics, offices and cemeteries to support the missions of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and other VA entities.  The designated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334119, Other Computer Peripheral Equipment with a business size standard of 1-1000 employees.  TAC VA is contemplating award of an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. TAC VA anticipates that the acquisition will result in one award. The release date of the Draft RFP, which will be posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, will be on or before December 16, 2011.  Participation in the site visits for VA Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) 23 will be required for each contractor who will be submitting a VA RTLS proposal.  The site visits will be conducted in January 2012.  Locations included in the site visits are the following: Iowa City, IA; Omaha, NE; Lincoln, NE; Grand Island, NE; Minneapolis, MN; Des Moines, IA; Fargo, ND; Sioux Falls, SD.  The schedule will be provided in the final solicitation.  Vendors shall submit questions, comments and recommendations on the RFP to Robert Spierto via email at Robert.Spierto@va.gov.

<p>Period of Performance:<br />01/01/2012 - 12/31/2012<br /><br />Amount: $4,550.00</p>
<p>Vendor:<br />American Proficiency Institute, Inc.<br />1159 Business Park Dr.<br />Traverse City, MI 49686-8670<br />DUNS: 622673804<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to fulfill the requirements of CLIA which requires every laboratory to subscribe to a proficiency testing program. It is in the best interest of the Government to obtain proficiency testing service from API, Inc. as the only responsible vendor. Award to any other source would create substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br /><br />Prospective vendors may submit a notice of interest and capabilities in response to this notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract action upon receipt of any responses shall be within the sole discretion of the Government.</p>

   (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
 
     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;
 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
 
     (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
         (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
       (ii) Examples.
 
         (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
         (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
         (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 
     (1) Listed end products.
 
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin
 
	
	
	
	
	
 
     (2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.
 
   (j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly--
 
     (1) __ In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or
 
     (2) __ Outside the United States.
 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
 
     [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and
 
       (iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.
 
     [  ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003- 4(d)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

       (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));
 
       (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and
 
       (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
 
     (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
 
       (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

     (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).  If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.
 
     (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).
 
       [  ] TIN:  _____________________.
 
       [  ] TIN has been applied for.
