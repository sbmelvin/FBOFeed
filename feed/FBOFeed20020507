<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   NAICS Code: 541620 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Center for Environmental Assessment, located in CINCINNATI, OHIO plans to use simplified acquisition procedures to acquire on a competitive basis a high quality, written report on the toxicological  effects of 1,2- 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The title of this document is, "Toxological Review for 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (CASRNs 95-50-1, 541-73-1, 106-46-7)," and includes preparation of appended RfD, RfC and Cancer Summary Sheets. The document will support the health assessments  for 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene and will be loaded onto the IRIS database.  The Integrated Risk Information Sysytem (IRIS) is an EPA data base containing the Agency's consensus scientific position on potential adverse human health effects that could result from chronic exposure to  environmental contaminants. The IRIS data base contains chemical specific summaries of qualitative and quantitative health information that support the first two steps of the risk assessment process, i.e., (1) hazard identification and (2) dose response evaluation. IRIS data base includes the oral  reference dose (RfD) for noncancer health effects resulting from oral exposure, the inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for noncancer health effects resulting from inhalation exposure, and carcinogenicity assessments for both oral and inhalation exposure.  The IRIS review process consists of:  solicitation of scientific information from the public via a Federal Register notice; the development of the "Toxicological Review," which combines cancer and noncancer assessments as a preferred support document for IRIS entries; and the use of rigorous external peer review procedures for the  Toxicological Review and IRIS summaries. The final consensus review replaces the old CRAVE and RfD/RfC Work Groups. 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (DCB) have been selected to be on the IRIS health assessment list. The development of the Toxicological Review and Summary Sheets for DCBs started  in FY01 and is expected to be completed in FY03.  This effort will involve performing 1.) an updated literature search and review of submitted literature searches and documentation and 2.) the preparation of a document on the toxicological effects of 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene.  All  responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be evaluated and considered by the EPA. This procurement will be processed using full and open competition under FAR Part 13. It is anticipated that requests for quotations shall be issued around 05/24/02, with quotes due around 05/31/02. all  interested parties should submit a request to Josh Bowers, using the following methods: 1.) by fax to 513-487-2109, or 2.) by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation PR-OH-02-00314. No telephone requests will be honored.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families(ACF) through the Program Support Center, Division Acquisition Management (AOS) intends to award a twelve (12) month contract, with four one (1) year options.  The contractor shall provide for the "Evaluation of Independent Living Programs Funded Under the Chaffee Foster Care Independence Program".  The Program is a multi-site, Congressionally-mandated study that necessitates experience and expertise in social science research and evaluation, including the methodological skills for designing and conducting experimental studies and the capacity to collect first-hand data from hundreds of program participants, as well as control group participants, on a nationwide level.  Moreover, the contractor is required to have experience and the resources to conduct longitudinal research, which requires tracing, locating, and maintaining participation of youths, many of whom will be homeless or transient, over a two-to-three year period of time, in multiple sites.  Sophisticated statistical techniques are required for analyzing longitudinal data across multiple sites, which will require significant academic experience in longitudinal modeling, in hierarchical statistical analysis, and in handling missing data.  The contractor must be able to hire, train, supervise, and manage qualified field staff in multiple, geographically dispersed locations.  The contractor also should have substantive knowledge of the child welfare and foster care fields, as well as substantive knowledge of youth development issues.  The anticipated release date for the RFQ is on or about May 31, 2002. Requests for copies of the RFQ must be in writing and may be requested by fax (202) 690-6630.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a multi-channel Filter / Amplifier system that provides low noise and phase/amplitude matched characteristics over a large bandwidth.  For the frequency domain analysis, the filters need to have a flat pass band and sharp attentuation at the cutoff frequency. Additionally, the system shall be compatible with the Precision Filter, Inc. System 6000. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Precision Filters, Inc. which is the only responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the agency requirements.  The items must be compatible with existing equipment owned by NASA LaRC and manufactured by Precision Filters. Additionally, the required equipment must be compatible with existing control software. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to become qualified to perform the services and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 16, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a medium security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) to be located in Pollock, Louisiana.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed institution is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a campus plan arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The FCI will have a gross building area of approximately 56,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The Design-Build Base contract award will be for design and schedule development services, and is anticipated for approximately late Summer of 2002.  The option for major construction is anticipated in late Fall 2002 and subject to funding availability for fiscal year 2003.   The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Louisiana.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, security electronics or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Louisiana to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors located within the State of Louisiana is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is also encouraged.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 12, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, evaluation factors (Past Performance, Capability to Perform, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, and Technical Approach) and submission information for interested Design-Build firms to prepare their Phase One qualification proposals.  Phase One qualification proposals  will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors (Past Performance, Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions, Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Management and Scheduling Approach, Small Business Subcontracting, and Quality Assurance and Quality Control) are significantly more important than price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.

Miller, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Construction Contracting Section, 320 First Street, NW, 500-6, Washington, DC 20534.

The price history is provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for offer/bid. Documentation is adequate for full and open competition; however a cquisition from any source other than Transtechnology Corporation Breeze-Eastern would require first article submission and testing.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), on behalf of its National Petroleum Technology Office (NPTO), seeks applications for cost-shared development and  demonstration projects using advanced technologies that address specific high risk domains in the United States. The proposed project can address a technical risk that impacts the technology?s full acceptance by the independents working in one of three areas; the shallow shelf Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and the Rocky Mountain Frontier.  Or the proposed project can address the critical problems associated with exploration of these regions.  The goal is to provide technical solutions to issues that are limiting domestic on-shore or off-shore oil  exploration and production by independent oil producing companies while providing the same or higher levels of environmental protection expected under the law. Applications will either address: 1) Existing Fields - established production areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and Rocky Mountain Frontier regions, or 2) Exploration - in the very complicated environments of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and Rocky Mountain Frontier regions. Projects do not need to be limited to one area of operations.   They may address exploration, drilling and completion, well stimulation, enhanced oil recovery or other operational issues.  They can involve several processes and seek to test a management process.  The proposed project must however address the identified problems in such a way that evaluation of the success or failure can occur and the reasons can be attributed clearly to the technology or some other identified factor. The proposed projects must contain a field demonstration. The solicitation targets projects in three areas: shallow  offshore Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, and  Rocky Mountain Frontier.  Projects will be accepted that address problems affecting independent exploration and production in these areas.  The program is not intended to simply provide additional government funding to a proposed capital or venture project operated by an independent operator.  Projects should describe how the proposed project expects to increase the oil and gas production in one of the three identified high risk regions.  The goal is to assist the operator in testing new technology or processes and extending their expertise into these high risk domains in an effort to create a broader reserve base for the Nation using its own entrepreneurs. The two areas of interest for this solicitation are: Area of Interest 1 - Existing Fields - The projects in this area will promote the goals of the National Energy Policy to use new technology to promote enhanced oil and gas recovery in established production areas of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska and Rocky Mountain Frontier regions.  It addresses the technical risk associated with developing, testing and deploying a new technology under actual field conditions.  This program provides the connection between the laboratory and the field and applications are expected to provide documentation of the need for this technology and the problem that it will address.  The program allows continued development of a technology to create evolutionary improvements in performance and then the demonstration of such improvements in actual field conditions. Area of Interest 2 - Exploration - The projects in this area target the National Energy Policy goal of advancing new exploration methodologies and technology through the partnership with the independent producers conducting exploration in very complicated environments.  The DOE will partner with independent producer in an effort to push the limits of standard exploration technologies and to improve them. Applications are expected to describe the overall exploration problem in the exploration of deeper formations in the Shallow offshore Gulf of Mexico, the oil-prone areas of Alaska, or the Rocky Mountain Frontier and propose the technical solution to the identified problem.  They should address the need of the independent operator with regard to this region and show that the project provides such a solution to the problem or problems. This competitive solicitation will be restricted to domestic independent operators.  For the purposes of this solicitation, the DOE has adopted the definition of an ?Independent Producer? published by the IRS (IRC 613A(d)), which states that a firm is an Independent if its refining capacity is less than 50,000 barrels per day in any given day or their retail sales are less than $5 million for the year. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Main items of work shall consist of constructing 950 feet of access road, a 65'x70' turnaround/parking area, a 0.25-acre wetland, and 1,500 feet of hiking trail.

The access road will be 14-feet wide (10 feet of roadway with 2-foot shoulders). The road and turnaround will be constructed with side ditches and culverts for drainage, and paved with 4-inches of Class 1 aggregate.  Nonwoven geotextile fabric will be installed beneath the 4-inch of Class 1 aggregate to support the stone.  Work will include surveying, clearing and grubbing of trees, and moving approximately 750 cubic yards of earth.  The constructed fill will require placing material in 12-inch lifts and traversing each lift surface with a track of a dozer.  Other work items include furnishing and installing 400 feet of guardrail, 120 feet of 24-inch HDPE culvert, and five 20-foot sections of 12-inch HDPE culverts.  Approximately 1,900 square yards of geotextile fabric and 425 tons of Class 1 aggregate is needed to pave the road and turnaround area. 

The wetland will consist of excavating approximately 600 cubic yards of earth.  The depth of the wetland will vary from 12 to 24 inches.  No layout is required for the wetland or the hiking trail.  NRCS will locate each in the field for the contractor.

Constructing the 8-foot wide hiking trail will require some minor clearing and earthwork.   Four (4) feet of the 8-foot wide trail will be paved with 4-inches of Class 1 aggregate over top of geotextile fabric.  Excavated material from the wetland will be used to construct a portion of the trail.  Approximately 750 square yards of geotextile fabric and 120 tons of Class 1 aggregate will be used to pave the hiking trail. 
 
Upon completion of work, all disturbed areas will be seeded and mulched.  It is estimated that 2.4 acres will be disturbed.

A prebid/site showing conference is scheduled for May 30, 2002, at  10:00 a.m.   Plan to meet at the Ritchie County 4-H Camp.  You can reach the 4-H Camp by heading East on Route 50 from Parkersburg or West on Route 50 from Clarksburg, then follow Route 50 to the Harrisville/Route 16 South Exit, then proceed on Route 16 approximately four (4) miles, on the right hand side of Route 16 there is a sign for the 4-H Camp, turn right and follow the road to the camp parking lot.

The estimated range of this project is under $100,000.00.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 234990.  The small business size standard is no more than $28.5 million average annual receipts for an offeror's preceding 3 fiscal years.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Insuractive Inc., 1630 Duke Street, 3rd Floor, Alexander, VA  22314 in accordance with FAR 13.1061(b)(1) for a continuation of existing services. The contractor shall perform the following tasks: Task 1 Develop Ideas for Information Visualization; Task 2 Storyboard scenario and prototype user interface; Task 3 Consulting Services for Information Visualization. The government shall provide the contractor access to relevant SIS information and staff. The contractor shall provide consulting services as needed related to the implementation of the SIS Information Visualization plan and other tasks and projects associated with SIS responsibilities with respect to visualization. The contractor shall implement Tasks 1-3 during the period of performance.  The contractor shall meet with selected members of the SIS on an as needed basis. The contractor shall attend meetings held at the NLM site. All resulting software, reports, and artwork will become property of the government. The Division of Specialized Information Services at the National Library of Medicine requires the expertise of Ms. Mary Higgins, a graphic and computer artist and web designer/developer to develop artwork and graphic web design/development and to provide related consulting services. Ms. Higgins has been in the computer graphics and development field since 1992. She has an undergraduate degree in Fine Arts from The Corcoran School of Art and received a Masters Degree in Visual Information Technologies from George Mason University.  At George Mason University she gained experience in storyboarding, concept development and computer animation. She followed that up with two years of high-end computer animation development in the video production field. She is the Art Director/Designer for Insuractive Inc., and has been working with Internet development and design since 1995/96. In addition she is currently adjunct faculty for George Mason University where she has taught Multimedia Design since spring of 1999.  Ms. Higgins is the art director/designer and consultant designer for the web presence of Colonial Williamsburg. She is currently serving on two projects for Williamsburg: an Electronic Field Trip and an overhaul of the functionality and design of the interior the website.  The design objective for Williamsburg is to create an interface that invokes a feeling of the history of the 18th century while creating a functional and dynamic site.  The Electronic Field Trip for Colonial Williamsburg is a multimedia site that tells the story of an 18th century farmer and the relationship of the farmer to his community. This application is similar in concept to the web presence that meets the NLM requirement. Ms Higgins has been working on the NLM/SIS project for approximately one year.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, the Government will consider all quotations received 15 days from the date of publication. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The anticipated award date of the purchase order is May 22, 2002. For questions regarding this announcement, please contact Brenda K Lee at 301 496-6546.

<DESC>The Government is seeking Contractors currently under the Federal Supply Schedule to provide Clinical Risk Manager services in support of the implementation of the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System Patient Safety Program (MHSPSP).   The Government?s goal is to contract for provision of individuals who will become part of the risk management/performance improvement team and work closely with military medical treatment facility (MTF) staff and patients for improvement of clinical processes and systems with the focus of reducing harm to patients.  The Clinical Risk Manager shall be responsible for collection, analysis, display of data, and completion and submission of reports of data and teaching as it relates to the MTF?s patient safety program and patient safety education.   These individuals shall possess a baccalaureate degree in a healthcare-related field, including, but not limited to, Health Sciences, Nursing, Biostatistics, Public Health Administration, Epidemiology, or Biology and shall possess a minimum of  3 years experience in risk management or quality improvement, to include experience in a clinical setting or direct patient care environment.  These positions are non-clinical (i.e., no ?hands-on? patient care) and do not require the individuals to be credentialed.  These services shall be provided for selected MTFs both within, and outside of, the continental United States (CONUS and OCONUS).  The Government does not seek consulting services, but rather individuals to perform services as stated herein.   In response to this synopsis, prospective Contractors shall provide a narrative description of their past performance which demonstrates their capability to provide these services, a list of verifiable references (including facilities, names, addresses, and phone numbers of points of contact) where they have provided, or currently are providing, services, and a discussion of locations at which they can provide services.  The Contractors shall limit their past performance information to no more than five (5) references where services have been provided within the last five (5) years.  The provided information shall not exceed 10 pages of typed text (not less than 10pt) and shall not include any power point slides, advertisements, or other extraneous materials.  Additionally, the Contractor shall indicate their business status (e.g., small business, large business, etc).

<DESC>NA The Garrison Commander, Fort Hamilton, New York announced on 1 May 2002 its tentative decision to retain in-house the DPW Systems Administration, Work Reception and Property/Supply Management Services functions. This decision is the result of a competitive  process conducted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. The decision to retain the performance of the functions in-house was made after a detailed study indicated it was more cost effective to continue to perform the functions by Government personnel rather than by contract. A 30 day public review period commences the start of business on Thursday, 2 May 2002 and will continue through close of business Friday, 31 May 2002. Documentation supporting the tentative decision is avail able for review at Building 111, Room 217, Fort Hamilton, New York. Due to heightened security measures interested parties should contact Mr. Bruce Gorski at (718)630-4235 or Mr. Andrew Rupert at (718)630-4494 to schedule review. Appeals of the decision sh ould be mailed or delivered to Mr. William E. Campbell, Jr., Contracting Officer, 9410 Jackson Loop, Suite 101, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5134. This tentative decision was originally announced in FEDBIZOPPS on 1 May 2002 via Special Notice USA-SNOTE-020501-00 4.

<DESC>Prior synopsis contained information regarding local New Mexico A/E Prime capability award was erroneous information.  Corrected synopsis is below:
Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico (Sandia) intends to contract for Architect-Engineering  (A/E) services for the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) Core Facility. The CINT Core Facility is proposed to be a new office/laboratory building to be constructed near Sandia's Tech Area I. The project's mission is to provide researchers a state-of-the-art facility for performing nanoscale science research.

The CINT Core Facility is programmed to contain approximately 83,000 gross square feet, including nearly 26,000 net square feet of laboratory space. Included in this space are synthesis labs for chemical and biological work, characterization labs for optical and laser work, and Class 1000 clean rooms for integration operations. The building will also include classrooms, conference rooms and interaction spaces to facilitate the exchange of information for multidisciplinary communication and development. Unique design features of the building include: Class 1000 clean rooms with ability to achieve Class 1 with mini-environments, HVAC design for chemical free air streams, and structural and mechanical design to minimize vibrations in floor slabs. Site improvements for this project include security fencing, service drives and yards, signage, parking, and landscaping.  Site utility work will be extensive because of the distance that the existing Sandia utility infrastructure must be extended. The preliminary construction cost estimate is approximately $23.0 million.  

The A/E scope of work includes completing Title I and Title II design and documentation for the CINT Core Facility. Title I shall include a Program Document, Code Analysis, Schematic Design, and Design Development. Title II shall follow with final Design Package and Contract Documents. The awarded contract shall include an option to provide Title III construction administration services, including Submittal Review, RFI Resolution, and Change Order Engineering. Title I design is anticipated to commence in July or August of 2002.

Experience must include: microelectronics cleanroom facilities, hazardous occupancies, general purpose chemistry/electrical/laser laboratories, vibration sensitive structures, integrated whole building  sustainable design, energy modeling, energy management & control systems (EMCS), state-of-the-art communications systems, and design phase facilities commissioning.   

Award of this A/E contract will be based on technical merit.  A fixed price A/E services contract is anticipated. All interested firms should submit a letter of interest, which includes demonstrated capability of meeting the qualifications in this announcement, together with ten (10) copies of their proposal. The proposal should include standard forms SF254 and SF255. The proposal is limited to 30 double-sided pages including the SF254/255.

2)1.	Similar Experience by the A/E Team - Project specific relevance to the CINT Core Facility (include references for each project).
3)2.	Experience of Team Members - Professional Designation/Certification/Education and Technical Experience (It is expected that team members identified in the proposal will perform the work and will be involved throughout the CINT project).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA  93042 plans to procure on other than full and open competition from Northrop Grumman Field Services, Incorporated, 6017 New World Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida 32221, Contractor Maintenance Services (CMS) to various Fleet and shore activities for the purpose of installation, operation, maintenance, logistic support for the C-2/C-2A(R), EA-6B, F-14, E-2C and other various aircraft equipped with E-2C weapons systems, ancillary common avionics test equipment and their associated special/peculiar support equipment and instrumentation.  The scope of work for the C-2/C-2A (R) includes the airframe, power plant, electrical systems, weapons system, and associated test equipment.  Several major modifications are planned to extend the life of the aircraft and current plans are to fly the C-2/C-2A(R) aircraft through fiscal year 2015.  The cargo ramp actuating system will be undergoing a major alteration to enable the C-2/C-2A R to provide special operations forces support.  Extended range fuel tanks will be added as part of planned airframe changes.  These tasks are of a critical nature in that the duties they perform require an immediate response when needed.  The E-2C includes the airframe, power plant, electrical systems, weapons system, and associated test equipment.  Primarily the tasks required are to support on-going test and evaluations (T & E) and maintenance services conducted at various locations under the auspices of Naval Air Warfare Training Center, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD.  This includes modification teams for rewiring efforts and for the installation of avionics changes developed by the OEM.  Support of these T & E and modification efforts require support equipment, maintenance procedures, technical data and tooling which are not available in the Navy inventory.  These tasks are of a critical nature in that the duties they perform require an immediate response for a short duration.  The EA-6B includes the electrical systems, weapons system and associated system and associated test equipment, located at Patuxent River.  T & E efforts include ground and flight test of newly installed or developmental systems and/or modification to fleet deployed systems.  To ensure mission essential and effective prosecution of EA-6B Electron Warfare, contract support includes, but is not limited to Block 82/89A and ICAP III aircraft, Flight Control system, Jammer upgrades, ICAP III receiver Upgrade, and Communication and Data Link upgrades, is required.  The upgrades are anticipated to continue for five years.  The F-14 includes the airframe, power plant, electrical systems, weapons system, ordnance and associated test equipment.  Maintenance services are required at Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division at Point Mugu, CA and Patuxent River, MD.  These tasks support research, design, test and evaluation of new and updated weapons systems.  Some of the test bed aircraft were built prior to standardization of tooling and manufacturing of fleet aircraft.  The OEM is the only source for the technical data and support equipment needed to safely operate these aircraft.  Additionally, the OEM is the only source with the requisite knowledge to implement avionics changes.  The CMS maintenance technicians required for the required tasks perform at a multitude of sites in direct support of squadrons, and must be capable of diagnosing and correcting problems which keep equipment in a down status.  The technicians must be capable of handling the most complex and intricate of equipment problems without hesitation.  In order to perform these services for operational readiness, access to the technical database for the equipment in its current configuration is essential.  The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is the only source available with the requisite data and specific technical support knowledgeable of this equipment.  No other firm possesses the required data andexpertise on this equipment since it is undergoing significant modifications.   The requirement is for an estimated 2,784 man months of Contractor Maintenance Services (CMS) to various Fleet and shore activities for the purpose of installation, operation, maintenance, and logistic support for the C-2/C-2 R, EA-6B, F-14, E-2C and other various aircraft equipped with the E-2C weapons systems, ancillary common avionics test equipment and their associated special/peculiar support equipment and instrumentation.  The period of performance will be 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003, with three one-year option periods.  Responsible sources having the engineering and technical field service capabilities described above may submit an offer which may be considered, to the attention of Kathy Gillespie, T&E Logistic Contracts Department, Code 254300E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 "I" Avenue, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA  93042, or via e-mail to gillespiekj@navair.navy.mil.  The offer must have complete and detailed information that includes the total number of employees and professional qualifications of personnel specially qualified in the areas as outlined; an outline of previous Contractor Maintenance Services (CMS) efforts including specific services previously performed or being performed in the listed CMS area; specific resumes of representatives detailing their qualifications and any other available descriptive literature.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA 93042 plans to procure on other than full and open competition from Northrop Grumman Field Support Services, Incorporated, 6017 New World Avenue, Jacksonville, Florida 32221, Contractor Field Services (CFS) in support of the EA6, E2C, C2, CATE, and F14 Programs.  The EA-6B is the sole U.S. Electronic Warfare platform, after the EF-111 was vacated.  The planned introduction of the ICAP III upgrade and the lack of associated logistics support, demands field engineers to provide technical information and training that is only available from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  With the introduction of the Hawkeye 2000 aircraft, the Group II aircraft updated the AN/APS-138 radar to a new AN/APS-145 with new displays and a fault monitoring system.  The aircraft was re-designed with the new, more powerful T56-427 engine, and new avionics such as the Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and Satellite Communications (SATCOM) were added to the airframe.  The Hawkeye 2000 is the next generation E-2 Aircraft and is currently in production.  Several major modifications are being incorporated to maintain the technological advantage provided by today?s E-2C.   Because of these avionics and structural changes, and the need to support several aircraft configurations at each major site, field-engineering services must be provided by the OEM.  To extend the life of the C-2(R) aircraft, several major modifications were incorporated to the airframe and avionics.  With current and future updates, the OEM will be the only source of information and training for navy maintenance and operations personnel.  Field Engineering Services are required for the CATE program in support of sophisticated aviation test equipment.  Both the hardware and software are complex which require specialized knowledge on the test program sets and inter-connection devices.  Access to the technical database for the equipment in its current configuration is essential.  The OEM is the only available source possessing the technical support capability with this equipment.  The F-14 aircraft are a mix of F-14A models produced prior to the full standardization of tooling and manufacturing utilized during building of subsequent aircraft, and fleet compatible aircraft including late mode F-14B and F-14D aircraft.  Systems and equipment undergo constant update for future RDT&E functions.  Unique test systems and instrumentation installed in these aircraft require a skill level and expertise far beyond that required for normal aircraft support.  Services can only be obtained from Northrop Grumman in order to avoid major delays in the test and evaluation effort and to provide for safe use of operationally necessary systems and equipment.  The F-14B was designed to be a transition model to the F-14D Super Tomcat.  The F-14D was intended, with its vastly upgraded avionics suite/stores management system, to be produced as a mixture of newly constructed and retrofitted aircraft.  Due to the reduction of F-14 procurement funds, new F-14D manufacturing ended in fiscal year 1992, leaving three different series of aircraft to support, each with different radar, engines, and avionics.  Additionally, new capabilities are being added including a precision bombing capability.  As a result of on-going modifications, lack of trained personnel and design data for equipment in multiple configurations, this support can only be obtained from the OEM.  Northrop Grumman is the only source available with the requisite data, expertise, and knowledge to provide update training for the continual modifications and to assist during the introduction of new equipment.  In order to perform these services, access to the technical database for the equipment in its current configuration is essential.  The OEM, Northrop Grumman, is the only source available with requisite data and specific technical support knowledgeable of these aircraft and equipment.  No other firm possesses the required data and expertise on these aircraft since they have undergone recent modifications.  The requirement is for an estimated 1899 man months of Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) to various fleet and shore activities for the purpose of informing, instructing and training Navy personnel in the installation, operation and maintenance of the aircrafts.  The period of performance will be 1 October 2002 through 30 September 2003, with four one-year option periods.  Responsible sources having the engineering and technical field service capabilities described above many submit an offer which may be considered to the attention of Kathy Gillespie, T& E Logistic Contracts Department, Code 254300E, NAVAIRWARCENWPNDIV, 575 I Avenue, Suite 1, Point Mugu, CA  93042, or via e-mail to gillespiekj@navair.navy.mil.  The offer must have complete and detailed information that includes the total number of employees and professional qualifications of personnel specially qualified in the areas as outlined; an outline of previous CFS efforts including specific services previously performed or being performed in the listed CFS area; specific resumes of representatives detailing their qualifications and any other available descriptive literature.

<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications a new concept of a "sound laser" that creates a highly concentrated beam of ultrasonic waves.  The SonoBeamer? device concentrates acoustic energy and emits it as a narrow beam of single frequency sound waves.  In recent years, theoretical attention has been paid to the physics of sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (SASER), which is the sound analog of a free electron laser.  The SonoBeamer is the first known demonstration of the SASER principle.  The SonoBeamer is capable of projecting a beam of directional sound waves into and through a medium, inducing cavitation within the medium along a specified path or at a specific location.  The concept is similar to the medical use of ultrasonics to break up kidney stones.  The SonoBeamer comprises a tube, filled with an active medium, encased by a housing with one end open and the other end closed by an acoustically reflective wall.  Supplied current causes the tube to oscillate, creating pressure waves that propagate toward and away from the center of the tube.  These radially directed waves subject bubbles in the active medium to an acoustic radiation force.  If the forcing frequency is lower than the resonance frequency of the bubbles, the radiation force drives the bubbles toward the pressure antinodes.  The fluctuating pressure waves also cause the bubbles to contract and expand.  On expansion, the bubbles emit waves in all directions, generating a wave in the axial direction.  By ensuring that the radial waves inside the tube are in phase and the bubbles gather at the antinodes of the axial wave, the wave will undergo constructive addition and result in a concentrated, coherent axial beam.  A proof-of-principle SonoBeamer has been designed and fabricated at the Savannah River Site.  Tests confirmed the achievement of coherent wave amplification.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has allowed a patent for the SonoBeamer.  The SonoBeamer should prove to be an effective device for sonochemistry applications, for cleaning of underwater structures, and for underwater communications.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE SonoBeamer, CONTACT JOSEPH P. DUGAN, BUILDING 773-41A, WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER COMPANY, AIKEN, SC 29808; TELEPHONE (803) 725-0848 or (800) 228-3843; or EMAIL joseph.dugan@srs.gov.  Responses to this notice should be received by June 6, 2002.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for parties interested in cooperative research and/or licensing opportunities only.

<SUBJECT>A -- Portable Ge Radiation Spectrometer
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE LLNL'S PORTABLE GE RADIATION SPECTROMETER.

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's portable Ge gamma-ray spectrometer developed jointly by LLNL and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  The spectrometer contains an electromechanically cooled high purity encapsulated Ge detector that requires only electrical power to maintain the required operating temperature. Operation, including cool down, does not require the use of liquid nitrogen.

The unit includes an inner radiation shield around the detector cooled by use of a Peltier thermoelectric cooler.  The inner shield reduces the radiative load on the detector by approximately a factor or two, enhancing the portability, light-weight, and battery power usage for a mechanically cooled Ge spectrometer.  The inner shield can also be used with detectors cooled conventionally with liquid nitrogen.

A prototype spectrometer has been fabricated and is undergoing laboratory testing at LLNL.  The unit has been operating since June 1998.  The prototype weighs approximately 8 lbs, and draws 10 watts DC at input of the spectrometer.
 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Portable gamma-ray spectrometer with actively driven thermal radiation shield should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-009-296.

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Portable Ge Radiations Spectrometer.
