<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB), Voice of America (VOA), and Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB) are seeking qualified individuals for free-lance Radio, Television, Internet, and/or Multi-Media English and/or foreign language news broadcasting assignments in Washington, DC; Miami, FL; and various overseas locations that are not serviced by full-time VOA and/or OCB staff correspondents. Assignment areas include script writing, editing, on-air announcing, technical and production services, photo editing, video journalism, graphic illustrating, producing programming using state of the art multi-media platforms, and audience mail analysis. The VOA broadcasts in English and 44 other languages. These languages are as follows: Afan Oromo, Albanian, Amharic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Bangla, Bosnian, Burmese, Cantonese, Creole, Croatian, Dari, French, Georgian, Greek, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Khmer, Kirundi, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurdish, Lao, Macedonian, Mandarin, Ndebele, Pashto, Persian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Shona, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Thai, Tibetan, Tigrigna, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek and Vietnamese. VOA is seeking qualified sources for the following types of free-lance assignments: Radio-TV Broadcast Announcers, Narrators and Personalities, Researchers, Writers, Producers, Editors, Desk Coordinators, Directors for Television, Radio and TV Production Assistants, Television Makeup-Artists, Master Control Producers, TV Master Control Technicians, Television On-Camera Talent (i.e., Program Moderator, Anchor, Host), General Studio Technicians, Video Switchers, Audio Technicians, Lighting Directors, TV Technical Support Maintenance Technicians, Non-English Language Translators, Narrators, Videotape Editors, Videotape Recycling Technicians, Videotape Recording Technicians, TV Mini-Cam Technicians, Studio Technician Director, Video Researcher/Catalogers, Camera Operators, Character Generator Operators (Chyron), TV/Radio Bookers, Promo Producer/Editors, Audience Mail Assistants (respond to incoming letters/emails from VOA Listeners around the world), and Electronic Graphic Artists. In addition, VOA is also interested in Internet Writers, Editors, Web Designers and Graphic Designers. Furthermore, the BBG's Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB), which broadcasts radio and television programming in Spanish to Cuba, is seeking qualified sources for similar free-lance assignments on the same "as-needed" contract basis as VOA, but with OCB's free-lance work assignment locations being Miami, FL or at overseas locations. The following general information pertains to all of the above-listed VOA and OCB free-lance assignments: 1) Assignments are performed on a contract basis. 2) Most VOA assignments require working in Washington, DC; while some assignments require working at IBB studios at overseas locations. Most OCB assignments require working in Miami, FL; while some assignments require working at overseas locations. 3) Contractor candidates may be required to undergo a background security investigation and successfully pass the security clearance process in order to receive work assignments. 4) Contractor candidates must be willing to work on an "as-required" basis, depending upon the VOA's or OCB's broadcasting needs. Some broadcasting activities require working irregular hours - such as very early in the morning or late in the evening - depending on the broadcasting schedule. 5) Videotape editor candidates should have at least two (2) years experience as a videotape editor in either a commercial or Government television production facility, utilizing modern computerized editing systems and videotape machines. 6) Free-lance assignments are contracted for strictly on an "as needed" basis. The VOA and OCB make no guarantees on the amount of work assignments that contractors can expect to receive. 7) The Government is obligated to inspect all contractors performed work to insure that it fully satisfies the Government's requirements. The Government is further obligated to reject all work that fails to meet Government-specified requirements.
<p>Contractors should note that all work shall be performed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the attached "VOA Journalistic Code". Failure to comply with these legally mandated standards may result in immediate termination of the contract for default.</p>
<p>The following criteria, depending on the type of broadcasting services being contracted, are used as appropriate by VOA and OCB to evaluate prospective contractors: (1) Radio or television broadcast or Internet news experience, including translating and adapting broadcast scripts. Please specifically note that for broadcasting work, the VOA requires that prospective contractors take a voice and writing test. For translation or camera work, VOA requires that prospective contractors take a translation and/or on-camera test; (2) Extensive knowledge of the target broadcast language(s) and the ability to adapt English material into the target language; (3) Ability to produce work that demonstrates a keen knowledge of national and international issues; (4) Ability to explain complex issues in clear, logical terms that can be understood by VOA's and OCB's worldwide audiences; (5) Ability to operate highly specialized and complex broadcast television equipment, such as audio consoles, character generators, wave-form monitors and vectorscopes, and videotape machines; (6) Highly developed production skills, such as: assembling/coordinating material, monitoring program segments for proper sequencing and integration, ensuring continuity, editing broadcast scripts as necessary, etc. ; (7) Ability to research, select, and prepare material to provide background and highlight key elements of VOA or OCB web news reports, prepare and encode multimedia enhancements, and either prepare or request and coordinate the preparation and encoding of additional streamed media, and ensure compliance with copyright restrictions; (8) Documented knowledge (i.e., education/training and/or practical experience) of the principles and practices of journalistic writing, editing, and Internet publishing; (9) Computer skills required; (10) Ability to operate a wide variety of digital broadcast equipment; and (11) Ability to read and analyze incoming correspondence to determine information requested and prepare a responsive and personalized respond.</p>
<p>Prospective contractors are hereby notified that the basis for award will be based on best value; with technical evaluation factors (i.e., strength of prospective contractor's resume, approach to performing work) being more important than the prospective contractor's proposed hourly price. Contractors shall submit their price proposals based on an hourly and/or an assignment basis.</p>
<p>All sources interested in and believe that they have the experience and capabilities to perform one or more of the above-stated free-lance Assignment/Task Orders that are issued under a contract basis with one or more of the above-stated BBG organizations (VOA) at their respective Washington, DC; Miami, FL (for OCB); or overseas locations may submit written inquiries for additional information and/or submit their written statement(s) of interest, technical qualifications, desired rate (hourly or per assignment), and pertinent experience for proposing to contract for one or more of the above-listed free-lance assignments with the appropriate BBG organization(s) as follows: (a) For free-lance assignments with the VOA (Radio) in Washington, DC or overseas, submit written inquiries for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to the Voice of America (VOA), Attention: Ms. Cynthia Krasinski, VOA/C Room 1300, Cohen Federal Building, 330 Independence Avenue (SW), Washington, DC 20237, email address: cakrasin@voanews.com; and (b) For free-lance VOA (Television) assignments in Washington DC or overseas, submit written inquires for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to VOA-TV, Attention: Donna Buchan, VOA/O, Room 2276, Cohen Federal Building, 330 Independence Avenue (SW), Washington, DC 20237, e-mail address: dlbuchan@voanews.com; and (c) For free-lance radio and/or television assignments with the Office of Cuba Broadcasting's (OCB) Radio and/or TV Marti in Miami, FL or overseas, submit written inquiries for additional information and/or contract technical proposals to OCB, Attention: Ms. Mary Ann Amps, OCB/A, 4201 NW 77th Avenue, Miami, FL 33166, email address: mamps@ocb.ibb.gov.

<p>Contractors should note that all work shall be performed in accordance with the standards prescribed in the attached "VOA Journalistic Code". Failure to comply with these legally mandated standards may result in immediate termination of the contract for default.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's Systems Operations Programs Office has a requirement for Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) integration services and support for the implementation of the FAA's Unified Contracting System (UCS).
This Screening Information Request (SIR) is issued with the intention of obtaining competitive proposals from companies who qualify.  The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is as follows:  
541512:  Other Management Consulting Services (Computer systems integration design consulting services)  
Pursuant to FAA AMS Clause 3.3.1-10, Availability of Funds, this SIR is issued on a "Subject to the Availability of Funds Basis".  The actual budget picture for this requirement has yet to be solidified for Fiscal Year 2011 and beyond.  
Scope of Work Contractor resources are required to provide Business Process Management Suite (BPMS) integration services and support for the FAA's Unified Contracting System (UCS).  The Statement of Work (SOW) is included at Section C of the SIR.  The FAA is planning to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Time and Materials (T&M) contract under which these services are to be purchased via task orders.  
Excluded CompaniesThe FAA received assistance from Optimal Solutions and Technologies Incorporated (OST, Inc.) of Washington, DC in the preparation of solicitation documents and in the procurement planning process.  Therefore pursuant to AMS 3.1.7-1, Exclusion from Future Agency Contracts, OST, Inc. is excluded from participating in this solicitation.  
Anticipated SIR Process The FAA is planning a two-phase process for selecting a contractor to perform the required services.  In response to this SIR, offerors are required to submit a narrative describing their relevant past experience as it relates to providing services of a similar size and complexity for similar requirements.  Offerors are also required to address the following: 
-	Completed Business Declaration Form;  -	Financial Responsibility Issues; and -	Company Quality Management Certifications (See Section C).  
In Phase One, Relevant Past Experience and Past Performance Evaluation, the FAA will evaluate each offeror's Relevant Past Experience and Past Performance.  As a result of this evaluation, the FAA will down-select the top five (5) most qualified offerors.  Only the proposals of the down-selected offerors will be evaluated in Phase Two, Technical/Management Approach Evaluation and Price/Cost Evaluation.  Based on the results of the SIR response, evaluation and review, the Government reserves the right to invite more than or less than five (5) offerors to participate in Phase 2 of this solicitation.
The FAA reserves the right to use the scores that result from the Phase 1 Evaluation (related to the offerors' disclosed relevant experience) as part of the overall evaluation and selection process (during the evaluation of Phase 2).  The evaluated scores of the Relevant Past Experience may be used to "weight" the Past Performance Survey feedback provided by the offerors' customers during the Phase 2 evaluation process.  As part of the Phase 2 evaluation, offerors will be required to have the four (4) customers cited on the "Previous Contracts List" submit completed Past Performance Questionnaires/Surveys.
All interested sources are referred to the attached SIR/RFO and attachments.  All responses to this SIR/RFO must be submitted to the attention of John Gamble, and reference the solicitation number DTFAWA-11-R-00005, at the following address:
Federal Aviation AdministrationBuilding 10A, Room 406	800 Independence Avenue, S.W.Washington, D.C.  20591
The date and time for receipt of responses is 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, January 27, 2011 (facsimile and email responses are not permitted).  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals for Submittals.  Proposal submissions must be in accordance with Section L of the SIR/RFO.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined unacceptable.  Oral or written communications with offerors, during the screening process, will be conducted if the FAA deems communication is necessary.
Questions regarding this SIR/RFO must be submitted via email only to John Gamble, Contracting Officer, at john.gamble@faa.gov., with courtesy copy to Christopher Saunders, Contract Specialist, at christopher.saunders@faa.gov.  In order to finalize responses to questions and provide to offerors prior to submission of proposals, questions will no longer be accepted after close of business January 14, 2011, 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The FAA will send responses to the questions by the close of business on January 20, 2011.

<DESC>TITLE <br />Commercial database on pharmaceutical and biotech companies and products <br />SSN-HHS-2010-Database
<p>AUTHORITY <br />HHS issues this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e) and FAR Part 19.</p>
<p>PURPOSE <br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>This notice is intended strictly for market research to obtain information on entities providing commercial database services described below, and ALL entities providing these services are requested to respond with their capability statement.</p>
<p>This is also a Small Business Sources Sought Notice to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519130.</p>
<p>REQUIREMENTS<br />HHS wishes to hear from entities that have a commercial database containing information about specific pharmaceutical and biotech companies and products. This information will be used to conduct market research prior to preparing new funding initiatives, and to identify gaps and opportunities for future research and advanced development programs. It is likely that at a later date, HHS will request that its own data on specific companies be hosted by the database supplier in a confidential manner. Capability Statements must address the following requirements:</p>
<p>a) Database Content. How many companies and product records are in the database? Describe coverage of therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and devices, and also coverage of early stage research and product development efforts.</p>
<p>b) Database Updates. How often is the database updated and how many full time equivalent personnel are involved in the process? Describe the expertise level of those employees. What are the sources of information that are checked while updating the database and approximately how many updates are made per week?</p>
<p>c) Search Capability &amp; Flexibility. What options are available to the User for conducting complex searches?</p>
<p>d) Reports. Please describe the content and amount of data in company and product reports as well as flexibility for printing customized reports.</p>
<p>e) Alerts. What is the process for obtaining automatic alerts and updates regarding new information about specific companies or products designated by the User?</p>
<p>f) Training and Support. How will your company provide training and support to licensees?</p>
<p>g) Hosting of HHS Data. Does your product have the capability (for an additional fee) to host HHS data in a confidential manner and what are the options? Will the data be attached as a single non-searchable field or are multiple searchable fields possible? Will there be a character limit or limit on the size of attached files for data added by HHS?</p>
<p>h) Data Streaming. Is it possible (for a fee) for your company to provide a live stream of data updates that could be incorporated into the User's own in-house database?</p>
<p>i) Other Factors. If there are other factors, not described in the previous sections, that set your product apart from competing databases, please provide a description. For example, you may wish to describe coverage regarding access to clinical trials data, patents, evaluative reports, and financial and licensing information.</p>
<p>j) Access. Availability of single, multiple or unlimited user license. If additional modules (for example, detailed information on clinical trials or a particular area, such as infectious diseases) are considered to be of likely interest to HHS and are not included in the fixed &lsquo;package' please provide information on the additional modules.</p>
<p>k) Access to database for evaluation purposes. Availability of temporary database access to evaluate the quality and ease of searches.</p>
<p>RESPONSE <br />Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Notice must adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Interested qualified organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement, that clearly details the ability to provide the requirements described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by Department of Health and Human Services personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.

<DESC>This is a SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small businesses, services-disabled veteran owned small businesses, HUB Zone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and women-owned small businesses) having the capability to provide professional staffing support for the Biomedical Advanced Research &amp; Development Authority (BARDA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of the Secretary (OS), Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Small Businesses with the ability to meet the staffing needs BARDA has based on BARDA's mission (both included in the description) are encouraged to submit capability statements in response to this Source Sought.
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The government has a need to acquire professional support in project management and technical subject matter expertise to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). These personnel will contribute to the BARDA's mission to provide medical countermeasures that address the public health medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases. <br />The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) located in Washington, D.C. has a mission to provide medical countermeasures that address the public health medical consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) events, pandemic influenza, and emerging infectious diseases.</p>
<p>BARDA was established by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA; PL 109-417), which was signed into law on December 19, 2006. Title IV of PAHPA established BARDA within HHS to coordinate the acceleration of medical countermeasure advanced research and development by collaborating with medical countermeasures developers and manufacturers, supporting advanced research and development, facilitating advice from the HHS Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory bodies, and by supporting innovation in technologies and strategic initiatives (PAHPA, Title IV, Sec. 319L (4).</p>
<p>BARDA uses a comprehensive portfolio approach to develop and acquire a broad array of medical countermeasures including vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and non-pharmaceutical products. This approach includes coordination and co-management of medical countermeasure programs across HHS agencies and other USG agencies and with industry stakeholders through public - private partnerships. Additionally, the pandemic influenza program establishes national networks and Centers to provide and sustain domestic manufacturing infrastructure of these medical countermeasures. Since pandemics by their very nature as global epidemics are not just a domestic concern, BARDA supports USG global leadership and obligations through pandemic influenza programs that support the building of influenza vaccine manufacturing capacity in developing countries with direct funding and technical expertise.</p>
<p>In the CBRN program, BARDA manages extramural programs that support advanced research and development and stockpiling acquisition of CBRN MCMs under Project BioShield including vaccines, antivirals and antibiotics, therapeutic antibodies, therapeutic proteins, peptides, and small molecules. The CBRN MCM portfolio includes candidates and products for smallpox, hemorrhagic fever viruses, anthrax, botulism, plague, tularemia, radiological and nuclear agents, nerve agents, and other biothreats. Additionally, the CBRN division conducts intramural studies with The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and industry partners to develop animal models, improve product formulations and analytical testing.</p>
<p>BARDA's Emerging Infectious Diseases program is currently developing a formal methodology to assess which emerging or re-emerging diseases should be incorporated into the BARDA portfolio. We will next assess MCM needs and gaps through interagency teams, "Blue Ribbon" expert panels, public outreach, and mathematical modeling to support the development of priorities.</p>
<p>Through the experience of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, BARDA has recognized the role of its unique capabilities in a public health emergency response. In addition to supporting advanced development and procurement of MCMs, BARDA plans and establishes mechanisms for distributing MCMs during public health emergencies to complement and coordinate with CDC and ASPR assets and capabilities.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide the following personnel to meet the requirements of the government. Background checks for conflict of interest(s) and ethics training for these positions will be essential for all persons connected with the Program(s) to ensure that no real or perceived ethical conflicts exist. The personnel proposed shall possess the required education, experience, and ability to obtain security clearances to perform under this requirement:</p>

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified sources able to meet VA requirements, to assist in planning possible future technical requirements, determine the appropriate acquisition strategy, and understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of the competitive process.  Telephone inquiries and responses will not be accepted at this time since there is no further information available.  This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.  VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI.  

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the VA is looking for sources able to  provide an integrated, enterprise-wide solution for a Real Time Location System (RTLS). The VA understands the breadth and depth of the desired RTLS solution and is looking to determine the ability of industry to provide a total integrated solution.  

Overview

VHA is comprised of 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) that are each responsible for managing health care activities within their geographic area that can include six to ten medical facilities and a number of supporting outpatient facilities. (Details can be found at http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1) VA medical centers (VAMCs) within a VISN work together to provide efficient, accessible health care to Veterans in their areas.  With 163 VAMCs nationwide, VHA manages one of the largest health care systems in the United States.

VHA seeks a turnkey, integrated RTLS to be deployed nationwide.  The purpose is to improve the efficiency of certain business processes in its hospitals and clinics. The goals for RTLS are to:
o	Improve operational efficiency
o	Decrease operational costs 
o	Maximize equipment utilization
o	Increase clinical efficiencies and staff productivity
o	Reduce delays in patient care
o	Minimize lost and misplaced items
o	Improve the quality of service from patient, physician, and institution perspectives
o	Provide medical centers with the real-time capability to actively track all assets, medical supplies, staff, patients, and environmental conditions (point source monitoring of items) through a common interface and reporting tool.
o	Provide national-level reporting and information sharing through an enterprise database

For the purpose of this RFI, "enterprise" is defined as deployment within one or more VISNs.  Solutions to be considered shall include: application software, all necessary hardware (servers, receivers, ID tags), services (installation, integration, maintenance, training) and any additional ancillary equipment for tracking of equipment, implants, staff and patients.

Requirements

VHA is seeking potential sources capable and interested in providing an enterprise RTLS for the purpose of tracking equipment, supplies, specimens, instruments, staff, and patients, among other possible uses.  In addition, environmental monitoring such as humidity and temperature will be required.  VHA is also interested in the ability of a single source to provide multiple technologies for deployment (using existing wireless infrastructure, non-wireless infrastructure, or contractor specific infrastructure) and the ability to use multiple tags and technologies to meet specifications and specialized needs.  All RTLS data from a given facility must roll up into a single database, and be accessible via a single user interface.  The RTLS system at each facility must also be capable of exchanging data with VA information systems and with RTLS systems at other facilities and/or with a single national information system that serves to aggregate and display RTLS data from all VA facilities.

For the purposes of this RFI, VHA has defined the following space areas.  Please consider all of these areas when responding to relevant questions. 

Campus	Multiple Buildings on an area of land belonging to a facility.

Building	A free-standing structure

Floor	An entire level in a building

Zone	A defined area on a floor:  multiple spaces

Room	Smaller unit on a floor / zone.  Has a defined entrance / exit point.

Individual Patient Care Vicinity	A designated area within a room.  Bed or Bay area.
 

The range of RTLS capabilities with which VHA wishes to begin with initial deployment, shall include but are not limited to the following:

A.	Asset Tracking Capability - Provide VHA staff with the capability to locate portable assets used throughout the medical facility to support the delivery of health care services; varying levels of discrimination should be offered to meet site specific requirements from area level discrimination to more discrete room level discrimination in real time.  

B.	Supply, Processing and Distribution (SPD) Automation Capability - Enhance SPD business processes through automation as it supports SPD staff responsibility for tracking, cleaning and distributing medical equipment to clinical staff throughout the medical facility by automating the tracking tasks.  

C.	Inventory Management Capability - Monitor the usage of medical supplies and equipment necessary for critical patient procedures, particularly in specialty labs, such as cardiac cath.  RTLS solutions in these areas provide real-time transparency for designated items that are "on the shelf", used in a case, or missing.  The RTLS solution can support par level maintenance to ensure maximum efficiency and availability of a wide range of hospital supplies and equipment.

D.	Automated Temperature Capability - Provide real time temperature monitoring for refrigerated areas that store pharmaceuticals, tissues, organs, blood, food, and other items at specified temperatures.  The system can monitor and record temperatures at predetermined time intervals and immediately report any temperature anomalies based on configured thresholds.

E.	Business Process Workflow - Track hospital staff and patients at VA medical facilities, with the objective of monitoring business activities, such as tracking a patient presented to the Emergency Department from arrival to disposition.  The goal is to improve workflow through analysis of the monitoring data provided by the RTLS.

F.	Technical Engineering Services - Required services may include Software Configuration; Upgrades and Updates to all delivered software; Technical Engineering Services (Installation, De-installation, Relocation of RTLS components), Middleware Development services, Commercially available Middleware Services; System Integration; RTLS Implementation Support; Software Development Services; Maintenance, Warranty and Training.  Solutions shall integrate all technology to provide a transparent solution to the user.

Quality Control
The contractor shall maintain a Quality Assurance Process (QA) that will guarantee a product that meets the patient's natural aesthetics & superior fit with minimal chair time.  Use of high quality raw materials purchased from ISO 9001/CE registered companies.  Laboratory will perform internal technical audits to ensure consistent, high quality, and timely restorations.  The contractor's laboratory will use procedures, techniques and current technologies which are consistent with standards of practices in this industry.  This includes the use of Dental Wave 7000 Microwave burnout technology, Cad Cam technology & advanced laser welding. 
Laboratory will provide a thorough infection control process for all incoming and outgoing cases.    All completed services must be disinfected before the product is returned to the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center and 
The contractor will, at no additional expense to VA, re-make all dental items that are not correct or flawed due to contractor error.  For example, if a crown does not fit the die, it will be considered flawed and unacceptable. The crown will be remade at no additional expense to the government.  If the crown fits the die but not on the patient's tooth, it will be considered a flawed action of the government and the remake will be at the VA's expense.  If, in the case of porcelain work, the porcelain shatters within twelve months of fabrication, it will be considered flawed and remade at no additional expense to the VA.

The West Palm Beach VA Dentists will provide legible dental service prescriptions. The Dentists will provide accurate impressions and bite registrations.  If a prescription is not legible or clearly understood, the contractor must contact the VA's Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) to obtain a clear and legible prescription.  
Performance Timelines
Impressions, teeth, prescriptions, finished product, etc. will be picked up from the VA West Palm Beach Dental Service by the contractor and transported to the contractor's laboratory at the contractor's expense. Completed work will be immediately returned back to the location from which it was received.  The contractor must identify the specific type of metal used in each prosthesis at the time of delivery.  The West Palm Beach VA desires that work be returned when completed and encourages daily deliveries, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal Holidays. Pick-ups and deliveries must be accomplished between the hours of 7:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. 
It is the intent of the Government to make a single award to a Small Business with such proximity to the VA West Palm Beach facility as to provide a two (2) hour response time when required to help meet patient's nutritional needs.
All crown and bridge procedures shall be completed within ten (10) working days from the day of arrival at the laboratory.  All complete and partial denture steps shall be completed within four (4) working days of pick-up.  Additional Service:  No charge pick-up and delivery service to ensure that casework arrives on time and safely.

Other Requirements
The Contractor's laboratory must be certified by the National Association of Dental Laboratories.  A copy of the contractor's current certifications must be provided to the West Palm Beach VA Healthcare system with completed proposal.
The contractor's laboratory will offer professional case consultation, responsive and knowledgeable customer support representatives, computerized tracking, and personalized shipping and delivery services.

<DESC>The Global Positioning System (GPS) Wing (GPSW) at the Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB) Space and Missile System Center (SMC) intends to host Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) in January and February, 2011 to support development of the MGUE Technical Requirements Document (TRD). The TRD, anticipated to be approved by the end of March, 2011, will form part of the MGUE Increment 1 Request for Proposal (RFP).<br />The goal of MGUE is to develop, integrate, and produce M-code capable GPS receivers for the designated lead service platforms specified in the draft MGUE Capability Development Document dated 15 December 2009. These platforms encompass Air (e.g. F-15E, Precision Guided Munitions), Ground (Raven, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV)) and Maritime (Arleigh-Burke Class Destroyer (DDG)) domains, as well as a new military handheld unit with modernized GPS capability and improved human-machine interface features.<br />Under the emerging MGUE acquisition strategy, the GPSW is considering awarding contracts for the development and certification of production ready GPS receiver form factor cards for the Raven, EFV, F-15E, and DDG platforms. These MGUE Increment 1 contracts will leverage technologies matured under previous Modernized User Equipment technology development efforts to the maximum extent to reduce development risks and to establish options for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development Phase. Upon successful certification and operational tests/assessments, the GPSW intends to exercise options for Low-Rate Initial Production for these form factors. The MGUE Increment 1 Acquisition strategy also includes development of an Offeror- specified ,production ready Common GPS Module (CGM) integrated into a handheld device and conduction of functional and performance demonstrations of the integrated CGM-handheld device.<br />The GPS Directorate has developed draft Modernized requirements in nine technical capability areas for which Industry feedback is highly desired. These areas are: Backward Compatibility, Space Vehicle (SV) selection, Anti-Spoofing (AS), Blue Force Electronic Attack (BFEA), Net-Centric capability, Key Loading Devices, External Augmentation Systems (EAS), Anti-Tamper (AT), and Interface Requirements Harmonization. On or around December 21, 2010, the GPS Directorate will make available materials relevant to these topics for Industry review and comment. These materials will capture a set of ground rules and assumptions; notional threshold/objective requirements; and questions to prospective bidders for each of the above capability areas. Most of this information will be posted on the MGUE Industry Partners Livelink site. Instructions for obtaining Livelink Access are included as an attachment to this notice. Some technical information will be classified up to the Special Access Program (SAP) level. This information cannot be posted to a contractor-accessible website, but is available only through contacting the GPS Directorate Program Protection Office (PPO). However, a list of titles, to include collateral and SAP documents, will be made available on Contractors Livelink. Requisite facility and personnel clearances must be in place to acquire this information. For additional information, please contact Mr. Vernon Utley in the GPS Program Protection Office.<br />The first TIM is tentatively planned for January 11-13, 2011 and will focus on the GPS materials described above. The first day will involve presentations and group discussion as to completeness, clarity, and consistency among and between the notional requirements defined for the nine technical capability areas. Days two and three are tentatively planned for continued group discussion and/or one-on-one sessions, depending upon Industry response prior to the TIM.

<CONTACT>Danielle Thompson, Phone (202) 648-9015, Email danielle.thompson2@atf.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has an ongoing requirement for lease of antenna sites at site-specific locations. ATF has determined that it is in the Government's best interest to award these requirements with a base year and up to four option years. The vendor names, site locations, and estimated costs (for Years 2011-2015) are identified below. <br />
<p><br />&bull; Western NY Public Broadcasting; Kelley Hill; Estimated Value $70,469.58</p>
<p>These contractors retain ownership of the individual towers where ATF's communications equipment is located. These sites were selected based on a survey conducted to determine what sites could meet the needs of ATF's Private Land Mobile (LMR) system which provides administrative and tactical radio communication coverage needs. Criterion includes:<br /><br />1) Provides the maximum transmit capability<br />2) Receives coverage range for clear as well as encrypted transmissions<br />3) Provides minimal interference on receive frequency<br />4) Provides the best level of safety for ATF agents in the field<br />5) Equipment housing facility and height<br />6) Utility support<br />7) Security<br />8) RF noise level/interference<br />9) Site access<br />10) Telco Access <br />11) Cost</p>
<p>In support of ATF's LMR systems' infrastructure needs, communication equipment is installed and housed in various locations throughout the Continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The locations include remote, mountainous, rural, and/or metropolitan sites. A yearly site lease is established where ATF communications equipment is housed and renewed annually thereafter as long as there is an existing need for LMR coverage to support ATF operations. THIS IS A PARTIAL SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 512191 with a size standard of $29.5 million dollars. Any award resulting from this requirement will be issued pursuant to FAR Part12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide this service, at the above designated locations, interested parties may submit technical literature showing their capability of meeting the Government's requirement by December 28, 2010 at 12:00 PM EST. E-mail your response demonstrating your firms experience and capabilities to Danielle.Thompson2@atf.gov</p>

<SOLNBR>AG-7604-C-07-0025-05
<ARCHDATE>01072011
<CONTACT>James R. Jefferis, Contracting Officer, Phone 5058423389, Email jjefferis@fs.fed.us
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETION<br />(JOFOC)<br />MODIFICATION TO<br />FOREST SERVICE CONTRACT AG-7604-C-07-0025<br />E-GOVERNMENT/ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE<br />MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT<br />Washington Office AQM IT Support Branch
<p><br />1. Nature/Description of Action</p>
<p>The FS Electronic Government program was chartered by the FS Executive Leadership Team (ELT) in 2001 in response to a Presidential mandate (commonly referred to as The President's Management Agenda). The Electronic Government Act of 2002 elevated the mandate to law re-emphasizing the federal government's commitment to delivering services to citizens electronically.</p>
<p>The Forest Service's investment in electronic government has correspondingly grown over the years and is now in the range of $30-$40 million a year. In addition to the electronic government mandates, federal agencies have been required to develop and maintain Enterprise Architecture (EA) programs since the enactment of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Emphasis on this program, particularly from OMB, has increased steadily to the point where demonstrating EA compliance and proficiency is becoming an IT budget determinant for federal agencies.</p>
<p>The FS lead efforts for the Enterprise Architecture and Electronic Government programs are dependent on specialized expertise in a great many technical and business analysis domains. Personnel having these skills are not yet found to any significant degree in the federal work force. As a consequence, agencies are critically dependent on acquiring this expertise through contracting. The Enterprise Architecture - Electronic Government Technical and Management Services Contract is the vehicle by which the Forest Service sustains projects that are transforming the way the FS does business in the Electronic Age.</p>
<p>This justification seeks approval for the following modifications to Forest Service contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 issued to Innovative Solutions Group, Inc. (ISG).</p>
<p>A. Increase the contract ceiling from $75.0M to $85.0M for work within the general scope of contract AG-7604-C-07-0025.</p>
<p>B. Extend the period of performance end date under contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 from 30 November 2010 to 30 November 2011 to allow the issuance of additional task orders pending competition and award of the Strategic Services follow-on contract.<br /><br />The incumbent contractor, Innovative Solutions Group, Inc. (ISG), is a certified Vietnam Era Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) and a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>2. Description of Supplies/Services</p>
<p>This contract provides the Forest Service with a vehicle, for fast and effective access to acquire State-of-the-Art business analyst, technical analyst, software development, and enterprise architecture services to support the Forest Service Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Electronic Government (e-Government) initiatives.</p>
<p>The contract requires the contractor to supply all personnel and resources necessary to provide the Forest Service with management and technical support services for both the EA and e-Government programs. The contractor has performed the following work through task orders issued under aforementioned contract.</p>
<p>a. Recreation One Stop/Recreation Information Data Base (R1S/RIDB)<br />b. Field Data Automation/Mobile Computing<br />c. Weather Information Management System (WIMS) Support (F&amp;AM)<br />d. Enterprise Content Management/ORMS Modernization<br />e. Electronic Research<br />f. Web Information Delivery (FS web internet and intranet web portals)<br />g. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Portal Support<br />h. e-Commerce and e-Collections Support for Symbols.gov<br />i. FS Enterprise Architecture Office Support<br />j. USDA/FS Enterprise Architecture Repository Support<br />k. Electronic Forms (Government Paperwork Elimination Act [GPEA]) <br />l. Information Resource (IR) Governance (CPIC, EVMS &amp; EA)<br />m. Streamlining Permitting<br />n. Business Requirements Management and Information Management<br />o. Electronic Management of NEPA Projects (eMNEPA)<br />p. FS Compliance with USDA eAuthentication <br />q. Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) IV&amp;V and Applications Support<br />r. FS Applications Architecture<br />s. FS and Partner Electronic Collaboration (eCollaboration)<br />t. FS Data Center Operations<br />u. Operate Program Management Office.</p>
<p>This contract has also served as a vehicle for the FS to rapidly engage the services of specific Subject Matter Experts (SME) as well as to quickly start and complete small highly visible projects such as Customer Feedback, People &amp; Places, as well as Information Security and the IR Strategic Framework that would have required significantly longer time to start these projects if they were contracted out individually. To date ISG has subcontracted to thirty-four small businesses, a list of which is contained in Table 1.</p>
<p><br />This contract was solicited on September 07, 2005, as a full and open competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with provisions for firm fixed price and firm fixed price hourly rates pricing arrangements. Additionally, the solicitation went out for bid as a 100% small business set-aside. The contract was solicited with a base period of two (2) years and three (3) one year options with a ceiling of $12 million per year over the period of performance of the contract.</p>
<p>The solicitation was advertised on Federal Business Opportunity (www.fedbizopps.gov). Five proposals were received and all proposals were evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Board (TEB). ISG (ISG) was awarded the contract (AG-7604-C-07-0025) due to their superior technical rating and excellent prices.</p>
<p>The contract was awarded on May 1, 2006 with an initial ceiling of $24 million. In February 2008 USDA issued a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA-08-004) for this contract raising the ceiling to the amount in the solicitation which was $60 million. The contract period of performance was through May 1, 2011 but subsequently readjusted to November 30, 2010. The contractor has up to one year after contract expiration to deliver on any work not completed prior to this expiration. Although it was anticipated that the follow-on competition for the Strategic Services contract to replace contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 would be completed by 1st quarter CY2011, the request for proposal documents are still not complete. Currently, it is anticipated that the Strategic Services contract RFP will be issued in the 2nd quarter CY2011 with award by in the 4th quarter CY2011.</p>
<p>In May 2010 USDA issued a Delegation of Procurement Authority (DPA-08-0004a) for this contract raising the ceiling by $15M from $60M to $75M. To date the FS has obligated approximately $70.1 million to the contract. The FS actual and estimated obligations to the contract by FY are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Fiscal<br />Year Actual/Estimated Funds Obligated Against Current DPA Actual/Estimated Funds Obligated Against New DPA<br />2006 $13.2M $13.2M<br />2007 $11.3M $11.3M<br />2008 $14.2M $14.2M<br />2009 $16.5M $16.5M<br />2010 $14.4M $14.4M<br />2011 $4.9 Estimated $4.9 Estimated<br />2012 N/A $10.0M Estimated<br />Total $75.0M $85.0M</p>
<p><br />3. Statutory Authority</p>
<p>The statutory authority for the action proposed in this justification includes the following:</p>
<p>41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 Only one responsible source, including FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on contracts and FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique capabilities The services required by the FS are available, for the extension period discussed (i.e., prior to when a re-competed contract could be gotten in place), from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy FS requirements.</p>
<p>4. Demonstration of Contractor's Unique Qualifications</p>
<p>ISG's unique qualifications applicable to statutory authority 41 USC 253(c)(1) and FAR Subpart 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source" are as follows:</p>
<p>a. FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) Follow-on Contract<br />The funding for the subject contract represents a sizeable investment in the present contractor team for the FS EA and e-Government programs. Significant work remains to be completed. Awarding one or more contracts to complete the work remaining to one or more companies other than ISG would represent a substantial risk to the FS to get the work completed in the time required and duplication of cost the FS will not recover through competition.</p>
<p>b. FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1) Unique Capabilities<br />ISG created a consortium of small companies with unique experience and expertise relative to the FS's EA and e-Government programs. ISG has also brought additional small businesses on board this contract as the need has arisen. ISG has subcontracted to a total of thirty-four (34) other small businesses. In many cases they have subcontracted to a number of Subject Matter Experts that have provided valuable service to the FS. A list of the thirty-four (34) small businesses and consulting firms that ISG has subcontracted to over the last three years is contained in the table on the following page.</p>
<p>ISG's consortium of small business has unique experience and expertise regarding FS operations and functions that has been acquired from their support of FS business transformation efforts. ISG's consortium has six years experience developing and employing a methodology for transforming key FS common business areas. This accumulated experience enables ISG to perform at a much higher level than a comparable assembly of talent that would have to start from scratch learning the FS culture and business climate.</p>
<p><br />c. Justification for Raising the Contract Ceiling</p>
<p>Obligating FY2011 funds to the contract will result in reaching contract ceiling before the end of November 2010. If the ceiling is not raised contractor support for a significant number of mission critical projects will soon stop until such time that the Strategic Services replacement contract is put in place.</p>
<p>Efforts to re-compete the contract were initiated in late Spring 2009 but existing workload on CIO program management personnel has caused these efforts to proceed slower than expected. It is quite possible that these efforts could take up to another year or more to complete, potentially leaving a significant gap in FS e-Government and Enterprise Architecture contractor support. Putting in place alternative sole source contract vehicles for individual projects could take as long as nine months or more to place. Additionally, a significant amount of corporate knowledge from the incumbent contractor would be lost.</p>
<p>To lose the services this contract provides for any length of time would severely hamper FS efforts to comply with a number of federal laws and regulations including work on the agency's e-Records/ORMS modernization project. It would jeopardize the successful completion of the e-Government and Enterprise Architecture programs which have already cost $150M. It would also put on hold many high profile (with USDA, Congress, OMB, GSA, and the IT Trade press) efforts to meet citizens' expectations for interacting with FS in ways these stakeholders now commonly experience with many commercial sector providers and other government agencies.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Architecture and Electronic Government work has matured significantly in the last 4 years, from experimental innovation to a proven Business Solution. The demonstrated success of the Enterprise Architecture and Electronic Government efforts has dramatically improved the effectiveness and efficiency of agency business processes.</p>
<p>The initial contract anticipated a small amount of use by other USDA agencies partnering with the FS. This past fiscal year, as in FY2009, USDA OCIO adopted key aspects of the FS EA approach and thus found the FS EA contractors as the obvious source for their support needs. The major factor in USDA's continued significant use of the contract resulted from the FS success with the USDA mandated Web Portal implementation. As a result, the NRCS Office of Communications leadership subsequently approved a $5 million, 3-year effort to "clone" the FS Web Portal framework and "reuse" a great many of the Portal components developed and perfected in the FS efforts. The cost savings to USDA and the US Government was significant.</p>
<p>A full description of the projects that would be impacted by a loss of contractor services and the impact on those projects is contained in Attachement A to this document.</p>
<p>d. Justification for Extending the Period of Performance</p>
<p>The current contract period of performance ends November 30, 2010. Although it was anticipated that the follow-on competition for the Strategic Services contract to replace contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 would be completed by 1st quarter CY2011, the request for proposal documents are still not complete. Currently, it is anticipated that the Strategic Services contract RFP will be issued in the 2nd quarter CY2011 with award by in the 4th quarter CY2011. Extending the period of performance of this contract to 30 November 2011 provides the FS technical staff with sufficient time to prepare the documentation required for the RFP leading to successful award of the follow-on Strategic Services contract.</p>
<p>5. Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.</p>
<p>Not Applicable</p>
<p>6. The contracting officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Contract AG-7604-C-07-0025 was awarded competitively with a determination that the negotiated labor rates for all categories were fair and reasonable. Task orders issued under this contract are negotiated using the labor rates determined to be fair and reasonable under the basic contract after a determination that the labor hours and other proposed costs are reasonable.</p>
<p>7. The market research conducted and results.</p>
<p>Adequate competition was received initially. Market research was based on initial offers received and then informally validated based on experience of the current acquisition team with pricing for similar professional services.</p>
<p>8. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The estimated cost the Government might sustain if the contract must be recompeted in lieu of increasing the existing contract ceiling is $35 million of loss to applications under development but not yet completed. This estimate was developed by the e-Gov Program managers and based on experience with the tasks that are underway for the program.</p>
<p><br />9. Listing of the sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<p>10. Actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barrier to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>Efforts to recompete the contract were initiated in late spring 2009 but existing workload for the CIO has caused these efforts to proceed slower than expected. This requirement will be competed in the future as it was in the past. A recompetition will be conducted with a competitive award in time to allow for sufficient transition of ongoing work to a new contractor.</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT A</p>
<p>PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE SEVERELY IMPACTED<br />BY A DISRUPTION OF CONTRACTOR SUPPORT</p>
<p>Forest Service Enterprise Portals: Version 1.0 of the FS Intranet e-Portal and Version 1.0 of the FS www Portal have been released. These deployments represent a solid beginning of a return on an investment of over $50 million made thus far by the FS and USDA in the e-Portal infrastructure.</p>
<p>At present more than fifty-five (55) national forests have a presence on the www Portal, with as many as fifty (50) more in the process of content migration along with 4 Regional Offices, 4 Research Stations and most of the Washington Office staff areas including State &amp; Private Forestry.</p>
<p>The e-Portal is the next generation of the agency's Intranet and Internet (www) environments and is in the process of rolling out a well tested and standards-compliant design that greatly improves the agency's ability to get work done any time and any place employees have a secure connection to the Internet. Apart from the monetary investment, several hundreds of National Forest, Regional Office, Research Station, and National Office staff personnel have invested a great deal of time and energy in these projects.</p>
<p>Halting the contractor support for these projects in their current state of development would introduce lengthy disruption and confusion into the plans of a great many FS staffs and application development teams. Consternation, dissatisfaction, and confusion as to the agency's management capabilities could be widespread and have significant negative impacts on agency morale.</p>
<p><br />NRCS Web Portal Support: In September 2009 the FS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) to support the rapid migration of NRCS public web sites to the required USDA web style and Enterprise Shared Services (ESS) platform by leveraging the FS web portal framework. NRCS believes they can leverage the FS web portal framework to facilitate a more effective strategy for the full life-cycle management of web content and support the enforcement of NRCS-wide web policies and standards. After signing this MOU the NRCS transferred to the FS $2.54M in FY09 funds that was placed on the subject contract to conduct Phase I of the NRCS portal development.</p>
<p>NRCS is now planning Phase II of the portal development which will include migration of all the NRCS state offices to the NRCS portal. In addition, during a status meeting on November 17, 2009 the NRCS expressed an interest in obtaining FS support in overhauling their intranet web site and services as well.</p>
<p>The commitment made by NRCS is a significant endorsement of the FS strategy and technical approach for the FS www portal. Other organizations within USDA have shown an interest as well. Without contractor support for the second phase of this project, delays unacceptable to NRCS could be encountered, damaging the FS reputation within and around the Department.</p>
<p><br />Field Data Automation/Mobile Computing (FDA/MC): This initiative provides applications and tools to efficiently gather field data and retrieve information both in the field and office settings. The Field Data Automation/Mobile Computing project has established a standard mobile computing architecture and mobile solution development process in addition to completing prototype mobile applications to support Natural Resources and Facilities Monitoring.</p>
<p>The mobile solution development process and mobile computing architecture was leveraged to deliver a set of solutions to support an array of field requirements for data quality and employee safety and productivity. Solution proofs-of-concept included Mobile Office, Situational Awareness Firefighting Equipment (SAFE), and Mobile Law Enforcement. Technology evaluation studies have been conducted on mobile computing devices and wireless communication capabilities with many recommendations reaching implementation in the agency.</p>
<p>The SAFE project has been working with many organizations and agencies, including the National Incident Management Organization (NIMO) seeking to enhance decision making capabilities and situational awareness. NIMO teams are interested in testing and evaluating various technology solutions as a force multiplier concept to optimize team management capabilities.</p>
<p>During FY2009 NIMO employed the FDA/MC project under this contract to continue the implementation of the FDA-MC strategy by supporting Fire and Aviation Management (FAM) in procuring test equipment, developing and implementing the requested solutions, training and supporting NIMO personnel and other field users, creating and evaluating field user feedback forms, and conducting an after-action analysis on the impact of technologies on an incident.</p>
<p>The benefits of the FS FDA/MC project include increased safety and effectiveness through real-time field collaboration and decision making, improved data quality for accurate decision support, reduced administrative time for office-bound data entry and retrieval, and significant productivity gains through remote monitoring solutions.</p>
<p>A disruption of continued contractor support for FY2011 would severely impact the progress in rolling out solutions to not only the FS personnel in the field but the NIMO teams for fire suppression as well.</p>
<p><br />Enterprise Content Management (ECM): This initiative provides for the strategies, methods, and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to key FS organizational processes. This includes FS commitments to greatly improve its compliance and service responsibilities for electronic records management, e-Discovery, legal hold, FOIA, directives, and correspondence.</p>
<p>Currently, the ECM effort is focused on two areas: eFOIA and a proof of concept looking at how electronic records management (e-Records) can improve the responsiveness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of not only the FS responsibilities to the National Archives but also to the Office of the General Council for litigation holds. The eFOIA project is in implementation and the e-Records effort is on pace to reach a critical agency-wide implementation juncture at the beginning of fiscal year (FY) 2011. Both of these efforts have strong program, IRB, and deputy chief support.</p>
<p>The goals for the eRecords effort are to make information easily findable and improve business processes; ensure compliance and reduce risk by controlling information retention; and empower legal counsel and reduce cost by enabling e-Discovery. Additionally, the outcomes of this initiative will lead to lower costs in many areas, including: lower "discovery costs" for current and future litigations, lower "restoration costs" for the IT operations staff, and lower "storage costs" since content can be deleted past its retention period.</p>
<p>The eFOIA and eRecords efforts are part of the larger Enterprise Content Management (ECM) strategy. The FS Enterprise Content Management Strategy and Office of Regulatory and Management Services Modernization Study (June 2008) predicts savings exceeding $220 million a year (based on other organization's successes with ECM) with the implementation of the strategy. The current efforts are real, not some paper exercises.</p>
<p>Beyond the aforementioned efforts, the ECM strategy also includes improved collaboration, communication, document management and knowledge management. The development environments have been set up to continue these efforts, the executive support is strong from the program area to OGC to the deputy chief, and real gains are starting to be achieved in the overall ECM program -- discontinuation at this point in time would throw away significant gains that are within reach in the next two years thanks to the investments made so far.</p>
<p><br />Information Resource (IR) Governance: This initiative focuses on using best practices to manage IR investments and the use of IR to deliver maximum business value to the agency and its mission. The four key components of IR Governance are: enable business driven investment decisions; monitor and evaluate project performance; monitor the implementation of investment decisions; and monitor investment performance.</p>
<p>The contractor team is developing a comprehensive IR Investment and Portfolio Management capability that utilizes a streamlined automated approach to supporting the IRB and ELT activities for performing IR investment analysis and making portfolio decisions. The contractor team is leading efforts to establish and improve the Service Request/ Technical Approval implementation process as well as the Earned Value Project Management System.</p>
<p>A gap in contractor support will bring to almost complete stoppage the agency's progress in establishing management processes and decision support mechanisms that enable business driven investment decisions and strengthen compliance with OMB and USDA CPIC policy, directives, and guidance.</p>
<p>USDA and FS Enterprise Architecture: Any halt to or shutdown of the subject contract would make it virtually impossible for the FS Enterprise Architecture program to continue without a prolonged hiatus and collapse of credibility. The ability to maintain and evolve the great amount of enterprise architecture information, stored and managed in the FS EA Repository, and needed to ensure and efficient and compliant IT and network support environment, would all but disappear and EA processes would be forced to revert to a completely inadequate document and e-mail based process.</p>
<p>High profile, very critical collaboration with USDA OCIO EA Division would collapse and seriously jeopardize OCIO's efforts to achieve EA process and artifact standardization across the department. FS federal EA staff would be completely unable to achieve but a fraction of their performance objectives. As much as $500 million of FS IT budget could be put in the high risk category by OMB with potential embarrassment to the Chief, the FS CIO, the USDA CIO, and even the Secretary of Agriculture. Under the current day federal IT regulatory environment an agency simply cannot afford to revert to non-repository EA management.</p>
<p>Electronic Forms (GPEA) Implementation: In 2008, the Deputy Chief for Operations directed that all 600 national FS forms be converted to electronic format (in compliance with GPEA), including modernization of the associated business processes to the extent practical, within four years. The objective of this initiative is to consolidate and greatly streamline the more than 600 forms-based business processes currently in use in the FS.</p>
<p>Key aspects of this effort includes converting paper based forms to electronic; implementing e-Signature for both internal and public-facing forms; providing web-based instead of inbox-based view of each person's work queues; reducing the number of forms required, and standardizing many aspects of agency forms, especially the meaning and syntax of their data elements.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 field forms also exist and are candidates for conversion once the Regions, Stations, and Area reconcile, harmonize, and standardize them to an appropriate degree. Once field-based forms are pared down to a standard set, the FS intends to have the contractor train field developers to convert their own forms, as well as, streamline and standardize their processes. This can be going on in parallel with the national forms conversion effort.</p>
<p>FS compliance with GPEA is monitored by USDA and OMB and used to score agency performance. This initiative relies heavily on contractor support to continue to make progress in FY11 and beyond. Cost avoidances in FY10 alone approach $10 million, savings that would be postponed easily 2 to 3 years or more should contracting support for the eForms efforts lapse as the ceiling on the current contract is exhausted.<br /><br />eCommerce/eCollections Support for Symbols.gov: The National Symbols Program is a key component of the U.S. Forest Service Conservation Education Program. It features America's icons for fire prevention and the conservation of the environment, including Smokey Bear, Woodsy Owl, and others. The FS manages a cache of products (e.g., Smokey Bear, lapel pins, pencils, coloring books, etc.) and presents them along with supporting ideas, activities, events, clipart, audio and video clips, and other lessons for use by educators. The purpose of this initiative is to offer customers an easy-to-use, automated way to purchase national symbols and related materials online. The net revenue received by the FS each year approaches $2 million and this is available immediately to the agency to use in its Fire Prevention program.</p>
<p>In FY10 the contractor is providing an approved electronic catalog of symbols-related products, C&amp;A the business solution, begin to design, develop, and test the new automated sales and inventory business processes, including connecting to the standard government (pay.gov) back-end payment processing system. The benefits of this initiative include providing the technology foundation for establishing an FS web-based storefront usable by all organizational units (e.g., Permits, National Symbols, Four Rivers Lottery Application); virtually eliminating data entry errors into FS systems, reducing cash transactions and associated handling risks to FS staff; saving FS personnel time currently devoted to customer sales; offering the public a 24x7 online solution; offering the public the ability to pay for FS services electronically (e.g., credit cards, e-checks)</p>
<p>Without contractor support the National Symbols storefront makeover may incur lengthy delays that will almost certainly result in a deterioration of the FS reputation on a broad scale as other agencies and educational institutions are unable to conveniently and efficiently arrange, online, for shipment and payment of FS symbols products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recreation One Stop (R1S): is comprised of two major components: 1) National Recreation Reservation Service (NRRS) which provides "one-stop" reservation shopping to the public for a wide range of Federal recreation areas and 2) Recreation Information Data Base (RIDB) which provides public access to non-reservation recreation information.</p>
<p>The R1S project is one of the e-Government initiatives in the Presidential Management Agenda to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and customer service of the Federal Government. The RIDB represents an FS contribution to R1S and within that framework modernization of FS provisioning of Recreation Information and Services. The RIDB has improved access to recreation-related information generated by the various levels of government (Federal, tribal, state, and local), streamlined the systems used to manage that information, and enhanced the sharing of recreation-related information among government and non-government organizations.</p>
<p>While the RIDB is in operational service, enhancements continue to be added to improve the customer experience. Enhancements that are currently being added include implementing a standard interface for government personnel to enter recreation data into RIDB utilizing the new FS Intranet Portal standards; developing procedures for accepting new data partners (Federal, State, and Local) who desire to include their recreational data in RIDB; and adding geospatial capabilities including Google mashups, lines and polygons, and boundaries.</p>
<p>The lack of contractor support for even a short period of time would jeopardize the ability of all current government partners making their recreation opportunity information available to the American public. It would also jeopardize the FS falling into non-compliance with its R1S MOU and risks a significant deterioration of FS reputation as a reliable government partner.</p>
<p>Weather Information Management System (WIMS): is a mission critical, national system, managed and maintained by FS Fire and Aviation Management (F&amp;AM) for interagency use. WIMS distributes critical weather information and climate data to effectively manage resources for fire suppression performed by the U.S. Forest Service and cooperators nationwide. WIMS provides users with automated access to weather observation information, it generates National Fire Danger Ratings (NFDRS), and it processes forecasts from the National Weather Service (NWS). WIMS provides valuable weather observation data to researchers performing fire prediction and file planning. WIMS serves as a primary supplier of weather observation data for the Wildland Fire Assessment System (WFAS), an internet-based information system that provides a national view of weather and fire potential, including national fire danger and weather maps and satellite-derived "Greenness" maps.</p>
<p>The contractor has been providing support for WIMS for over nine years for operation and maintenance as well as the implementation of enhancements. Planned enhancements for FY10 include access to weather information through a geographic interface such as Google Earth/Maps and reduction in the time needed to get the right info to the right people at the right time; providing the ability to view weather information from a variety of sources simultaneously on one screen and providing the ability to access fire weather information using mobile handheld devices.</p>
<p>A short gap in contractor support, especially during fire season, could result in system failure or interruption resulting in loss of data and information, negatively impact timeliness of fire weather forecasts increasing the risk of bad decisions resulting in additional risks to life and property. If problems should occur in WIMS operations, without access to experienced contractor support, F&amp;AM personnel would have no quick means for troubleshooting the source of the problem. As a result these problems, and potentially complete outages, could persist for long periods of time and make the system unavailable for fire planning and fire suppression operations.</p>
<p>eCollaboration: is a web based initiative to establish business collaboration capabilities across the Forest Service to: 1) support agency and partner efforts towards collaborative public land management and environmental conflict resolution; 2) facilitate feedback and the internal and external exchange of ideas, and knowledge among various communities of interest or practice at local, state, landscape, national and international levels of interest and relevance; and 3) enable FS sponsored communities and others to harvest innovations through the use of standard information and datasets, applications of advanced science, and tools which are designed to be used at the community or end user levels such as decision support applications with presentation and data type mash-ups (e.g. Google Earth).<br />eCollaboration will provide the agency with the kind of collaboration capabilities that will be required to implement the mission laid out by Chief Tidwell's common vision speech "Restoring America's Forests through Landscape-Scale Conservation" given to the 2009 National Convention, Society of American Foresters, Orlando, FL-October 2, 2009. In addition, the initiative is designed to empower all units and employees implementing the broad objectives laid out in: a) FS Policy FSM 1600 that codifies policy related to the Department of Agriculture Organic Act of 1862 (12 Stat. 387; 7 U.S.C. 2201), b Open Government Directive and c) many others. Key external co-sponsors for eCollaboration include the National Forest Foundation, Udall Institute, and Red Lodge Clearinghouse.</p>
<p>The primary benefit of the eCollaboration effort is to develop an integrated, coherent, and coordinated agency-wide, cross-deputy portal for information and guidance related to partnerships and collaboration. This will provide for 1) Connecting People including social networking and communities of practice, 2) Sharing Knowledge using electronically searchable databases and content repositories, 3) Identifying Emerging Issues through collaborative inventory and monitoring, 4) Designing Appropriate Processes including legal and administrative support and 5) Supporting Partnerships and Collaboration through "how to" guides and other resources.</p>
<p>The eCollaboration team is completing the first phase of the effort which includes developing the functional and technical design for a collaboration website to enable knowledge management (KM) in support of partnerships and collaboration. Specific knowledge assets provided by the site will include mechanisms for establishing partnerships, methods for working collaboratively, tools and resources to increase capacity and accountability, and connections for growing and sustaining a public-private collaboration community of practice.</p>
<p>A gap in contractor support for the eCollaboration project will stall the implementation of the initial collaboration website. This will cause a significant setback in meeting the requirement to assist in stemming the tide of agency knowledge loss related to the bulge in numbers of retiring personnel as well as setback in realizing the benefits to FS process flow and decision making. In addition, loss of momentum in working with key external stakeholders (such as the NFF and Udall Institute) will cause significant embarrassment of the FS with key environmental collaborators.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br /><br />NO SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS AS THIS WORK IS ISSUED AGAINST AN EXISTING AGENCY CONTRACT.</span></strong></p>
<p><br />The purpose of this Modification 2 is to obligate $3,050,000 in support of six work assignments under Contract EP-C-11-004. These work assignments continue the support provided under Contract EP-C-06-026. Additionally, this modification adds the appropriate clauses required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation for contracts involving ARRA activities. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Work Assignment 0-100 is funded to $1,250,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Work Assignment 0-101 is funded to $303,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Work Assignment 0-102 is funded to $1,164,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) Work Assignment 0-103 is funded to $101,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (5) Work Assignment 0-104 is funded to $100,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; (6) Work Assignment 0-105 is funded to $132,000. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from January 1, 2011 through November 30, 2011.</p>
<p>The objective of Work Assignment 0-100 is for the contractor to provide support to EPA's Office of Water in management and oversight of ARRA funds provided to the CWSRF and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) programs. Management and oversight of the CWSRF and DWSRF ARRA funds will include assisting EPA Headquarters and EPA Regional Offices in the review and auditing of State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs of individual states to ensure proper use of ARRA funds and compliance with ARRA requirements.<br /><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-101 is for the contractor to provide support to EPA's Office of Water in the preparation of State and National reports on the implementation of the ARRA CWSRF Program. The reports will be used to provide Congress and the public with information on how the CWSRF succeeded in meeting the requirements and intent of ARRA.<br /><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-102 is for the contractor to provide support to the Office of Water's Office of Wastewater Management in implementing a comprehensive program management strategy for the Green Project Reserve (GPR) provisions of the ARRA. Key tasks include a comprehensive accounting of GPR projects and an evaluation of their performance. <br /><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-103 is for the contractor to support OWM by working with the OWRB in developing a computer model that will show the beneficial impacts of ARRA funded infrastructure investments. <br /><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-104 is for the contractor to conduct a study on how ARRA impacted a representative sample of the CWSRF programs nationwide. Additionally, the contractor shall also conduct research that results in the development of metrics that capture the projected social, economic, and environmental benefits of communities within the Chesapeake Bay watershed that received ARRA funding through the CWSRF program. <br /><br />The objective of Work Assignment 0-105 is for the contractor to provide services for the management of the CWSRF Benefits Reporting (CBR) Database for tracking ARRA funds, to include, data definition updates and providing technical assistance to States and EPA Regions. The contractor shall provide technical assistance to facilitate reporting transparency, and develop, update, and expand a portfolio of reports on the environmental and economic impact of CWSRF loans made with ARRA funds. <br /><br />The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

They will not be accepted because the acceptance date of the access roster has expired and it would also re-start the process for clearing the new person which takes time. Please do not let them just show up to MK Airbase without being on the<BR>approved list because they will not be allowed in because they have not been<BR>vetted thru the system.  If you have someone that was going to come, but<BR>they are no longer going to attend, please let me know and we will take them<BR>off the list, but do not add someone to replace them.<BR><BR>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.102 (g) and with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Solicitation number is: OPM20-11-T-0002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document incorporates all mandatory commercial item provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-47 dated December 13, 2010.</p>
<p><br />The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 721110, and the small business size standard is $30.0 million. This procurement is unrestricted, allowing both large and small business to submit quotations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM), Employee Services (ES) provides policy direction and leadership in designing, developing and promulgating Government-wide human resources systems and programs for recruitment, pay, leave, performance management and recognition, employee development, work/life/wellness programs and labor and employee relations; provides technical support to agencies regarding the full range of human resources management policies and practices, to include veterans' employment and agency program evaluation; and manages the operation of OPM's internal human resources program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ES's Recruitment and Hiring designs, develops, and promulgates merit-based employment systems, policies, regulations, and programs that Federal agencies use to recruit, examine, hire, classify and assess high quality employees from diverse backgrounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Recruitment and USAJOBS&reg;, a sub-component of ES, is responsible for designing, developing, and managing USAJOBS, Student Programs, and Diversity Policy and Outreach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, Student Programs is responsible for Government-wide student programs, such as <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/EI/students.asp"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">Student Educational Employment Programs (STEP/SCEP)</span></a>, Presidential Management Fellows (PMF), and for building a "student ambassador" and "college recruitment" program.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bearing the Presidential moniker, the PMF Program is a flagship leadership development program at the entry level for advanced degree candidates. It was created more than three decades ago by Executive Order and has gone through many changes over the years.&nbsp;The PMF Program brings in graduate degree candidates from diverse educational backgrounds into the Federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Program is highly selective and competitive. In 2010, less than 900 applicants were selected as Finalists out of an applicant pool of nearly 9,000. After being deemed a Finalist, a prospective PMF must find a job in a participating Federal department or agency. If they successfully complete the requirements of the Program, PMFs can be noncompetitively converted to career civil service status at the end of the two-year period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program assessment process is undergoing significant changes to now include an in-person component to the selection. This component will strengthen the selection process and ensure a pool of high-caliber finalists.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new PMF assessment is a multi-hurdle process, with an on-line, un-proctored assessment serving as a pre-screen for all applicants, followed by a smarter, more manageable in-person assessment for 1,500 semi-finalists in four locations. The online assessment is a cost-effective method for screening an increasing number of applicants. The in-person assessment is a more resource intensive process, which puts semi-finalists through a day-long assessment consisting of individual presentations, group activities, and a proctored writing exercise. Performance is scored against a structured rubric by a three-assessor panel. Finalists will be identified based on a cut-off score of the assessment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, in support of its mission and goals, the PMF program has a need for a single facility in downtown Washington, DC within three to four blocks of a metro station, to conduct in-person assessments of approximately 750-800 PMF semi-finalists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractor shall provide all labor, incidental materials, and other services necessary to render services under the resulting contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is modified to add the following information:
Verification of Status of Apparently Successful Offeror
(a)	 The apparently successful offeror, unless currently listed as verified in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at:  www.vetbiz.gov database, shall submit to Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Center for Veterans Enterprise (CEV) within five business days of receipt of written notice of its status as the apparently successful offeror, a verification application in accordance with 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 74 with such reasonably adequate documentary material, as necessary, establishing as follows:

(1)	The owner or owners of 51 percent or more of the offeror is/are service-disabled Veteran(s), Veteran(s), or an eligible surviving spouse thereof, as applicable, for the instant acquisition.  In this regard, the apparently successful offeror shall submit a VA Form 0877 to CVE via VA’s VIP at:  www.vetbiz.gov, internet site.  This confidential and secure electronic application will enable CVE to inform the CO of the offeror without the CO having to receive and secure confidential individually identifiable information or personal health care information on this topic.
(2)	 Eligible parties own 51 percent or more of the concern (see 38 CFR 74.3).  Adequate documentation can include copies of official stock certificates, articles of incorporation, partnership agreement, operating agreement, or other similar documentation which reasonably demonstrates the percentage of ownership by eligible parties; and  
(3)	Eligible parties control the concern (See 38 CFR 74.4).  Control includes both the strategic policy setting exercised, for example, by boards of directors, and the day-to-day management and administration of business operations.  Adequate documentation should include articles of incorporation, corporate by-laws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, sesames, disclosure of any other current employment, or other relevant documentation, as applicable, which demonstrates control of the strategic and day-to-day management of the offeror by eligible parties, as applicable.

(b)	 CVE will examine the business documents to determine if they establish appropriate ownership and control of the business from which an offer has been received.  Within 21 business days, CVE will determine whether the firm can or cannot be verified as a SDVOSB or VOSB, as appropriate, and issue its decision thereon to the vendor in accordance with 38 CFR 74.11(e) and the CO.  The CO will use CVE’s decision in making the source selection decision.

(c)	If a competing vendor raises a status protest prior to CVE’s completion of its verification examination, the CO may rely on the status protest decision when issued.

(d)	This deviation will expire December 31, 2011.  Thereafter, in accordance with VAAR 804.1102, COs shall only make awards to SDVOSBs or VOSBs which are listed as verified in VIP at: vetbiz.gov.

IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT ALL POTENTIAL BIDDERS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY LISTED AS VERIFIED IN THE VENDOR INFORMATION PAGES (VIP) AT  www.vetbiz.gov  IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THE PROCESS.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to solicit proposals for a requirement that is part of the NRC's Financial Accounting and Integrated Management Information System (FAIMIS) business transformation initiative. This initiative allows the agency to achieve a consolidated enterprise financial management information system. This solicitation will include the purchase of enterprise-wide commercial software licenses for a CGI Momentum&reg; Acquisitions module (brand name or equal) that will become a part of the existing CGI Momentum-based FAIMIS system as well as services required to implement that brand name or equal acquisitions module into FAIMIS. <br />Background:</p>
<p>On October 1, 2010, the NRC implemented a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software product, CGI's Momentum&reg; (hereafter referred to as "Momentum&reg;") for its Core Financial System (CFS), known at the NRC as the FAIMIS CFS. The FAIMIS CFS includes the following modules: Budget Execution, Purchasing, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Purchase Card, General Ledger, Travel Accounting, Fixed Assets, License Fee Billing, and Cost Accounting. NRC's implementation of Momentum&reg; enabled it to replace multiple legacy stand-alone financial systems, including the legacy Federal Financial System (FFS), which was no longer compliant with Federal standards for financial systems. Overall, the NRC's implementation of Momentum as part of the FAIMIS CFS achieved the following: <br /><br />-Introduced the functional capability to meet current and future NRC financial -reporting requirements through a federally compliant, integrated, user friendly, transparent and efficient COTS system. <br /><br />-Enabled the mitigation of risk of error and ability to maintain effectiveness through consolidation of functionality and processes provided by five, outdated legacy systems and custom solutions developed organically over time. The FAIMIS CFS replaced the Federal Financial System (FFS), the License Fee Billing System (FEES), the Cost Accounting System (CAS), the Advice of Allowance and Financial Plans (AAFP) Spreadsheets and the Capitalized Property System (CPS).<br /><br />-Enabled completion of the first phase of the NRC's vision for an integrated and consolidated enterprise-wide financial management system.<br /><br />-Provided numerous interfaces, one specific FAIMIS CFS interface is an important part of the acquisitions process. FAIMIS CFS interfaces with United States Treasury systems for the disbursement and collections of funds and for debt management reporting, and with the Automated Standard Application for Payments (ASAP) Grant Management System for the management of grant obligations and payments.</p>
<p><br />There are currently approximately 600 users of the FAIMIS CFS. These users are primarily comprised of the agency's budget analysts and clerical and accounting staff from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) as well as the NRC program and regional offices. Most of these individuals are based at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. Approximately 20 additional FAIMIS CFS users from the Department of the Interior's National Business Center (DOI/NBC) in Denver, Colorado currently support processing of Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable and entering of obligations in FAIMIS CFS.</p>
<p>The selected commercial item acquisition solution will be integrated into CGI's Momentum&reg; federal financial management solution, NRC's FAIMIS CFS . An integrated FAIMIS acquisition solution will allow NRC to increase efficiency and improve the Agency's internal controls. Through the selected acquisitions solution, the NRC intends to create, store, and maintain documentation and complete transactions relating to commercial contracts, purchase orders, grants, Interagency Agreements (IAAs), cooperative agreements and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) lab agreements.</p>
<p>The acquisitions solution, once implemented, will standardize the finance and acquisitions processes performed by the NRC's Division of Contracts and program and regional offices within a single, transparent business solution. Standardized processes within a single business solution will facilitate increased visibility into financial and contracting practices that have grown organically over time across the NRC program offices. As a result, data integrity will be enhanced by replacing standalone acquisitions systems, custom solutions, spreadsheets and manual interfaces with a single business solution for which data requirements and definitions will be well defined and uniform.</p>
<p>Currently, the FAIMIS CFS is being hosted by the DOI/NBC. With the implementation of the acquisitions solution, the NRC will retain the hosting services of DOI/NBC for FAIMIS and expects the entire FAIMIS solution, including the acquisition solution, to be collocated within a single integrated environment at DOI/NBC. Additionally, the NRC currently pays for a per user licensing fee for FAIMIS CFS.<br /><br /><br />The Government intends to award a single contract to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable or better proposal is deemed to represent the best value to the Government, cost/price and other factors considered. More specific evaluation factors will be included in the solicitation. The contract will include a two-year base period from date of award (currently estimated to be April 2011), and one (1) six-month option to extend the term of the contract. NO PHONE CALLS RELATING TO THIS NOTICE WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments relating to this acquisition in writing to dominique.malone@nrc.gov, with a courtesy copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site for the release of the solicitation as it will be made available only on this website. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about December 27, 2010. Proposals are anticipated to be due on or about the response date listed in this notice. Potential offerors are strongly encouraged to check this website frequently for updated information (if any) relating to this acquisition. The anticipated award date is in the April 2011 timeframe.</p>
