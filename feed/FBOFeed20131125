<DESC>The objective of the Air Force Reasearch Laboratory (AFRL) Alternative Energy funding for FY13 is to accelerate the transition of energy efficiency and alternative energy technologies to meet Air Force and the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) Office of Operational Energy Plans and Programs energy goals. The Air Force has received FY13 Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E, 3600) funds for this purpose. The majority of this funding will be awarded to aviation fuel saving efforts at a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6, such that the technology would be mature enough for consideration in future major acquisition strategies after successful demonstration. A portion of this funding may go to ground based advanced power and alternative energy efforts that are at a TRL 6 or higher to show military utility and promote the need to transition into the USAF's inventory of ground vehicles, aerospace ground support equipment, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources, and base infrastructure - with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental responsibility.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) in relation to the procurement of hardware, software, and services for the&nbsp;NATO project:&nbsp;Provide Access Control and Threat Identification - Phase II.<br /><br />The U.S. Government must nominate potential U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list for this project.&nbsp; To be nominated, a U.S. prime contractor 1) must be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and 2) must&nbsp;hold a current&nbsp;facility security clearance at the level of SECRET.
<p>In addition, for performance of the contract, all contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold&nbsp;NATO SECRET personnel security clearances. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to NCIA the required NATO security clearance certifications.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-13684-OPL. It is planned to place a single contract for the entire scope of work. No partial bidding will be allowed.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>This high priority force-protection related procurement is in direct support of deployed NATO forces in the ISAF Theatre. This Contract represents the second phase of the Theatre Access Control and Threat Identification (TACTIC) project. Phase 1 delivered a full ID badge production and management capability, as well as a small access control capability. Phase 2 will deliver a full access control capability at four primary bases in ISAF. This will include electronic access control at exterior base entry and exit points, airport flight line entry/exit points, airport passenger terminals, and mobile reader capabilities. Additionally, Phase 2 will replace existing card stock with a contactless card stock with increased data storage. This will be used by the existing badge production equipment to produce enhanced capability badges that can interface with new Phase 2 electronic access control equipment.</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCIRD/ISD, 1600 Clifton Rd. NE, Mailstop A19, Atlanta, GA, 30333, hereby announces its intent to issue a sole source contract to GlaxoSmithKline 5 Moore Drive Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-0143 to increase the maximum dosage quantities of Infanrix, Pediarix, and Kinrix vaccines.
<p>NAICS Code: 325412</p>
<p>Period of Performance: 04/01/2013 to 03/31/2014</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i). CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices recommends that all children receive the DTaP series for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.  Currently, there are two vaccine manufacturers licensed to produce DTaP-containing vaccines in the US, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur.  Sanofi is not able to provide the needed vaccines so they need to be purchased from GSK and in order to do this, the maximum dosage quantities need to be increased for these three vaccines.</p>
<p><br />Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency for future procurement. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to Michael Harwell, Contracting Specialist, Reference 200-2013-54509, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: Michael Harwell, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>This is a posting of a sole source award to GlaxoSmithKline and is not a request for competition.</p>

</span><span>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. 503 days is the requested delivery. FOB origin with origin inspection and acceptance. All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: Goodrich (11599) and Boeing Company (76301). Based on Market Research this item is manufactured for military use only and is not commercial; therefore, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 in its solicitation for this item. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offers' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.<br /><br />QTY 125 <br /><br />price breaks <br /><br />50-99<br />100-149<br /></span>

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey / Request for Information for the purpose of soliciting statements of interest and capabilities from interested vendors.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a need for instructional services to support Air Traffic Controller (ATC) workforce training.  This requirement includes training support to the FAA Academy and approximately 300 FAA facilities nationwide.

The FAA has a continuous requirement for air traffic controller training to maintain a well-trained and fully-staffed ATC workforce.  This training is composed of classroom, laboratory/simulation and refresher training environments.  This requirement includes contractor augmentation of FAA resources planning and performing ATC training and training related services.   The FAA CTC requirement is intended to fulfill three critical FAA needs:

1.	Instructional and training services support to 200 to 300 FAA facilities nationwide.
2.	Nationwide availability of qualified ATC instructors.
3.	Workforce management of over 1,500 instructors and support staff.

The FAAâ€™s current acquisition strategy contemplates awarding a contract to supplement and augment FAA controller training capabilities. This Controller Training Contract (CTC) will provide the FAA with a flexible contract vehicle to provide qualified instructors for variable durations at locations and times determined by the FAA.  The goal for this contract is to meet all known FAA training needs while remaining flexible to increase or decrease the service level as required by workforce and budget constraints. Award of this competitive procurement is anticipated to be made as early as the Fall of 2014. 

Included as Attachment A to this announcement is the draft Statement of Work (SOW) for the CTC acquisition.  In order to ensure the forthcoming procurement provides the clearest possible understanding of the FAAâ€™s objectives, the FAA requests responses from industry which include the following:

Interested vendors must provide the following:
a.	Capability Statement (as defined below)
b.	Completed Business Declaration Form (Attachment B)
c.	Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form and/or proof of
service-disabled veteran-owned small business status (if applicable)
d.	OPTIONAL: Interested vendor listing data.  Interested vendors may complete and submit the attached (Attachment C) vendor data sheet for the purpose of publicly disclosing their interest in subcontracting / teaming arrangements for this potential opportunity.  The FAA will then publish this data at the time of the FAAâ€™s next update to this opportunity.  Inclusion in this interested vendor listing is not a requirement or in any way a precursor for consideration in a future solicitation based on this market survey.

Capability Statement:

Responses must provide a Capability Statement that
addresses the following 

1.	Describe your firmâ€™s ability to provide specialized training resources and training staff augmentation resources nationwide on short notice and with varying durations.
2.	Describe your firmâ€™s ability to provide flexible classroom training and simulation support in a residency academic environment such as the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City.
3.	Describe your firms understanding and experience with FAA Air Traffic Control training procedures and methods.  The contracts must demonstrate the capability to perform similar size, scope and complexity as the work indicated above and in Attachment A.  
4.	Performance Management: Describe a process to ensure successful performance of the contract requirements.
5.	The FAA encourages teaming arrangements.  Describe any use of subcontractors; a Joint Venture arrangement, affiliated offerors or an FAA approved Mentor ProtÃ©gÃ© arrangement to fulfill this requirement.

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.   The NAICS code for this requirement is 611430: Professional Development Training with a small business size standard of $10M

This market survey must not be construed as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these items.  The FAA will not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to the Market Survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding to this announcement.

One, some, all, or none of the respondents to the Market Survey/Request For Information may be requested to provide additional information at the option of the Government. No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise for future business with the FAA. Information obtained from this Market Survey will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for air traffic controller training 

The interested vendorâ€™s response must be submitted no later than 2:00 P.M. local time on December 23, 2013.  All responses to this Market Survey must be in writing, on company letterhead, limited to no more than 15 pages and include a completed Business Declaration Form (Attachment B).  The Business Declaration Form is not included in the page limit.   Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked. However, information from vendor submissions may be used in future acquisition activities on a non-vendor specific basis.  Submit any questions by email to the point-of-contact noted below with a carbon copy sent to Jane Christoff at jane.christoff@faa.gov no later than December 10, 2013.  Submit responses by overnight delivery or email to:

NOTES: Electronic submission is preferred. The electronic submission should be in either Microsoft Word format or portable document format (PDF).

<SUBJECT>Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots
<SOLNBR>N01CO42400-80
<CONTACT>Scott P. Keasey, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-846-1115, Email scott.keasey@nih.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to solicit proposals from sources to create Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots.</p>
<p>Current opinion in the scientific literature suggests that the cancer research community has a requirement for a Cancer Genomics Cloud to help meet their needs for storage, access to, and analysis of high quality, large-scale cancer genomic data and associated clinical information. A model recently articulated in a series of NCI Precision Medicine Workshops and publications by experts in the field of biomedical informatics involves the creation of a set of data repositories with co-located computational capacity and an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides security and resource access to developers of analytic tools. In this model, applications are brought to the data, rather than bringing the data to the applications.</p>
<p>Towards this end, the NCI seeks to sponsor the development of multiple Cancer Genomics Cloud pilots that will be available for use and testing by the scientific community as part of a competitive evaluation that will include technical benchmarking and cost analysis. The project expectation is the development of a new model for computational analysis of biological data that has the potential to address current storage and analysis challenges. The proposed Cancer Genomics Cloud will serve as a community platform for cancer genome integration and analysis. Such a Cancer Genomics Cloud has the potential to democratize access to NCI-generated genomic data and provide a more cost-effective way to provide computational support to the cancer research community. If successful, the NCI will consult with the community and relevant oversight committee(s) to define, and potentially construct, a production version of one or more of the pilot clouds, or a successor design informed by the results of the pilot evaluations. In spirit, and by design, this new initiative will be the first step toward a full Cancer Knowledge Commons, along the lines called for in the National Academy report on Precision Medicine. The project will be coordinated with The National Institutes of Health's Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative and other biomedical cloud activities.</p>
<p>The services will be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 518210 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). It is anticipated that up to three (3) cost-reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded with a six (6) month base period for the initial design and development, followed by a nine (9) month option period for completion of design, development, and implementation, and another nine (9) month option period for testing and evaluation. These awards are anticipated to begin on or about September 1, 2014.</p>
<p>The acquisition will contain Mandatory Criteria that must be met at time of proposal submission:</p>
<p>1. The prime contractor must have demonstrated capability in a biomedical research project involving at least 100 TB of data.<br />2. The prime contractor and/or the institution that is hosting the data must have the ability and commit to making these resources available to the community outside the hosting institution. This must include: (a) a minimum of 10 Gb/sec current connectivity from the commodity internet to the cloud infrastructure, with a capacity up to 40 Gb/sec; and (b) evidence from the hosting entity that the organization will allow access to the solution and that it will either support an existing, open authentication capability such as inCommon, or that they will provide the resources necessary to do remote identity proofing and credential distribution as per NIST Special Publication 800-63-1 for any community researcher that desires access to the cloud. Such provisioning must be accomplished within seven (7) days of receipt of necessary documents.<br />3. The prime contractor must meet the intellectual property requirements of the potential Broad Agency Announcement, as outlined in the Research and Technical Objectives.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent for the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to be available electronically on or about December 10, 2013 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE INTERNET SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>
<p>The Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots IdeaScale site which has been open since 08/01/2013 will be locked from additional input to coincide with the release of the anticipated Broad Agency Announcement on or about 12/10/2013. The site will remain open as a reference for potential offerors. The IdeaScale site was created to provide a collaborative and transparent way for the community to comment on important topics to The Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots. A Special Notice was posted to FedBizOpps on 08/01/2013 (<a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/RCB/HHS-NIH-NCI-RDSS-MOSB-2402-80/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/RCB/HHS-NIH-NCI-RDSS-MOSB-2402-80/listing.html</a>) to direct the public to NCI's IdeaScale site (<a href="http://ncicloud.ideascale.com/">http://ncicloud.ideascale.com/</a>).</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to host a Proposer's Day Conference on or about December 18, 2013 and may be accessed through WebEx. The full details for the Proposer's Day Conference will be attached to the forthcoming BAA which will be posted on FedBizOpps.</p>

<p><br />This is a Research and Development initiative. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, seek to make human brain tissue and biospecimen samples more widely available for research on neurological, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The objective of this initiative is to increase availability of human disease and control biospecimens, increase proactive involvement of the disease advocacy and patient communities, and more efficiently acquire, curate, store, and distribute these tissues with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of nervous system disorders.</p>
<p>In order to do so, the NIH intends to establish multiple contract collection sites (i.e., the NIH Brain and Tissue Repositories (NBTR)) to provide services that will actively acquire, receive, process, store, curate, preserve, and distribute central nervous system and related biological specimens (including fetal tissues) to qualified investigators. These services were previously provided through grants that have expired and/or will be expiring in the coming year. The NIH will now continue these existing services through competitively awarded contracts. New sources are also encouraged to compete. The NIH now funds these services through competitively awarded contracts. This is the second solicitation of the Neurobiobank and builds on Requests for Proposals issued in FY 2013 for contract awards in FY2013.</p>
<p>All qualified organizations are encouraged to respond with a proposal.</p>
<p>The original small business sources sought synopsis for this initiative (HHS-NIH- NIMH-SBSS-13-273 was posted on June 20, 2013.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Acquisition Management in Washington, D.C. intends to establish a sole source Blanket Purchase Agreement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, for the acquisition of Illumina, Inc. enzymes, chemical reagents, reaction mixes and testing kits. The equipment to be offered under this BPA will support the Illumina sequencing instrument MiSeq System previously purchased under Order #EP-12-W-000116. The Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) located in Cincinnati, OH has ongoing research that requires numerous products (see attachment).  Agency scientists have designed numerous techniques and methods using this vendor?s products.  Using the Illumina?s products will provide consistency, thus maintaining the integrity and validity of the scientific methods.  If other vendor?s products were used, they would have to evaluate and re-optimize Agency techniques which would result in a waste of significant resources, both funding and time. No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement. Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the EPA requirements described herein may submit a response; which, if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be reviewed for consideration. Responses to this posting must be submitted in writing via e-mail only. A determination not to compete the described requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Federal Government. Any questions or comments should be directed via e-mail ONLY to Frank Bottalico at Bottalico.Frank@epa.gov. Details regarding this action may also be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm  Thank you for your interest.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Center - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), and Project Manager Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (PM WIN-T) are conducting market research.  The purpose is to identify parties interested in performing as the prime contractor for the following effort: <br>  <br> PM WIN-T Increment 3 anticipates a follow on to the original System Development contract awarded in 2002.  This effort reflects the continued development of the WIN-T Increment 3 System to include, but not limited to, network and transmission engineering, logistics support, software development and support and test.  WIN-T is the implementation of the Army's strategy to achieve a world-class Joint expeditionary network enabled by information technologies that support the goals of the Army Campaign Plan and other Army/Joint mandates. WIN-T is an Acquisition Category 1D Major Defense Acquisition Program that establishes a single integrating framework creating a network of networks for the Army, operating at the halt and on the move.  WIN-T Increment 3 provides the fully mobile, flexible, dynamic tactical networking capability needed to support a highly dispersed force over a noncontiguous area. WIN-T Increment 3 enhances network capability and reliability and introduces the aerial tier.  <br>  <br> The focus of WIN-T Increment 3 Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) is to attain Milestone C approval.

<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Opportunity: <br />Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS) under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to collaborate with LLNL and license intellectual property rights to pilot, deploy and commercialize LLNL's NeMS: Network Mapping System.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Background:<br />Network security is a significant need in today's interconnected electronic environment.&nbsp; With the rising adoption of cloud computing and virtualization, as well as the growing use of wireless and mobile devices for corporate business, organizations' networks are becoming increasingly complex and distributed.&nbsp; At the same time, organizations are facing ever-increasing complex security threats.&nbsp; To protect their network's integrity and availability, many organizations have invested heavily in security staff and technologies designed to identify, analyze and protect their computing infrastructure and network connections.&nbsp; Network mapping technologies can provide critical information about the organization's network to the personnel tasked with monitoring and protecting the network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has developed network characterization and discovery tool called NeMS to address the problem of mapping Internet Protocol (IP) networks.&nbsp; The tool can help users achieve network situational awareness without requiring extensive network preparation or prior information and without compromising the security posture of the mapped network.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Description:<br />LLNL's NeMS system enables network mapping operations by using two LLNL-developed software systems: LLNL's NeMS tool and the Everest visualization system.&nbsp; Each software system can be also used separately for their specific applications.&nbsp; When the two systems are used together as an iterative analysis platform, LLNL's NeMS system provides network security managers and information technology personnel with continuing network situational awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">The LLNL's NeMS tool is a software-based network characterization and discovery application. The LLNL's NeMS strives to produce a comprehensive representation of IP-based computer network environments. The LLNL's NeMS supports actionable intelligence and meaningful decision making by providing a view of the actual state of a computer network environment.&nbsp; Data discovered by the system can be stored, processed, viewed and analyzed by the appropriate information technology and security personnel.&nbsp; The final result of running LLNL's NeMS is a map of the target network environment.&nbsp; The LLNL's NeMS is designed and configurable to minimize disruptions and impacts on the target operational network and to require minimal intervention by network security staff. Similarly, LLNL's NeMS is designed to reduce the potential for overburdening the target network and should not affect the usability of the network services.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">LLNL's Everest visualization system is a software tool for advanced graph visualization and analysis.&nbsp; Everest enables analysts to rapidly search, integrate, and gain insight from information that is stored in a variety of forms in pre-existing data sources.&nbsp; Everest's approach to modeling information allows new relations to be discerned in ways that aren't possible with traditional relational query techniques.&nbsp; For network security personnel, Everest enables users to view, search, and analyze the data from LLNL's NeMS or data fused to overlay logical network maps from LLNL's NeMS onto other information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Advantages:<br />LLNL's NeMS: <br />* Creates a scalable, detailed map of the target network environment<br />* Preserves the security posture of the mapped network <br />* Requires very little preparation or pre-existing understanding of the network<br />* Can be utilized from outside a firewall, or from one or more vantage points within a network<br />* Enables users to quickly query details of network entities, attributes, roles, and logical relationships<br />* Can automatically discover network features during mapping<br />* Can intelligently control its own operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Potential Applications:<br />LLNL's NeMS system can be used to generate a new network map of an IP network, corroborate or update existing network maps, or overlay logical network maps onto other information.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Development Status: <br />LLNL's NeMS has been demonstrated on Class B networks (2 million IPs) and can be scaled up to Class A networks (&gt;16 million IPs).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">Commercial Opportunity:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0pt; mso-add-space: auto;">NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.</p>

No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this notice, or the Government use of any information provided. The Government does not guarantee any action beyond this notice.</p>
<p>Information provided in response to this notice will be used by the U. S. Department of State (DOS) in developing its acquisition strategy, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>(a)	Requirements definition and determination of commercial availability;<br />(b)	Socio-economic set-aside decisions;<br />(c)	Potential use of existing government-wide contract vehicles;<br />(d)	Contract Line Item/Pricing structure;<br />(e)	Identification of the applicable Section 508 accessibility standards (see 36 CFR 1194) that can or cannot be met by supplies that are available in the commercial marketplace in time to meet the agency's delivery requirements.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this notice.  DOS is requesting industry feedback on its ability to provide supplies based on the requirements described herein.</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State (DOS) Global Publishing Solutions (GPS) manages approximately 1,200 office copiers that handle the needs of 80% of all the DOS bureaus and offices within the continental U.S.  Currently, 90% of the copiers are located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with the remaining 10% of copiers located in field offices throughout the U.S.  GPS is requesting sources who can meet the requirements of the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). Respondents are cautioned that this Statement of Work is a draft only, does not represent a current solicitation, and may be changed significantly in any potential future solicitation.</p>
<p><br /><strong>RESPONSE CONTENT AND FORMAT</strong></p>
<p>(a)	The Government is not interested in marketing responses and such generic documents will not be considered by the Department. Only responses meeting these specific instructions shall be included in the Department's market research analysis.</p>
<p>(b)	Failure to comply with any of these instructions may result in removal of the response from the Department's market research analysis. The Department is under no obligation to request clarification or additional information not provided in the initial response.</p>
<p>(c)	Responses must identify the respondent company name, DUNS Number, CAGE Code, complete street address, Point of Contact (POC) First and Last Name, POC Telephone Number, and POC Email address.</p>
<p>(d)	 Responses must identify the brand name(s) and example model numbers of copiers, supplies, toner, consumables, etc. the respondent can provide that would meet the requirements of the draft SOW.

<DESC>This Presolicitation Notice is to announce that the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is proposing to negotiate a contract with The University of Missouri, on a sole-source basis, for various services and include a base year and 4 option years.  The USGS has concluded that these services are unique and only available from The University of Missouri.  The reasons justifying this lack of competition is based on the following description of specific qualifications the Government requires of the  services to meet its minimum need, and the factors the Government will use to evaluate the service information submitted by firms in response to this Notice:
USGS has a need to obtain a wide array of high level expertise administrative and support/scientific services. The services must be well matched to the research being conducted by USGS, must be in close proximity to Columbia, MO to allow for easy interaction and all services and research must be in one location. Closeness will ensure that samples that are time and or temperature sensitive will not be jeopardized. 
The specific qualifications/capabilities for this requirement include:
(1) Repair services to various scientific and facilities equipment
(2) Custom fabrication services to construct various scientific equipment per formalized specifications

<DESC>RFI for Database, Middleware, and Maintenance Support for existing specified products
This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary.  All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.
VA is issuing this RFI to seek comprehensive integrated software solutions that exist today that can meet the requirements identified below for over 600 enterprise databases, over 1,000 middleware installations, supporting a workforce of more than 600,000 users (including employees, volunteers and contactors) and millions of veterans and family members who utilize VA information technology (IT) solutions for medical care and benefits processing.  VA already has a comprehensive Oracle solution in place, which operates on Linux, Solaris, HP-UX/AIX, UNIX and IBM Operating Systems, that already provides this integrated solution.  This solution provides a seamless interoperability between legacy systems and new systems running on VA Infrastructure.  
VA has an extensive investment in the Oracle product suite and extensive experience with that technology.  VA's desire at this time is not to replace the Oracle investment but to assess the current marketplace for an alternative to augment and expand the comprehensive, seamless integrated environment provided by the Oracle products currently in place.  Manufacturers that provide a seamless integrated solution equal to or greater than the environment provided by Oracle, of the same size and scope that is currently operating within VA, are requested to provide a description of that product set and provide examples of that environment currently operating in implementations of the same size and scope.  VA is focused on determining if the proposed implementations are of the same size and scope, provide the same level of seamless integration, and are as comprehensive as that currently operating and available to VA from Oracle.  More specifically, is the solution proposed, equal to or greater than the capabilities of that provided by the Oracle solution operating within VA and is that comprehensive solution successfully deployed and fully operational to the same levels as VA in a seamless integrated environment of the same size and scope as VA.

At present, VA intends to continue to maintain, operate, augment, update, upgrade and expand as necessary, the current solution to support our mission.  VA operates 360,000 workstations and 24,000 servers to provide a broad range of IT capabilities to every user across the agency.  VA holds perpetual licenses for a significant number of Oracle products that operate on these systems (e.g. Database, WebLogic, Primavera, and others). 

VA seeks to assess the current IT marketplace to understand the seamless integrated capabilities that meet or exceed Oracle capabilities currently operating within VA.  The entire solution must provide security that meets FIPS 140-2 and be fully compliant with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act.  It must also provide capabilities equal to or greater than those provided by Oracle for persistent data protection and prevention of loss of data. 
For new database deployments, VA requires a seamless and integrated enterprise database environment that is interoperable with existing VA Oracle database installations.  Oracle database products are currently utilized for critical tasks throughout VA, such as claims processing, clinician collaboration, provision of patient care, Veteran medical records data entry, secure transmission of patient data, and real-time access to patient data by clinicians and patients.  The solution must have no negative impact on the performance or availability of any existing VA applications utilizing the Oracle database product. 
For new middleware deployments, VA requires a seamless and integrated enterprise middleware solution that is interoperable with existing VA Oracle WebLogic applications.  Oracle WebLogic products are currently utilized for critical tasks throughout VA, such as claims processing, clinician collaboration, provision of patient care, Veteran medical records data entry, secure transmission of patient data, and real-time access to patient data by clinicians and patients.  The solution must have no negative impact on the performance or availability of any existing VA applications utilizing Oracle WebLogic products. 
VA requires a seamless and integrated enterprise solution that is compatible with and runs on Linux, Solaris, HP-UX/AIX, UNIX and IBM Operating Systems. 
For existing database and middleware deployments, VA requires a solution that allows for the purchase of maintenance for Oracle software products already owned by and deployed throughout VA (see Attachment A).
Each response shall include an answer to the following questions: 
1.	Do you currently have an implementation of a comprehensive, seamlessly integrated solution that provides at least the same capabilities as described above?
2.	For solutions that meet the above criteria, provide the following:

a.	A brief description of the overall solution and a brief description of the environment and infrastructure in which this solution currently operates.
b.	Identify the entity currently operating the entire solution in a single, seamlessly integrated manner.
c.	Identify all specific products used in the solution and the functions they perform.
d.	Briefly describe how the integration between modules is performed and how that integration is managed when new versions of individual products are introduced. 
e.	Discuss risk mitigation management and strategies used to eliminate risks associated with integration of products used in the solution that are provided by multiple vendors, especially related to those risks introduced when individual products are upgraded.
f.	Provide an estimate of the approximate cost expended by the entity currently operating this solution to implement that solution and the estimated annual cost to maintain that solution.
Responses to this RFI shall be submitted via email to Contract Specialist Kimberly Flynn at Kimberly.Flynn1@va.gov no later than 12:00 noon EST on December 6, 2013.  Product information, brochures, part numbers, and/or other description information may be included with the submission.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to remove "glazed from both NSN Names and to reduce the box count from 1,000 to 500 for NSN 7350-00-290-0594.  All other information remains the same from the original Notice.
<p>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.</p>
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7350-00-290-0593<br />Name:		Plate, Paper, White, Round, 6-1/2" Diameter<br />Description:	6-1/2" round x 1/2" deep un-compartmented paper plate made of molded pulp paper. Disposable plate is water and grease-resistant. Flat-bottom, nesting design. UOI is BX. BX = 1,000 plates per box.</p>
<p>NSN:		7350-00-290-0594<br />Name:		Plate, Paper, White, Round, 9" Diameter<br />Description:	9" round x 3/4" deep un-compartmented paper plate made of molded pulp paper. Disposable plate is water and grease-resistant. Flat-bottom, nesting design. UOI is BX. BX = 500 plates per box.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7350-00-290-0593<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	HTMVACATECT; M217719; HUHPocket; 901-UX7WS/UX7WS; HUHPAPRO; SXP6PATH</p>
<p>NSN:			7350-00-290-0594<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	290-0594; HTMVESSELCT; SPM6713183906 / SCCHP9SSYM; UX9PATH</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 19, 2013 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 6,Hampton Medical Center, National Chaplain Center plans to contract by means  of other than full and open competition for purchase request number 590-14-1-424-0001

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The purpose of this memorandum is to document justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition by the National Veterans Chaplain Center Hampton, VA for training for rural clergy pertaining to the emotional and spiritual needs of Veterans returning from OIF/OEF/OND. This action will be awarded as a firm-fixed price sole-source procurement for Rural Clergy Training. (Ligon-Forrest and Associates LLC)  The contract is to be awarded as a base contract and one year option. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  This is a non-personnel services contract to plan and perform training for rural clergy during FY 2014 as an addition to training that was performed in FY 2013 under the title of: "Rural Health Initiative Expansion.  The service is for rural community clergy who can support and serve Veterans and National Guard and Reserve personnel. The training will be at the National VA Chaplain Center in Hampton Virginia.  The Government shall not exercise any supervision or control over the contract, however; the contractor will collaborate with the National Chaplain Center staff, other VHA health care professional and corporate entities. Services provided under the terms of this contract shall be licensed to meet State and local government laws and procedures.  Period of performance is 12/15/2013 through December 15, 2014.  The estimated value of the contract is $99,592.00. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC Â§253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Delay in award would result in a gap in training, the work must be completed within FY 2014

	(x )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Ligon-Forrest and Associates LLC is established by Dr. James Goalder.  Dr. Goalder has served as the Rural Clergy Training Program Coordinator since 2011.  We are requesting that his services ( in this same capacity) be maintained during FY14, and possibly extended to FY15.  Dr. Goalder served as a staff psychologist at the Hampton VAMC for 20 years and specialized in treating Veterans with PTSD.  He also taught classes of chaplains (clergy) at the National Chaplain Center for over 8 years. Additionally, he has experience providing adult learning events for clergy, professionals and Veterans. Because of Dr. Goalder's experience (especially his previous two years serving in the position), Ligon- Forrest and Associates LLC has the unique qualification to provide training to community clergy who will be serving returning Veterans in rural areas.  Dr. Goalder has the specialized requirements to perform this work.  He has the knowledge of the emotional and spiritual needs of Veterans who have suffered physical, emotional or psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and traumatic brain injury, symptoms of combat stress, depression and risk for suicide. This requirement was not synopsized in the Fedbizopps pursuant to the exception in FAR 2.202(a) (11). 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Under the authority of Title 41 U.S.C. 254(1) and FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i) other than full and open competition is justified when supplies are deemed available from only the original source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  The contract for this requirement must be in possession of the skills to provide education and training to rural clergy policy on the provision of spiritual and pastoral care as outlined in VA policy.  The contractor must be a trained psychologist, experienced in assessing and treating veterans with combat-related Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury, symptoms of combat stress, depression and risk for suicide and delivering a curriculum based program to rural clergy on the recognition of Veteran related psychological disorders.  The intent to award sole source notice will be posted to FBO as require4d by Subpart 5.2. It is imperative that the vendor be familiar with the Educating Rural Clergy to Recognize & Respond to Veterans Healthcare Needs initiative and the unique needs of veterans returning with psychological disorders.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Current contract prices on contract VA246-13-C-0020 were determined to be fair and reasonable prior to contract award base upon historical data. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  :  As described in Section 6 above, market research in accordance with FAR Part 10,, was conducted by synopsis of the proposed acquisition, advising industry of the pending acquisition and soliciting  inquiries from interested parties.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The nationally-funded project cannot be completed without the services of Dr. Goalder.  The work must be completed within FY 2014.  Delay in awarding the contract, or an attempt to award the contract to an unqualified individual will result in failure of the project to meet its goals.   Information important to serving returning Veterans in rural areas will not reach the community clergy, who are a vital link to these Veterans.   

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None, because Ligon- Forrest and Associates LLC is the only known company with and established relationship with the training program in question. 

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  As there are no other available sources, there are no actions to be taken to overcome barriers to competition.


12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<SOLNBR>SOL-OAA-14-000025
<RESPDATE>010314
<CONTACT>MENA II Initiative RFI, Email cpowers@usaid.gov
<DESC><strong>Background</strong><br />USAID is introducing the Middle East North Africa Investment Initiative (MENAII). MENAII will provide needed support to early stage businesses in order to create and sustain jobs, advance and develop the investment eco-system and encourage increased equity investment in early stage businesses.
<p>In order to achieve this, USAID grantee will partner with qualified members of the early stage private sector investment community, ranging from Incubators/Accelerators to Angels to Venture Capital in the Middle East region by providing: 1) Matching Investment Capital; 2) 100% Cash Collateralized Insurances, and; 3) Technical Assistance. <br /> <br />These lines of effort will result in reflows, or program income, that will make MENAII a sustainable endeavor allowing for continued support to early stage businesses. Qualified partners will invest with an expectation of return on investment as a result from positive operational results and are expected to devote considerable effort to better governance, strategic guidance, market-linkages, and continuous mentoring. All of these factors produce a natural alignment of USAID's development goals and qualified partners' goals of sustainably and profitably growing businesses.</p>
<p><strong>Matching Grant Capital</strong><br />By matching private sector investment capital, MENAII will ease fundraising for qualified investors and increase calculated deployment of investment capital.  The resulting reduction of private sector exposure will thereby contract the funding gap in early stage businesses. Additionally, qualified partners will be enabled to scale successful investment strategies and continue to invest in early stage businesses.</p>
<p><strong>100% Cash Collateral Insurances</strong><br />MENAII will incentivize private sector investment by providing qualified partners with partial insurances on investments in early stage businesses. 100% Cash Collateralized Insurances will mitigate some of the risk associated with investing in early stage businesses and thereby encourage increased investment.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Assistance</strong><br />MENAII will provide technical assistance to improve both investors and investment recipients. Potential areas of assistance include: investment management; business development services, processes, marketing, branding; product design, research and development; and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Submitting Responses/Comments</strong><br />Responses may be submitted within the body of the email or as an attachment.</p>
<p>Responses must include the following information:<br />&bull;	Organization name and address;  <br />&bull;	Organization point of contact name, telephone number, and email address;<br />&bull;	Descriptive and current list of country presence in MENA region</p>
<p>In addition to general comments and suggestions, we are requesting specific comments to the following:<br />&bull;	Based on your experience, what is the best way to employ the aforementioned tools to effectively develop a support eco-system for early stage businesses?<br />&bull;	What familiarity does your organization have with the current dynamics of this market, from either an investment capital supply or business demand perspective?<br />&bull;	What is your organization's current capacity to facilitate and manage the three components of MENAII?</p>
<p><strong>Submit responses to this RFI to cpowers@usaid.gov no later than the time/date stated above. The subject line should state MENA II Initiative RFI.</strong></p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>5352.201-9101 Ombudsman <br />i. An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Lt Col Tonney Kaw-uh, (757) 574-5372, 129 Andrews St. Langley AFB, VA, tonney.kawuh@langley.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />ii. The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />iii. Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>Wide-Area Work Flow (WAWF) Instructions<br />2. All vendors/contractors must utilize the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system for certification and payment of invoices. Please note that various codes need to be identified on the contract award document (SF 1449) before entering data in the WAWF system. These codes function like zip codes and will route our invoice to the proper destinations for certification and payment. The following is a summary of the codes, (DoDAAC is Department of Defense Activity Address Code).</p>
<p>a. CAGE Code - identifies contractor information (may be found in block 17a)<br />b. Admin/Issued By DoDAAC: FA4800 - identifies the administering Contracting Office - ACC CONS (may be found in block 9, "Issued by"). <br />c. Inspected By/Ship To/Deliver To DoDAAC: F2Q365 - identifies Inspected By &amp; Ship To &amp; Delivery To DoDAACs. Leave the EXT block blank.<br />d. Pay DoDAAC: F67100 - identifies paying office, DFAS Limestone (may be found in block 18(a), "Payment will be made by").</p>
<p>3. The WAWF system will ask for additional information not previously required for invoicing which includes:</p>
<p>a. Inspection/Acceptance Points on the "Create New Document Screen" in WAWF: Mark D for Destination in both Inspection and Acceptance.<br />b. Shipment Number/Shipment Date: In WAWF under the "Header" tab of the Create New Document Screen you will find a shipment number and shipment date block. We recommend the shipment number entered be sequential beginning with each fiscal year (i.e. invoice for Oct would be shipment 1, invoice for Nov would be shipment 2, and so on) and shipment date may be date of invoice.<br />c. Stock Number: Type N/A in this space<br />d. Type: FT (for commodities), SVS (for services), etc</p>
<p>4. Contractors must prepare a combination invoice/receiving report electronically in WAWF. This will enable the invoice to be routed to DFAS at the same time the receiving report is routed to the customer (ACC DP), or as stated in the order for certification.</p>
<p>5. Invoices for cost reimbursable CLINS (i.e. Travel Costs) may also be submitted via WAWF, however, supporting documentation to validate costs billed must be electronically sent to 633 CONS/LGCZ and customer stated in Delivery Order.</p>
<p>6. 633 CONS/LGCZ will continue to serve as the liaison for payment issues. While we will no longer approve invoices, we will be able to monitor payment actions. Any questions regarding WAWF should first be directed to the Contract Manager or Contracting Officer to be resolved.</p>
<p>7. Contractor shall submit an email notification to the contract manager once an invoice/receiving report has been put into WAWF so that he/she can monitor payment action. After you have completed processing the invoice within WAWF you will be taken to a screen showing who is receiving email notification from WAWF. On this screen you will see a line stating Add Additional Email Notification. This allows you the opportunity to type in an email address. Once you have typed this address the persons name will stay with the contract until completion so you will not have to retype this name each time you input a new invoice. This person will receive an email notification each time you input an invoice against this contract.</p>

<DESC>NOTE: This announcement replaces BAA-RQKS-2014-002 in its entirety.
<p><br />The overall goal of the CERFER Program is to advance RF sensing technology with novel hardware, software and algorithmic approaches for agile and flexible sensing which bring to bear all available resources (e.g., spatial diversity, waveform diversity, transmit and receive adaptivity, signals of opportunity, etc.,) to maximize exploitation performance. Specifically, the goal is to address problems of concurrent detection, tracking, imaging, and classification/identification of targets within contested and challenging environments with single and distributed sensing architectures. This will include the development of models, hardware, software, algorithms and techniques spanning basic, applied and advanced research for both active and passive sensing. <br /><br />In order to achieve the objectives of this effort, advances in sensor subsystems will be required. In particular, attention to the areas of hardware, software and algorithm solutions to detect, track, image and identify targets within contested areas. This includes exploiting passive/active signals in a single or distributed architecture. Methods for measurements and validation will also be needed to verify any improvement. Modeling will also be used in these efforts. <br /><br />The contractor will be expected to deliver all software and/or hardware as required, and all associated data developed and/or used in the execution of this effort, unless clearly stated otherwise in the proposal.</p>

<p>(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>

<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. <BR> <BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated. ?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?	Where to file: An agency protest may be filed with either the contracting officer or to HQAMC. o	Protest to HQAMC shall be filed at: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension. ?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect. <BR> <BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2014008-KDB. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Library of Medicine intends to procure services for the integration, analysis, and development of chemical structure data and software with the ChemIDplus database system for the Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM).

<p>It is anticipated that ONE AWARD will be made from this solicitation. This requirement is for a base year with options for two (2) successive one year periods. The period of performance will begin on or about December 20, 2013.<br /><br /><strong>TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS</strong></p>
<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration in the award of the purchase order; however, price is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are significantly more important than price. The Government can make tradeoffs among price and technical factors in determining which Quoter offers the best value by awarding to other than the lowest price Quoter or other than the highest technically rated Quoter. Quoters are advised that award will be made to that Quoter whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</strong></p>
<p>In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall price alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation processes:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Technical Evaluation Criteria</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>A. Technical Approach (45 points)</strong></em></p>

Also, importance will be placed on the ability to assist web developers with complex code related to chemical structure data within the database. A sound technical approach must include a quality control plan for data submitted to NLM.</p>
<p><em><strong>B. Organization, Personnel, Facilities, Resources (20 points)<br /><br /></strong></em>This criterion will be evaluated based on the organization's description of the organization, personnel, facilities, and resources. Adequate personnel and resources must be outlined to demonstrate the ability to carry out the requirements of the technical approach. An advanced degree in chemistry toxicology or a closely related field of science is required.</p>
<p><em><strong>C. Chemical database support experience and past performance (35 points)<br /><br /></strong></em>This criterion will be evaluated based on demonstrated past experience providing professional services in support of a chemical database that included chemical structures and related identifiers such as the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) and InChI strings and keys. Past experience must include assisting with complex chemical structure code and work with the following software and technologies: Oracle, AccelrysDirect, JDraw, JSDraw, JMol, CHIME, and XML, molfiles and SDfiles, and other software applications related to the support and maintenance of a chemical structure database that includes 2D and 3D structures.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Intermittent, Worldwide</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity.  Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor (Worldwide) position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations oversight and management in the field to provide ad hoc support for assessments, new country start-ups, and program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The Personal Services Contractor (PSC) employee will also be involved in strategic design of various OTI country programs and the development of management products for OTI based on lessons learned.  The incumbent is considered an expert in the field of political transition programming overseas.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Advisor position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed.  As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Transition Advisor requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of DCHA systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation.  The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  She or he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.  The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Senior Transition Advisor is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Chief, Field Programs Division (FPD) or designee, the Senior Transition Advisor will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in the field and in Washington, DC including the provision of ad hoc support to new OTI country program start-ups and on-call technical assistance;</p>

<p>&bull;	Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing   justification documentation when necessary;</p>

<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all field staff adhere to security restrictions;</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Independently plan, design, and monitor OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist with the development of information management products and improved business practices for OTI based on research and personal field experience lessons learned;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials.</p>
<p>&bull;	Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull;	Negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee,  program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Extreme care and attention should be given to ensure that all necessary items are included in the proposal.   <br>    <br>  L.1.1 CLAUSE FILL-INS:   Some clauses require the offeror to fill in information. Pay particular attention to 52.247-60 GUARANTEED SHIPPING CHARACTERISTICS and 52.246-4028 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE POINTS: ORIGIN as that information will be used by the Government to calculate transportation costs.  A completed copy of clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, must be included with your proposal.  <br>    <br>  L.2 TECHNICAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE (TIQ):  The offeror shall complete each section of the TIQ (Attachment 0002).  Failure to complete every section of the TIQ may render your offer ineligible for award.   <br>    <br>  L.2.1 ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CAPABILITY INFORMATION: In addition to completing the TIQ regarding the Ambulance being proposed, the offeror shall support its responses by electronically submitting supporting documentation where indicated on the TIQ.    <br>    <br>  L.3 CLIN STRUCTURE and PRICE INFORMATION: The offeror shall legibly fill-in, in U.S. Dollars, the Unit Price column and the total Amount column for all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA on Attachment 0003 and Spare Parts Lists in Attachment 0004.  <br>    <br>  SECTION-M EVALUATION:  <br>    <br>  M.1 BASIS Of AWARD:  The Government will award a single Firm-Fixed-Price contract for an ambulance to the responsible offeror that is assessed as Acceptable in the Technical Capability Factor with the Lowest Total Evaluated Price.   <br>    <br>  M.1.2 EVALUATION:  The evaluation will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.6 ( quote mark Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items quote mark ).  There are two factors:  (1) Price and (2) Technical Capability.  The Government intends to conduct a price evaluation, to include transportation costs, on all proposals.  The Government will then conduct a technical capability review of the lowest total evaluated price proposal.  If the lowest price proposal is determined to be Unacceptable, then the Government will conduct a technical capability review on the next lowest price proposal.  Unless the Government determines it is in its best interests to conduct discussions, the Government will follow this process until the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal is identified.       <br>    <br>  M.1.3 TECHNICAL CAPABILITY FACTOR:  For an offeror to be eligible for award, its proposal must be assessed as Acceptable under each section of the Technical Information Questionnaire (TIQ) (Attachment 002).  Offerors found to be Unacceptable under any section of the TIQ will not be considered for award.  To determine Acceptability,   <br>    <br>  (1)	the Offeror's response must indicate it can meet each requirement on the TIQ; and  <br>    <br>  (2)	where supporting documentation is required, the Government will review the information submitted to confirm that the Offeror is capable of meeting the requirement.   <br>    <br>  An Acceptable proposal is one which clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.  An Unacceptable proposal is one which does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>    <br>  M.1.4 PRICE FACTOR:  The information submitted in response to Section L.3 will be evaluated to assess the reasonableness of the offeror's total evaluated price.  A price is considered reasonable if it does not exceed what would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business.    The total evaluated price will consist of the total sum of all CLIN numbers 0001AA - 0003AA and the transportation costs as determined by the ACC-Warren Transportation Office for all FOB origin CLINs (base only).  <br>    <br>  M.1.5 DISCUSSIONS:  In accordance with FAR clause 52.212-1(g), the Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical capability standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  In addition, the Government reserves the right, without entering discussions, to request additional information necessary to support the offeror's price in order to determine price reasonableness.  <br>    <br>  Offers are due no later than 2 December 2013, 1600 local time Warren, MI. Quotations must be submitted electronically Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI).  No phone calls will be accepted.    <br>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  <br>    <br>  	HQ Army Materiel Command	  <br>  	Office of Command Counsel  <br>  	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401  <br>  	Ft.

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Chad.B.Davis@uscg.mil. Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 1200 Pacific Time on 11/29/ 2013</p>

<DESC><p>The USAF Theatre Battle Control Division has issued a solicitation for contract award on a limited competition basis for the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) system. The 3DELRR Program is intended to produce and field the radar system for the United States Air Force (USAF) that meets the Service's theater battle space awareness needs in the current and forecasted threat environment. 3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS). It will replace the legacy USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system as the TPS-75 is incapable of detecting some current and emerging threats. <br /><br />The Government intends to award a contract following a modified&nbsp;competitive best value source selection based on written proposals limited to the incumbent prime contractors for the Pre-EMD phase of the 3DELRR program: Lockheed Martin Corporation; Raytheon Company; and Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation. The Government has determined to limit competition in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 6.302 (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)); Only a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Pre-EMD contractors have developed prototype 3DELRR systems through Preliminary Design Review. Other contractors would require additional development costs which could not be recouped by the Government through full and open competition. A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action will be posted to FedBizOps within 15 days of contract award. <br /><br />CHANGE IN SOLICITATION NUMBER<br /><br />Previous postings to FebBizOps concerning this acquisition; special notices, draft Request for Proposal documents, and other information have been posted under solicitation number R2278.&nbsp; In accordance with DFAR Supplement Part 204.70 - Uniform Procurement Instrument Identification Numbers, this acquistion has been assigned a procurement instrument identification number (PIIN) of FA8730-13-R-0001.&nbsp; All subsequent postings concerning this action will use this PIIN as a solicitation number.<br /><br />Postings and documents under number R2278 have been archived under this number and may be accessed through FedBizOps archives.</p>

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.<br /><br />13. Also note that, if this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>

<p>The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 11/25/2013</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved sources are: PARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION, CAGE 84561</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Restricted Rights Data Restrictions apply.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: UNRESTRICTED</p>
<p>PREP FOR DELIVERY</p>
<p>PKGING DATA - QUP 001:<br />SHALL BE PACKAGED STANDARD COMMERCIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASTM D 3951</p>
<p>For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,<br />which includes either Depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-<br />Direct) shipments, both DoD linear and two-dimensional (2D)bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the requirement for MSL and 2D symbols). See the DLA packaging web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply. 2D bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3) and DoD 4500.9-R. MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388. Shipping label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002. Bar code print quality shall meet ANSI MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000) for applicable 2D and/or linear bar codes. All DVD shipments shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD 52.211-9010(C). Except for the Transportation Control Number (TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the fIeld is not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be left blank. If there are inconsistencies between the schedule and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publically disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publically for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be publically disclosed, including to other offerors, during the reverse auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to modify the award on an other than full and open competition basis in accordance with FAR 6.302 with Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) to provide Core Support for FMS customers of SM-1. Core support tasks include ordnance assessment, reliability, safety, and configuration management, and interface control, maintenance of as-designed configuration, engineering change traceability, product data management and access to support data via the internet.
<p>RMS is the only contractor possessing the required equipment, which consists of 30 unique test sets, necessary to perform these activities. Currently this test equipment is being used for SM-1 in addition to other missile programs at Raytheon facilities. Recreating this test equipment would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government.</p>

While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Solicitation W912EF-14-R-0004, previously announced under W912EF-13-R-0033.  <br>    <br> PLEASE NOTE CHANGE OF REQUIRED RESPONSE DATE BELOW. <br>  <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District (USACE) is soliciting multiple award, multiple year contracts for Professional Services - Biological Studies In the Snake and Columbia River Basins and Other Areas in the Northwest; Request for Proposal (RFP) W912EF-14-R-0004.  <br>    <br>  A professional services contract where consideration is being given to issuing a contract set aside for small business.   The North American Industry Classification code (NAICS) 541712.  The Small Business size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees as determined by 13 CFR 121.104.    <br>    <br>  The Walla Walla District Corps of Engineers (District) requires a range of professional and technical scientific expertise to fulfill specific biological objectives identified by the District under the Columbia River Fish Mitigation Program, the Continuing Authorities Program, the Project Authorities of the Dams and other programs directed and managed by the Corps.  The Corps intends to make multiple awards of indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts from a single solicitation.  Task orders under these contracts will be used for projects of varying size and complexity. Work under these contracts may also require contractors to provide services simultaneously in multiple locations.  <br>    <br>  The District needs to establish new contracts to continue research investigations, and respond to litigative issues associated with implementation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Most of the work conducted under the previous contracts has been focused on the passage of adult and juvenile salmonids, lamprey, and resident fish at hydroelectric projects.  Future work is anticipated to occur throughout the Northwest, including but not limited to the Columbia, Snake, and Willamette Basins, estuaries and near-shore ocean environment, Lake Washington, Puget Sound, and tributaries.  <br>    <br>  In future years, similar types of research needs are anticipated.  It is important to be aware that the topics, techniques, and scope of biological studies may need to evolve, based on changing priorities identified through regional discussions.  This has been readily accommodated by past Contractors with a broad array of professional experience available within their organization.  Less specifically focused types of biologically-related activities may also be requested.  These may involve the development of study plans, experimental designs, literature reviews, data analysis, or biological assessments.  In addition, studies may be conducted either in a laboratory setting or in the field, at a hydroelectric site or other locations.  The actual volume, type, and location of work to be undertaken during the term of this contract are uncertain.  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District (USACE) will be conducting a Pre-Proposal Conference for the acquisition of Professional Services - Biological Studies In the Snake and Columbia River Basins and Other Areas in the Northwest; Request for Proposal (RFP) W912EF-14-R-0004.  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this meeting is to provide interested companies with an overview of the program requirements and an opportunity to gather more information prior to the closing of the formal solicitation.   <br>    <br>  Registration: Registration by phone will NOT be accepted.

<AWARDEE>Peterson's Nelnet, LLC (784808300)  <br>  3 Columbia Cir Ste 205 <br>  Albany, NY 12203-5158
<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> OEMA requests a sole source purchase authorization for Peterson's Undergraduate Database. The mission of OEMA is to provide analytic support to decision makers in the Army Staff while providing educational support to the United States Military Academy (USMA). This analysis is based on 15-24 years of historical administrative data files stored in the OEMA Data Warehouse. To supplement the data OEMA receives from sources within the Department of the Army and Department of Defense (DOD), OEMA is often required to purchase data sources prepared by commercial entities. Recent projects from the Army Staff have necessitated the request for a new contract to procure the current Peterson's Undergraduate Database. <br>  <br> The Peterson's Undergraduate Database is a comprehensive and complete database in the field of higher education. This database contains information regarding hundreds of undergraduate, both two year and four year, institutions throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico; as well as a small number of institutions located in other foreign countries. There are versions of the Peterson's Undergraduate Database available covering 1984 through 2011. The Peterson's Undergraduate Database contains numerous proprietary rankings for each school in the United States. These rankings enable OEMA to make quantitative comparison among Colleges and Universities across the United States. Because of the Peterson's Undergraduate Database's unique position in comprehensive coverage across a wide spectrum of higher education, with over 22 years of historical data, it provides a solution for projects requiring utilization of data regarding undergraduate academic institutions. Peterson's has exclusive License Terms to Netlet's Graduate Comprehensive Database.  <br>

<DESC>WHS/Financial Management Directorate has a requirement to provide maintenance and support for 150 IBM Host Access Client Package (HACP) licenses. This product is being used by the mission essential system WAAS Allotment Accounting System. This software provides web browser 3270 connectivity to the WAAS/TFSA applications. No other vendor has the necessary tools, nor is any other vendor positioned to manage the interrelationships, dependencies, and data exchange requirements that must be carefully developed and maintained to ensure data integrity. Further, the introduction of any other vendor or manufacturer's product would present unacceptable mission and financial risk to WHS. This effort is necessary to ensure WHS compliance with Capital Planning and Investment Control requirements pursuant to 40 USC 1131-2, and OMB Circular A-130. The maintenance is required for FY 2014.

<ARCHDATE>12162013
<DESC><p>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), to negotiate a sole source contract with The Regenstrief Institute, Inc., 1050 Wishard Blvd., Indianapolis, IN 46202-2872 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This acquisition is for the Creation, Maintenance and Distribution of Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC&reg;), a proprietary nomenclature developed by the Regenstrief Institute as a source of standard identifiers, names and codes for clinical observations, clinical document types, claims attachment sets and individual questions being asked as part of claims attachments for use in standard administrative health transactions and government and private sector computer-based patient record. This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement; and is issued for notification purposes only. Any interested party should contact the Contract Specialist below for more information regarding this posting. All correspondence shall be received no later than December 16, 2013 at 3:00 PM EST.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541511: Custom Computer Programming Services and FSC code D318: IT &amp; Telecommunications - Integrated hardware/software/services solutions. The small business size standard is $25.5 million.<br /><br />The purpose of this project is to ensure the continued maintenance of LOINC as a freely available and openly developed source of standard identifiers, names and codes for clinical observations, clinical document types, claims attachment sets and individual questions being asked as part of claims attachments for use in standard administrative health transactions and government and private sector computer-based patient records. There may be follow-on procurements beyond the period of performance on this contract action if, as expected, the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (Regenstrief) continues to hold the copyright for LOINC and LOINC maintains its designation as a standard for use in US systems for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.<br /><br />LOINC was first developed by Regenstrief in 1994 to fill the need for moving clinical data generated by laboratories to the hospitals, physician's offices, and payers who use the data for clinical care and management purposes. NLM's involvement with LOINC originated through the applications of LOINC as part of broader projects to test the utility of an Indianapolis Regional Network for Primary and Emergency Care (N01-LM-4-3501, N01-LM-6-3546). In FY 1999, NLM awarded a three-year contract to Regenstrief for the continued development and free public distribution of LOINC on behalf of HHS, VA and DOD (N01-LM-9-3517). In FY 2003, NLM awarded a five-year follow up contract to Regenstrief to ensure the continued maintenance, expansion and free public distribution of LOINC (N01-LM-3-3501). NLM awarded another five-year follow-up contract to Regenstrief in FY 2008 (HHSN276200800006C). The purpose of this new contract, is to fund the LOINC project for an additional five years. This requirement is set to begin in FY 2014 as the previous contract has elapsed and is only valid as a result of FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.<br /><br />Regenstrief has unique knowledge and capabilities regarding the development and ongoing maintenance and distribution of LOINC. LOINC is a proprietary nomenclature developed and maintained by Regenstrief and the LOINC Committee, which Regenstrief directs with broad industry input and participation. As previously mentioned, Regenstrief also holds the copyright for LOINC. Therefore, Regenstrief is the only organization capable of maintaining and extending LOINC in order to meet HHS and other federal agency requirements (HHS, VA and DoD all have a vested interest in the LOINC system). There are no other acquisition sources or in-house alternatives. Any other solution would result in substantial duplication costs and unacceptable delays.<br /><br />All proposals received within fifteen (15) days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by NLM. The NLM synopsis number is NIH-LM-2013-770. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the services required by NLM. The offeror shall include all information necessary that documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its proposal. All responses from responsible sources will be considered. Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 101Q3, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention: Justin Fraser, Contract Specialist or (301) 435-4375. RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 3:00 PM EST ON December 16, 2013, AND SHALL BE SENT VIA E-MAIL TO: Justin.Fraser@nih.gov. Proposals must be submitted electronically. Paper proposals will not be accepted. The maximum page limit for proposals is 40 pages. All proposals shall be written in 12 point font and have one inch page margins. Titles and heading font size are at the offeror's discretion. <br /><br />Vendor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): https://acquisition.gov/far/ and Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulations (HHSAR): http://www.hhs.gov/regulations/hhsar/subpart352.html.</p>
