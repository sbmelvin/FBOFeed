<DESC>The following questions have been received.&nbsp; The Government's answer follows in italics.<br /><br />1.Will there be any slope exclusion allowed for this project? <br /><br /><em>The slope has been excluded from the project using GIS layers. Should the contractors find themselves on excessive slope it is unlikely they are on the fire line as these tend to go along ridgelines.<br /></em><br />2.Can you describe the relative ease of access to the project areas?<br /><em>The project has several roads leading relatively close to the project area. The contractor will then have to hike to get to the handline locations to gain access to the survey area.<br /><br /></em>3.Have the difficulties in Linear Site recording been straightened out with the Colorado SHPO yet?<br /><br /><em>We're&nbsp;not sure what you're referring to, but the segment within the project will be recorded as a segment of the linear site and you will not have to visit the entire stock driveway within the scope of the project. <br /><br /></em>4.On the map provided, are the previously documented sites correct? I can only see 8 on the map and 4 of these are not located within the project area.<br /><br /><em>The previously documented sites are correct. There are several that are located within the larger polygons and you will need to determine if they require separate recording or are a site and some are quite small and near the project area. This is a landscape project with limited funds, so&nbsp;we can only contract out a portion of the work that needs to be done in the area, thus some of the sites seem outside of the project area that includes survey, but are within the overall project area.<br /><br /></em>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged; the due date is unchanged.
