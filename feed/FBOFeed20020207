<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). Laser Trimming/Cutting System, 1 ea., per the following: SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The system is intended to function as a trimming system for adjusting the resistance of thin sputtered films of various metal alloys and also to function as a cutting tool to fabricate thin metal components of small and complex shapes.  The system shall consist of a laser, a positioning system for moving the beam and/or sample, a video viewing system, and a computer control system.  The system shall be enclosed in an eye-safe enclosure for the safety of the operator. A vacuum system shall be provided to collect debris from the trimming and cutting operation.  The system shall be powered by a standard 120/210 VAC drop and cooled by 50 degree F. house cooling water, if necessary.   SAMPLE DATA The sample substrate will vary in size from as large as 12" X 12" X 0.5" to as small as 0.25" X 0.25" X 0.010".  The substrate may be non-flat (e.g.a curved or sloped surface).  The trim area shall be limited to no more than 3" X 3".  The alloys to be trimmed and cut shall include, but are not limited to, platinum-13%rhodium, palladium-13%chromium, pure platinum & pure tungsten.  The thickness of the alloys will range from 0.1 microns to 50 microns.  The substrate material for the thin films to be trimmed will range from aluminum oxide to silicon carbide ceramic matrix composites to super alloys such as MARM-200.  The thicker alloys to be cut will be freestanding.     LASER AND OPTICS The laser shall be of such a size (output power, pulse repetition rate, pulse width and wavelength) to perform the necessary trimming and cutting operations as described above.  The laser shall perform the operations at no more than 75% of maximum power, that is, the laser shall have a minimum of 25% power margin left in performing the trimming/cutting operations.  The laser shall be capable of operating in the infrared (IR) and green portion of the spectrum.  The change over from IR to green and back shall not require more than one hour of setup time by the operator.  The laser power to the smaple shall be computer-controlled and adjustable by the operator. POSITIONING SYSTEM The position system shall be capable of holding a 12" X 12" sample onto a vacuum chuck.  The vertical space (z-axis) for the sample shall be at least 6". The overall course travel shall be 12" X 12" (x and y axis) with an accuracy of at least 0.00".  In addition there shall be a fine positioning system capable of positioning the spot on the sample within 3 microns.  The vacuum chuck shall be capable of manually rotating the sample 360 degrees.  The position of the beam focus (z-axis) shall be computer controlled over a range of at least 0.5". VIEWING SYSTEM The viewing system shall consist of at least one video camera, monitor and associated optics.  The system shall be capable of viewing the sample's surface while trimming is taking place.

<DESC>The work includes three (3) indefinite quantity contracts for miscellaneous design and engineering services for underwater facility assessments of Government waterfront facilities at various locations, worldwide.  The general intention is for the contractor to provide design and engineering services that will be described and procured through appropriate task orders for each contract.  The government intends to set aside two of the three contracts for Small Business.  One of the three contracts will be awarded on an unrestricted basis.
Underwater assessment includes, but is not limited to, underwater inspection; engineering analysis of existing conditions in comparison to design requirements, previous inspection reports and/or drawings of the facilities; engineering calculations for structural analysis with or without previous design calculations; documentation of findings; and recommendations with cost estimates for follow-on actions.  All underwater assessments will be performed under direct control and supervision of registered professional engineer-divers.  For each underwater assessment, one registered professional engineer-diver shall be appointed as the engineer-in-charge (EIC).  That EIC shall supervise the diving, dive at least 50% of the time, supervise the writing of the detailed inspection report, and write at least 50% of the detailed inspection reports.  The other engineers on-site may write the balance of the inspection report.  The EIC shall ensure that all diving is performed in accordance with OSHA standards.  US citizenship is required for access to inspection sites.
Additional products and services may include construction contract drawings and SPECSINTACT specifications; bid analyses; post construction award services (PCAS); Title II inspection services; engineering report review; database design, construction and population; procedures and guidelines reports; engineering calculations; static and dynamic structural and using computer modeling; three-dimensional structure modeling and rendering; seismic vulnerability assessments, including analysis of critical elements and development of retrofit schemes; water tank inspections in accordance with applicable standards of the American Waterworks Association and NAVFAC MO-210.9; and FHWA certified bridge inspections using NBIS standards for overland and over water bridges.   
A waterfront facility is defined as any structure located on the waterfront, in connection with, or potentially in contact with, water or the marine environment.  This would include inland structures that require underwater investigations.  Waterfront facilities include, but are not limited to, piers, wharves, bulkheads, quaywalls, offshore towers, potable water storage tanks, dams, water control structures; instrument support structures, dry docks, moorings, bridges, underwater cables, or any similar structure.
The duration of the contracts will be for a period of one base year, with the possibility of two option years.  The guaranteed minimum amount under each contract shall be $20,000 for the base year only.  The estimated total amount contracted for each contract shall not exceed $2,500,000 per year.    The selected firms for these contracts will be required to provide a fee proposal within ten days after receiving the Request for Proposal for each task order.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, announces the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP) to support research on Cortical Control of Neural Prostheses. The goal of this research is to establish the feasibility of generating control signals from cortical neurons involved in the voluntary control of limb movement.  The focus of this research will be on the development of chronic microelectrode recording techniques in primates with a gyrencephalic brain, which can realistically be adapted to human implantation.  There will also be research on extracting control signals from the recorded neural activities.  Results from this area of research are needed by the Neural Prosthesis Program for providing information on the design of microelectrode recording array, the selection of recording sites, the number of cells required for providing stable and functional control signals, and the plasticity in recorded cell populations when the neural activity is co-opted to control an artificial device.  Based on the results of these studies the contractors will make recommendations about the feasibility of future human studies.  Experiments on human subjects, however, are not included in the current supported research program.  It is anticipated that two cost-reimbursement type contract will be made for a period of four years in September 2002.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  THIS SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY ONLY.  It will be available electronically and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NINDS website at the following URL address:  (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/currentrfps.htm) 15 or more calendar days after the issuance of this synopsis.  OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ROUTINELY CHECKING THIS WEBSITE FOR ANY POSSIBLE SOLICITATION AMENDMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NO INDIVIDUAL NOTIFICATION OF ANY AMENDMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency.  Refer to numbered note 26.  ****

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole soruce basis, under the Simplified Acquisitions Procedures a firm fixed price award to Ms. Marilyn Newton, 21 Old Granary Court, Catonsville, Maryland 21228.  The purpose of this contract is two-fold:  (1) to procure expert services to assist CMS staff in planning, prioritizing, and conducting all data analyses relevant to developing proposed and final rules for the OPPS for 2003; and, (2) to assist CMS in modifying its OPPS data programs and constructing standard analytic data files for future updates.  The contractor would perform the following eight major tasks:  (1) Assist in coordinating all activities related to incorporating new policy decisions into rate calculations and impact analyses, (2) Provide quality assurance and oversight of all activities related to analyses needed for publication of the OPPS proposed and final rules for 2003, including construction of addenda and public use files, (3) Provide advice and assistance in coordinating individual and group tasks needed to generate work products, (4) Develop specifications and data requirements to construct a standard analytical file for annual update of OPPS and policy analysis, (5) Develop the approach and processes needed to evaluate data obtained from secondary sources to evaluate the clinical integrity of specific payment groups and relative payment weights, (6) Provide advice related to methods for renovating current programming to maximize efficient and accurate data processing, (7) Evaluate and assess reasonableness of final results within the context of discretionary and statutory policies and requirements, and (8) assist in developing processes to ensure thorough documentation of analytical files and related policy decisions that underlie the proposed and final OPPS rules.

CMS requires the services of a contractor with extensive knowledge of and experience with systems analysis and data modeling for Medicare prospective payment system.  The OPPS update for 2003 and construction of standard analytic data files for future updates cannot be completed timely without the services of an experienced contractor. Marilyn Newton possesses the experience, knowledge, and expertise that are required for this project.  She has over 30 years of experience with Medicare payment systems that she acquired as a CMS employee.  For 26 of these years, she performed research, systems analyses, and data development for various payment systems including the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system and the physician fee schedule.  During a substantial number of those years, she planned, prioritized, and directed the work of a large staff responsible for completing such tasks.  As a result of this work, Ms. Newton has acquired an indepth knowledge of Medicare data reporting requirements and claims processing.  She has vast knowledge of and experience with the various systems through which Medicare bills are processed and the types of edits applied to each system.  She has expert knowledge of the recently implemented Claims Expansion/Line Items Processing (CELIP), which hospitals are required to use to bill for outpatient services paid under the OPPS, and the software that is used to edit and pay these claims.  She has considerable experience with and knowledge of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) that is required for OPPS billing and used to construct the OPPS analytical data files.  In 1999, Ms. Newton assisted in completing the system analyses and data modeling that resulted in the successful implementation of the new OPPS on August 1, 2000.  Ms. Newton provided invaluable assistance in modifying the OPPS analytical files to incorporate new policy decisions and requirements for the 2001 and the 2002 OPPS updates. Ms. Newton?s extensive experience in working with the OPPS analytical files and programs coupled with her extensive past experience as a leader in resolving policy issues, constructing appropriate data files, and coordinating the programming needed for the 2001 and 2002 OPPS updates amplify her importance in successfully updating the OPPS for 2003.  Her expert services are essential to assist a team of policy analysts in identifying the data elements, files, and programming that require modification; to analyze and resolve policy issues related to such modifications; to coordinate the programming that incorporates policy changes; to calculate payment rates and relative weights; to develop impact analyses; to construct all addenda and related public use files for the 2003 proposed and final rules; to renovate programs for maximum efficiency in data processing; and to implement appropriate data file documentation.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>NA The US Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center, Dugway Proving Ground Contracting Office, Dugway, Utah, intends to issue a solicitation to CLR Photonics, Inc., a Division of Coherent Technologies Inc., on a non-competitive basis for 1 each IR doppler laser r adar, specifically the WindTracer BioChemical System.  The WindTracer is a single pulse eye safe laser with an effective range between 350 meters and 12 Km. The system is off the shelf technology that is primarily used to detect wind fields around airports  for safety considerations.  The WindTracer has been used during detector testing at Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) to identify biological simulant releases.  A typical application includes plume and bioaerosol agent detection, measurement, and tracking.  The  system is usually installed as a fixed ground station, but can also be used on small aircraft or as a mobile unit on a moving platform.  The product provides direct range-resolved, spatially distributed measurement of atmospheric wind and aerosols through  the use of optical heterodyne (coherent) detection.  Laser pulses are transmitted into the atmosphere and scattered off of naturally occurring small dust particles (aerosols).  The return light is Doppler-shifted by moving aerosols.  The sensor detects th is frequency shift.  This process is ideally suited for volumetric wind-field mapping, vertical wind profiling, and the measurement of particulate concentrations over municipal-sized areas.  The WindTracer as delivered, will include a MAG-1 Transceiver wit h 10 cm optics and the RASP-VME signal processor.  A graphical user interface and computer as well as a hemispherical scanner with a video camera will also be delivered.  The unit will be housed in an environmental shelter.  The software to be delivered wi ll include mapping overlay capability that matches up with the DPG test grids and has GPS reference grids.  The software will also display wind vectors to aid in the conduct of outdoor field trial planning.  This capability should decrease the cost of test ing by providing the test director with real time displays of wind direction and speed over large areas.  The system will be used to support meteorological as well as chemical simulant testing.  The software will also be capable of displaying particulate a erosol cloud location and movement, a very valuable tool for operational and developmental testing of biological detection systems.  Coherent Technologies previously participated in an advanced concept technology demonstration.  The goal was to evaluate pe rformance of known biological simulant aerosol detectors.  The Windtracer demonstrated its capabilities to detect airborne aerosol particles, and was validated to provide consistent and reliable results.  No other commercial off the shelf system has been v alidated. The required equipment must be delivered by June 02.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy's Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program. The requirements are: a C-37A Pilot Initial course, a C-37A Pilot Recurrent course, a non-aircraft specific Pilot Initial International Procedures course, and a non-aircraft specific Pilot Recurrent International Procedures course. Training will include providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, contractor possessing course access/data rights, training devices, supervision, and other services necessary for classroom, trainer (for applicable C-37A course), and simulator training (for applicable C-37A course).  The Navy C-37A (Navy configured Gulfstream G-V) CACT program courses require classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA certified simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "D" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Gulfstream G-V (G-V-V) configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The C-37A pilot courses must be taught at a FAA 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 Gulfstream G-V certified Training Center. All contractor C-37A pilot instructors shall be certified under the 14 CFR Part 142 Training Center certification.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-37A Training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification. 
The anticipated course requirements shall include: 1) C-37A Pilot Initial Course -: The C-37A Pilot Initial Training course shall be conducted for each trainee in accordance with the Approved Training Syllabi (ATS).  Training will be performed at a contractor provided facility within a continuous period not to exceed 25 consecutive days (a maximum of 22 training days).  The Pilot Initial course shall minimally be 124.0 training hours in length consisting of: administration/check-in; lessons in general aircraft systems; Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) and Category II approach training; aircraft performance training; cockpit familiarization training; part task trainer (PTT) sessions; simulator sessions; and completion of a course exam and course evaluation. The Pilot Initial course shall minimally include eight (8) 6.0-hour (48.0 hours total) simulator periods each consisting of a 1.0-hour pre-brief, 4.0 hours flight simulator time divided equally between the right and left seat (2.0-hours each seat), and a 1.0-hour debrief.  At least one simulator period shall be dedicated for Head-up Guidance System (HGS) /Heads-Up-Display (HUD) training. Each crew of two pilots shall jointly receive a minimum of 4.0-hours in a part task trainer (PTT) or higher level training device (i.e., simulator) to address specific aircraft systems (e.g., avionics, FMS).  PTT shall minimally include a 4.0-hour period divided equally between the right and left seat (with a 0.5-hour pre-brief, 3.0- hours actual part task trainer time and a 0.5-hours debrief). 
2) C-37A Pilot Recurrent Course - The C-37A Pilot Recurrent Training course shall be conducted for each trainee in accordance with the ATS. Training will be performed at a contractor provided facility within a continuous period not to exceed 5.0 consecutive days (a maximum of 5.0 training days).  The C-37A Pilot Recurrent Training course shall minimally be 32.0 training hours in length consisting of: administration /check-in, lessons in general aircraft systems review and aircraft updates/lessons learned, HUD  and RVSM review, simulator sessions, and a trainee course evaluation.

Pilots completing the C-37A training courses shall have reviewed all areas necessary to satisfactorily meet the FAA requirements under 14 CFR Part 61 for Pilot-in-Command and Second-in-Command for a FAA Type Rating.  Receipt of a FAA type or ATP rating or FAA check flight certificate is not a C-37A pilot course requirement.  All flight simulator-training periods should be geared to "flight training", vice "check flights".  Inclusion of Enhanced Visual System (EVS) training in the C-37A pilot courses is desired.  
3) Pilot Initial International Procedures - A Pilot Initial International Procedures course (non-aircraft specific) shall be conducted. Training shall be performed at a contractor-approved facility within a continuous period not to exceed 3.0 consecutive days (a maximum of 3.0 training days).

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325414 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. SCHEDULE:  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Vaccine Research Center (VRC) intends to procure custom DNA Oligonucleotides on a sole source basis from Invitrogen using simplified acquisition procedures.  The Immunology Lab of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) is developing vaccines for HIV, Ebola and, other viral diseases.  Cloning and making different mutations of viral proteins at the DNA level is critical to the vaccine development.  In order to continue the advances made possible by this research, it is vitally important that the custom DNA Oligonucleotides that have been used in Protocol #Z5001, continue to be constant and consistent in order not to compromise the results of the research.  Changing or adding variables would delay and/or hinder the research.  Synthesized DNA primers will be used in polymerase chain reaction to amplify the number of copies of a particular DNA fragment; overlapping polymerase chain reaction to generate new DNA molecules, site-directed mutagenesis of DNA molecules; and DNA sequencing reactions.  The vendor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the following:  1) provide personnel who have expertise in the DNA primer synthesis, 2) provide sufficient equipment for synthesizing DNA within 24 hours after receiving an order.  Vendor will be required to synthesize 50-200 nmoles of DNA primers of 15-100 nucleotides in length.  Short primers (<40 bases) will be de-protected, desalted and lyophilized.  In addition, longer primers will be purified with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.  The final products should be sent to the VRC by courier or by an overnight shipping service, 3) re-make the primers if the quality of the said product is below the prevalent standard, and 4) geographic proximity of vendor to the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD is desirable in order to facilitate transfer of orders, and DNA primers as needed.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with TNO-MADYMO North America Inc. The MADYMO lumped parameter simulation software has been used within NHTSA's Office of Crashworthiness research on SGI Original 2000 computer running SGI Irix for over ten years. The software is used throughout the automotive industry to simulate occupant/restraints/vehicle interactions during impacts and crash events. The software and its associated human and crash dummy databases have been extensively tested and calibrated so that the results can effectively simulate 'real world' impacts of the 5th 50th, and 95th percentile humans. MADYMO simulations are currently used to support almost all of NHTSA's research program including airbag aggressivity, rollover, side, pedestrian, rear impact, offset and frontal impact. Additionally, NHTSA has spent significant research funds in developing MADYMO models of several vehicles, dummies, and restraint systems. These engineering databases have taken considerable resources to develop and would need to be converted before using a different analysis package. Moreover, there must be software support and user training over the duration of the lease agreement and the contractor must provide onsite training and/or vendor site training for NHTSA and Volpe Staff, located at Volpe transportation Research Center, DTS-74, Cambridge, MA. The Government anticipates making a fixed price type contract with a base year and four Option years. Interested firms should identify their capability to provide the requested software as described above. The written response must include detail information relating to the specific software being requested. Expressions of interest without sufficient detail to permit evaluation of ones ability to provide the software will not be considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive Proposals nor is a Request-for-Proposals solicitation document currently available. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive contract. In the absence of responses from interested firms demonstrating their capability, NHTSA intends to request a quotation from the TNO-MADYMO North America Inc. on a noncompetitive basis for the work described. Responses must be received by the listed procuring office within 15 days from the date of publication of this notice.

<DESC>NA Weir Structures:  The Contractor shall furnish all labor, material, equipment, tools, supervision and perform all operations necessary to accomplish all work involved with fabrication and installation of one (1) 16’ long x 25’ tall x 4’ wide steel weir str ucture in Cell 3 and two (2) 16’ long x 5’ tall x 4’ wide steel weir structure extensions in Cells 1 and 2.  Fabrication of the 25’ tall structure can occur through construction of the entire structure with all new members or can be accomplished by constru cting the lower 15 feet of the structure (all new members) and using the upper 10 feet of the existing structure for a resultant height of 25 feet.  The top 10’ of the existing weir structure will be cut off by others and placed adjacent to the current wei r location for use by the weir Contractor if so desired.  The extensions will require removal of the top cross bracing on the existing structures and will be constructed in the same fashion to that of the top five feet of the structure shown in the attache d drawings.  *Wage Determination Number 94-2301(18) dated 05/31/2001 will apply. Special Note:  The Contractor shall attend an on-site pre-bid meeting before furnishing a bid.  Upon receipt of the bid package, bidders should notify Steve Reid or Mitch McDe rment (251-957-6019) of the Irvington Site Office for information regarding the pre-bid meeting.  The weirs to be replaced/extended are located on the inside of the earthen-diked dredged material disposal area where shown on the attached drawing.  These di kes were raised within the last couple of years through stacking of the within disposal area material (then rather wet) into the current dike shape with compaction efforts being that obtained with the bucket of the excavation/placement equipment; therefore , the Contractor should pay special attention in determining his access routes to the weirs and equipment selection and placement thereof. Delivery and Placement of Weir Structures:  The Triple Barrel Disposal Area is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi on the west bank of the East Pascagoula River west of Ingalls Access Road and north of the Pascagoula Navy Homeport access road.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for blocking filters for the XRS-2 instrument. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from Luxel Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source. Low temperature x-ray microcalorimeters require very thin filters for rejecting non-x-ray radiation, yet providing the highest possible transmission in the x-ray band (0.1 - 10 keV).  Obtaining high x-ray transmission requires films that are only about 1000 angstroms thick and coated with only a few hundred angstroms of aluminum.  These filters have diameters that can be as large as several inches and are extremely delicate.  The use of these filters in the ultra low temperature environment required by the XRS microcalorimeter detector is even more challenging since the filters become very brittle when cold. The XRS-2 instrument will be a copy of the original XRS instrument built for ASTRO-E.  The Astro-E/XRS blocking filters were manufactured by Luxel Corporation.  For x-ray applications, Luxel has developed the unique expertise for making these filters as strong as possible without compromising optical performance.  They have developed proprietary formulations for filter materials especially designed for high strength at cryogenic temperatures.  In order to meet the required specifications and delivery schedule for this instrument, the blocking filters can only be purchased from Luxel because of prior testing and proprietary information. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, February 22, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the purchase of two spacecraft simulators to support software testing for SWIFT software development. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the items on a sole source basis from The Hammers Company under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source. The simulators must be received within 2 months ARO or the Government's software schedule will slip.  The software is on the critical path for the instrument, which is in turn on the critcal path for the mission itself.  The simulators must meet the interface requirements specified in the SWIFT 1553 BUS protocol ICD and the performance requirements specified in the requirements for high fidelity SWIFT spacecraft simulators.  There are no standard commercial products available that can meet the interface requirements within cost and schedule.  From prior work with the project, the Hammers Company has already developed a simulator that meets our requirements.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Goverment and the project to procure these items from the Hammers Company.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, February 22, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Contract Period: All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders.  The maximum ordering limitation will be $10,000,000.00 for the life  of the contract. Each task order will not exceed  $250,000.00.  The $10,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years.  The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00.  Sustainable Design and Construction Practices: The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice,  sustainable design utilizes best available solutions  within the design tradition and conserves global  resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles  materials and waste, and specifies ecologically  responsible methods, practices, and materials in the  construction, maintenance and operation of Government  facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must  exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certification and membership in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices.  The National Park Service, Pacific West Region has implemented Directive PW-048 which delineates how it emphasizes the concept of sustainability with respect to design and construction practices.  Implementing sustainable design and construction practices is the constant process of identifying and incorporating activities and actions during facility planning, design, construction and operation to meet the following goals:  (a) Consume less energy and natural resources over the life of the facility; (b) Ensure that resources such as water, air and land are as clean or cleaner at the end of use as at the beginning; (c) Ensure that the viability, integrity and diversity of natural systems are protected, undiminished and maintained; (d) Ensure that natural sound-scape and dark skies are undiminished; (e) Use green technologies and products that have less negative  impacts on human health and the environment; (f) Reduce the material entering landfills; and (g) Ensure compliance with all natural and cultural requirements.  Executive Orders: In accordance with Public Law 100-418 and Executive Order 12770, as of January 1994, all Federal design work will be done using the metric system of weights and measures.  Work done under this contract may be subject to this requirement.  The Government will not indemnify the firm selected against liability involving asbestos or other hazardous materials; that is, a clause holding the firm harmless will not be included in the contract. Executive Order 13101 – Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,” (September 14, 1998).  This Executive Order requires Federal Agencies to incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the  Agency’s operation and work to increase and expand  markets for recovered materials through greater Federal Government preference and demand for such products.  In developing work plans, work statements and specifications, Agencies must consider   “elimination of virgin materials requirements, use of bio-based products, use of recovered materials, reuse of product, lifecycle cost and lifecycle assessment, recycle ability, use of environmental preferable products, waste prevention and ultimate disposal.”  The Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), Section 6002, and  Executive Order 113101 require the purchase of  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated  products with a required minimum recovered material  content as described in an Agency’s Affirmative  Procurement Program (APP).  This list of EPA-designated products is available at http://www.epa.gov/cpg.  This requirement applies to all contracts that require EPA-designated products.  When purchasing a product or products on this list without the required minimum recovered material content, a written justification based on specific exemptions is required by FAR 23.405c.  A/E firms and their consultants are required to be familiar with EPA guidelines by developing specifications utilizing EPA’s minimum recycled content standards.  If products specified by the A/E do not meet  EPA’s guidelines, the A/E must prepare written  justifications in accordance with FAR 23.405c.  A/E  firms are to use life-cycle cost analysis, wherever  feasible and appropriate to assist selection of products and services. Whenever possible, costs shall be calculated over the life of the item, not just the  initial, up-front cost.  When comparing alternative  products, the initial cost of acquisition as well as  maintenance costs, operational costs, etc., must be  considered in the analysis.  A product having a higher initial cost may have lower operational costs or higher resale value and will, therefore, prove to be a better value and more cost effective compared to the alternatives.  Primary Services Required: For the  purpose of this contract, the services to be provided  will be primarily Research, Inventory, Pre-design,  Compliance, and Supplemental Services (Title I  Services), Design and Construction Documents (Title II Services) and Construction Management (Title III  Services).  All professionals shall be registered in the States in which the work is performed. Title I  Services:  Services in this category may include, but  are not limited to, the preparation of historic  structure reports, cultural landscape reports, cultural landscape inventories, historic resource studies, archeological site surveys, materials analysis, condition assessment, hazardous material investigations, natural and cultural compliance documentation, HABS/HAER documentation, topographic and geologic surveys, building program and budget review, conceptual and schematic design documents, and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Specific activities may involve project scoping and programming; site planning/analysis, site design, environmental assessments, National Register of Historic Places significance assessments, design analysis, energy and life cycle/value analysis, outline specifications, and preliminary and detailed cost estimates.  Title II Services: Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, preparation of design development documents, construction drawings, and construction specifications and preparation of construction cost  estimates for stabilization, restoration or  rehabilitation of historic structures, sites and  cultural landscapes and peer-review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Final construction documents (i.e., plans and specifications) must be furnished to the NPS in an electronic format capable of being transmitted over the Internet to the general public via electronic commerce.  Title III Services: Services in this category may include, but not limited to, construction management services, which include management from the construction contract award to final acceptance of actions required  to complete the proposed facility, including the  warranty period.  This includes construction  observation, review of submittals, value engineering,  site visits, field testing, construction support, and  consultation during construction.  Much of the work to be performed in historic buildings and sites will  require continuous attention to compliance with historic preservation guidelines, techniques, and oversight.  Coordination:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  Technical Evaluation Criteria: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order  of importance:  (1) Professional qualifications of  individuals listed to perform under the contract,  including individual licenses and experience in the work proposed; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract, particularly small projects (i.e., knowledge of indigenous cultures and practices, architectural styles, historic construction methods, etc.) in various climatic regions (for example, high mountain, heavy snow  areas, arid deserts and coastal) (NOTE: Generally,  design services between $5,000 and $50,000); (3)  Specific past performance records on previous  architect/engineering work, cultural landscape work, and historical research work performed for Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets, and ability to respond to small projects (NOTE:  Generally, design services between $5,000 and $50,000); (4)Demonstration of a sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources and the global environment; (5) Ability of the team to communicate, and coordinate, facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary  design team managed through the NPS in the Pacific Great Basin Support Office and park/field areas located in California and Nevada.  (NOTE: Locations of park units/field areas may be requested and obtained under separate cover.) Emphasis will be placed on the team’s ability to work with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns; (6) Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs.  In addition to other factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (i.e. multiple awards); and (7) Location in the general geographic area of the proposed projects and knowledge of the locality and the associated design and construction considerations of the proposed projects  (i.e., knowledge of local pricing/cost of construction within geographical restrictions).  When responding to this announcement, firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the foregoing evaluation factors. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 19.10) and is therefore open to both small and large business concerns. Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses.  Subcontracting Plan Requirement: In accordance with Public Law 97-507, the A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it  intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for  this contract are that a minimum of 15% of the  contractor’s intended subcontract amount be placed with small business, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, and 3% to be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal; however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  Specialized Services:  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the National Park Service (NPS), the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even  though the work is performed primarily by the  subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated concerns with the monetary ceiling amounts and the effect of these “pass-throughs” would have on the cap. . This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  Submission Requirements: Firms wishing to be considered must submit completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, and other PERTINENT information.  Pertinent information submitted in support of the completed SF254’s and 255’s should not exceed 15 pages.  SF254’s and 255’s must also be submitted for subconsultants.  Clearly, specifically, and concisely address the evaluation criteria when completing the forms.  Offerors are requested to submit one original of their submittal.  Other marketing information such as booklets, pamphlets and brochures is neither requested nor desired.  Submittals must be received in the contracting office by no later than close of business 30 days after issuance of this request  in order to be considered for selection. Note, this is not a Request for Proposals.

Executive Order 13101 – Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,” (September 14, 1998).  This Executive Order requires Federal Agencies to incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the  Agency’s operation and work to increase and expand  markets for recovered materials through greater Federal Government preference and demand for such products.  In developing work plans, work statements and specifications, Agencies must consider the “elimination of virgin materials requirements, use of bio-based products, use of recovered materials, reuse of product, lifecycle cost and lifecycle assessment, recycle ability, use of environmental preferable products, waste prevention and ultimate disposal.”  The Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), Section 6002, and Executive Order 113101 require the purchase of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated products with a required minimum recovered material content as described in an Agency’s Affirmative Procurement Program (APP).  This list of EPA-designated  products is available at http://www.epa.gov/cpg.  This requirement applies to all contracts that require EPA-designated products.  When purchasing a product or products on this list without the required minimum recovered material content, a written justification based on specific exemptions is required by FAR 23.405c.  A/E firms and their consultants are required to be familiar with EPA guidelines by developing specifications utilizing EPA’s minimum recycled content standards.  If products specified by the A/E do not meet EPA’s guidelines, the A/E must prepare written justifications in accordance with FAR 23.405c.  A/E  firms are to use life-cycle cost analysis, wherever  feasible and appropriate to assist selection of products and services. Whenever possible, costs shall be calculated over the life of the item, not just the  initial, up-front cost.  When comparing alternative  products, the initial cost of acquisition as well as  maintenance costs, operational costs, etc., must be  considered in the analysis.  A product having a higher initial cost may have lower operational costs or higher resale value and will, therefore, prove to be a better value and more cost effective compared to the alternatives.  Primary Services Required: For the  purpose of this contract, the services to be provided  will be primarily Research, Inventory, Pre-design,  Compliance, and Supplemental Services (Title I  Services), Design and Construction Documents (Title II Services) and Construction Management (Title III  Services).  All professionals shall be registered in the States in which the work is performed. Title I  Services:  Services in this category may include, but  are not limited to, the preparation of historic  structure reports, cultural landscape reports, cultural landscape inventories, historic resource studies, archeological site surveys, materials analysis, condition assessment, hazardous material investigations, natural and cultural compliance documentation, HABS/HAER documentation, topographic and geologic surveys, building program and budget review, conceptual and schematic design documents, and peer review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Specific activities may involve project scoping and programming; site planning/analysis, site design, environmental assessments, National Register of Historic Places significance assessments, design analysis, energy and life cycle/value analysis, outline specifications, and preliminary and detailed cost estimates.  Title II Services: Services in this category may include, but are not limited to, preparation of design development documents, construction drawings, and construction specifications and preparation of construction cost  estimates for stabilization, restoration or  rehabilitation of historic structures, sites and  cultural landscapes and peer-review of NPS in-house or other A/E designs.  Final construction documents (i.e., plans and specifications) must be furnished to the NPS in an electronic format capable of being transmitted over the Internet to the general public via electronic commerce.  Title III Services: Services in this category may include, but not limited to, construction management services, which include management from the construction contract award to final acceptance of actions required to complete the proposed facility, including the  warranty period.  This includes construction  observation, review of submittals, value engineering,  site visits, field testing, construction support, and  consultation during construction.  Much of the work to be performed in historic buildings and sites will  require continuous attention to compliance with historic preservation guidelines, techniques, and oversight.  Coordination:  The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies.  Technical Evaluation Criteria: Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order  of importance:  (1) Professional qualifications of  individuals listed to perform under the contract,  including individual licenses and experience in the work proposed; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required under this contract, particularly small projects (i.e., knowledge of indigenous cultures and practices, architectural styles, historic construction methods, etc.) in various climatic regions (for example, high mountain, heavy snow  areas, arid deserts and coastal) (NOTE: Generally,  design services between $5,000 and $50,000); (3)  Specific past performance records on previous  architect/engineering work, cultural landscape work, and historical research work performed for Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private industry documenting the quality of the firm's work and the firm's history of meeting performance schedules and budgets, and ability to respond to small projects (NOTE:  Generally, design services between $5,000 and $50,000); (4)Demonstration of a sustainable design ethic, philosophy, and approach and the ability of the team to produce viable design solutions that show an awareness and sensitivity to local natural and cultural resources and the global environment; (5) Ability of the team to communicate, and coordinate, facilitate work expeditiously with the NPS, to participate in related meetings and readily integrate into a multi-disciplinary  design team managed through the NPS in the Pacific Great Basin Support Office and park/field areas located in California and Nevada.  (NOTE: Locations of park units/field areas may be requested and obtained under separate cover.) Emphasis will be placed on the team’s ability to work with multiple entities including Federal, State, and local agencies and other involved concerns; (6) Capacity to respond to expanded or multiple task orders on short notice and within the established schedules, while maintaining a high standard of quality and controlling costs.  In addition to other  factors, offers will be evaluated on the basis of  advantages and disadvantages to the Government that  might result from making more than one award (i.e.  multiple awards); and (7) Location in the general  geographic area of the proposed projects and knowledge of the locality and the associated design and construction considerations of the proposed projects (i.e., knowledge of local pricing/cost of construction within geographical restrictions).  When responding to this announcement, firms should fully address their capability, capacity and qualifications with regard to each of the foregoing evaluation factors. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (FAR 19.10) and is therefore open to both small and large business concerns. Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. Subcontracting Plan Requirement: In accordance with Public Law 97-507, the A/E firm will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The selected firm, if a large business, must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it  intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for  this contract are that a minimum of 15% of the  contractor’s intended subcontract amount be placed with small business, 5% shall be placed with women-owned businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, and 3% to be placed with service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal; however, contract award is contingent upon negotiation of an acceptable subcontracting plan.  Specialized Services:  In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the National Park Service (NPS), the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract.  In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors  have indicated concerns with the monetary ceiling  amounts and the effect of these “pass-throughs” would  have on the cap.  This has been taken into  consideration in establishing the maximum contract  amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner.  Submission Requirements: Firms wishing to be considered must submit completed Standard Forms (SF) 254 and 255, and other PERTINENT information.  Pertinent information submitted in support of the completed SF254’s and 255’s should not exceed 15 pages.  SF254’s and 255’s must also be submitted for subconsultants.  Clearly, specifically, and concisely address the evaluation criteria when completing the forms.  Offerors are requested to submit one original of their submittal.  Other marketing information such as booklets, pamphlets and brochures is neither requested nor desired.  Submittals must be received in the contracting office by no later than  close of business 30 days after issuance of this request in order to be considered for selection. Note, this is not a Request for Proposals.

The firm shall also demonstrate expertise in utilization of value methods in decisionmaking e.g. Choosing by Advantages or other method of evaluating non-monetary benefits; allowing the NPS to make benefit cost decisions and comparisons.  The NPS has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for park planing and development.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions, within the design tradition of the NPS, which conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifics ecologically responsible methods and practices, and materials in the construction and operation of park facilities.  The following criteria shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms in descending order of importance:  1. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; 2. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services, including knowledge of federal historic preservation laws; 3. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required including computer assisted design capability and capacity;  4. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time including ability to react on accelerated schedules; 5. Experience working in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of local conditions in Northeastern Minnesota (boreal forest, bedrock mantle); 6.

Contract period of performance will be for a one-year period from the date of contract award, with a Government option to extend the period of performance for four additional one-year periods. Services will be implemented through individual delivery orders.  A minimum of $5,000 in services is guaranteed for the basic contract period and each optioned year. The total of all delivery orders shall not exceed $60,000 per fiscal year.  This procurement is open to small and large businesses and is subject to Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program, Public Law 100-656.  To the fullest extent, the NPS welcomes the participation of small business firms including woman-owned and minority-owned and operated A/E firms and encourages large business firms to include small business firms as part of their team.  The North American Industrial Code is 54131.

<CONTACT>Kathleen Batke (404) 562-3163, x598
<DESC>NAIC: 541710 - This project is an inventory of the reptile and amphibian fauna of 17 national park units in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Kentucky.  The Park Service units to be inventoried are the Blue Ridge Parkway, The Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area, the Obed Wild and Scenic River, Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site, Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site, Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, Cowpens National Battlefield, Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, Fort Donelson National Battlefield, Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, Kings Mountain National Military Park, Little River Canyon National Preserve, Ninety Six National Historic Site; Russell Cave National Monument, Shiloh National Military Park, and Stones River National Battlefield.  For each project area, the goal is to detect and document 90 percent of the species reasonably expected to occur.  In addition, the distributional aspects of the herpetofauna within the project areas are to be accurately described, especially in sensitive areas and for legally protected, rare and otherwise sensitive taxa.  Comprehensive approaches to determining herpetofaunal assemblages in both terrestrial and wetland environments are needed, and the variety of features within the parks requires the application of multiple survey techniques.  In order to obtain a representative list of species for the project areas, herpetofaunal samples must encompass not only extensive cover types, but also minor habitats and features that may relate to species richness.  For those taxa for which no voucher exists in any curated collection, a museum specimen or photo is to be obtained and deposited at an NPS designated repository. Descriptive data to be recorded for each collection/observation site will include habitat information, ecological associations between species and habitat, frequency of occurrence for species encountered, as well as any other parameters that would provide insight into variations in distribution patterns and differences in species richness between sites.  Sampling will be divided between structured surveys of established permanent plots and general searches of habitats not covered by the permanent plots.  Geographic coordinates will be obtained for each collection and plot site.  The contractor shall be the primary researcher and author.  This project is to be completed within 2 to 3 years of initiation. All requests for solicitation packages must be in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The solicitation package will be issued on or about March 7, 2002.  The solicitation package will be issued by hard copy, floppy disc, CD rom, or Electronic Commerce (if available to the National Park Service).

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), Chemoprevention Agent Development Group (CADRG), is interested in evaluating inhibitors of carcinogenesis in vitro, in order to identify potential chemopreventive agents against cancer.  Such agents would  be further evaluated in appropriate animal efficacy or clinical settings.  The CADRG has established a clearly defined integrated plan for the evaluation of chemopreventive agents.  This plan delineates criteria for classifying information that currently exists on any chemopreventive agent and thus defines what additional information and investigations are required to qualify the agent's experimental use in intervention trials of human cancer.  The primary purpose of this RFP is to use in vitro methods to screen chemopreventive agents (see Methods in Cell Biology Vol 19(1):1-70, 1997).  The objective of these studies is to determine the efficacy of  chemopreventive agents in an array of in vitro model systems representing different cell substrates, those of human origin in particular.  The studies are designed to rank-order and  prioritize agents for further development.  Those interested in obtaining a copy of this RFP should send their e-mail address to Dorothy McMillan at dm308v@nih.gov and a copy of the RFP will be forwarded electronically.  AN AWARD WILL ONLY BE MADE TO A MASTER AGREEMENT HOLDER IN THE IN VITRO MASTER AGREEMENT POOL.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 54171.  Those who are not currently in the In Vitro Master Agreement Pool and who wish to be considered for inclusion should consult the Research Contracts Branch web site at Http://amb.nci.nih.gov under "Current Requests for Proposals" and refer to RFP/N01-CN-85093-40.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available around the middle of April 2002.  Questions should be directed, via facsimile or e-mail, to Dorothy McMillan, Contract Specialist, Prevention and Control Contracts Section, Research Contracts Branch, National Cancer Institute,  Bethesda, MD 20892-7226.  Phone: (301) 435-3828; fax: (301) 402-8579; e-mail: dm308v@nih.gov.  Please NOTE:  As result of move to temporary location, a corrected address for contracting office will be forwarded to interested parties prior to RFP deadline.  NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Numbered Note 26: Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

Unless another qualified source is available it is  anticipated that a sole source cost no fee award will be made to the  National Academy of Science Transportation Research Board (TRB).

The review will occur each winter, in time for a letter-style report to complete National Research Council (NRC) report review before Congress takes up the budget each spring (prior to markup).  Specific themes to be addressed as part of these peer reviews are (a) the agency's R&D management structure and approach, (b) the current direction and allocation of funds devoted to the various program areas, and (c) whether there is an appropriate balance of federal, state, and private-sector input and cost sharing.  Specifically, an analysis will continue to be undertaken of whether the directions and objectives outlined in FRA's  5-year strategic R&D plan are appropriate.  In the case of the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Program, the committee's task will be limited to conducting a program management review. 

Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualifications by 2:00 p.m., EST on Thursday February 28, 2002.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Dr. Qing Yu, Room 403, No. 7, Lane 289, Ling Lin Road, Shanghai, 200032, P.R. China, to provide research services on the identification of recessive lethal mouse mutations that cause heart defects. Dr. Yu is a pediatric cardiologist who is the attending physician at the Heart Center of the Children?s Hospital of Fudan University at Shanghai, P.R. China. She also has a PH.D. in Pediatric Cardiology, having pursued research work focused on the examination of heart malformations in rodent animal models. As a result, she has an unusual combination of expertise that includes clinical pediatric cardiology, mammalian cardiovascular developmental anatomy and physiology, heart development in rodent animal models. She will pursue a research project being initiated in the Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Division of Intramural Research of the NHLBI. The aforementioned project will be to conduct a screen for cardiovascular anomalies in ENU mutagenized mice using high frequency ultrasound. The goal of this work is to identify novel recessive mouse mutations that cause heart defects. Such mutations will pave the way for the identification of new genes that are essential for normal mammalian heart development. Dr. Yu?s experience and knowledge in pediatric cardiology and rodent heart development are essential for the completion of this government-sponsored research project. The Statement of Work for this research project is as follows: BACKGROUND: The Laboratory of Development Biology is initiation a new project to identify novel gene and genetic pathways that are essential for normal mammalian heart development. This will entail the use of a high throughput screen to identify novel mouse mutations that causes heart anomalies. The subsequent mapping of these mouse mutations will provide the means for gene discovery and aid in the elucidation of genetic mechanisms that regulate mammalian heart development. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research is the identification of recessive lethal mouse mutations that cause heart defects. Dr. Yu will use noninvasive in utero ultrasound imaging technique to analyze heart structure and function in fetuses derived from intercrosses of the F2 generation of ENU mutagenized mice generated at the Jackson Laboratory. This will be conducted as a high throughput screen, with images of the fetal heart recorded digitally. Dr. Yu will analyze 15-20 litters of mice per week, and over the course of a year, screen up to 1000 litters of mice. She will archive the data in an image based database system, and assist in their future analysis with quantitative measurements. Dr. Yu will carry out the bulk of these experiments at the Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine, where the equipment for this study will be set up in the laboratory of Dr. Jane Barker. She is expected to complete this screen on January 31, 2003. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS: The contractor will perform the ultrasound screen, which will entail anesthetizing pregnant female mice using inhalation anesthetics, and operating the Visual Sonics ultrasound machine to conduct the ultrasound scans. On a daily basis, the contractor will archive the newly acquired images onto the web based database system, which will be periodically purged. She will analyze the images with quantitative measurements and enter the measurements into a database system that is web accessible. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES: The Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Division of Intramural Research, NHLBI, will provide all of the equipment, computer hardware and software required for this project. The space and the mutagenized mice will be provided by the Jackson Laboratory through a previously arranged agreement between the Jackson Laboratory and Dr. Cecilia Lo. The contractor?s work will be reviewed and approved by Dr. Lo. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES: The contractor will report his/her research findings to Dr. Lo on a weekly basis by summarizing her results in a report to be sent via email, and also through daily deposits on the NHLBI hard drive, and the web based image database any newly acquired data. Once a month the contractor will travel to NIH for two days of consultation to present and discuss data collected in the preceding months and to evaluate experimental methods and procedures and project the work scope for the coming month. The contractor will report findings on a weekly basis to Dr. lo via email. On a monthly basis, the contractor will meet with Dr. Lo to review the cumulative findings and their scientific significance.
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: The contractor will come to NHLBI facilities in Bethesda, Maryland in February 2002 to receive one month of training before going to Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine. The contractor will make monthly trips to the NHLBI in Bethesda, Maryland for consultation and further characterization of mouse mutants using equipment at the Mouse Imaging Facility. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The research project period is from February 2002 through January 2003 and may be renewable given satisfactory progress. This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 and the Size Standard of 500 employees, are both applicable to this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to procure construction of a Sewer and Water Distribution System to connect all of the buildings at the National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR) in Beaufort, NC, to the Beaufort municipal water and sewer system.  This NOAA Laboratory complex shares Pivers Island with Duke University and is located between Beaufort and Morehead City.  The Beaufort sewer and water systems were previously extended across the channel to Pivers Island about 5 years ago, and these main lines and lift station were sized for all of the NOAA and Duke facilities on Pivers Island.  Duke University has already connected their buildings to this system.  
The Contractor shall provide all the labor, material, equipment and each and every item of expense to construct a Sewer and Water Distribution System to connect the NOAA buildings on Pivers Island to the existing Beaufort sewer and water distribution system on the east side of Pivers Island.  Construction work includes, but is not limited to, gravity sanitary sewer lines, water distribution systems, manholes, hydrants, conduits, dewatering, excavation, backfill, compaction, testing, cutting and patching, closure of existing systems, and landscaping.  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the government following the evaluation of technical and cost proposals.  The following technical and performance criteria will be used in evaluating the proposals: (1) Successful experience of the construction firm with construction of similar type projects, (2) Submission of a construction plan which exhibits understanding of the requirements and a strong plan for quality control and success, (3) Availability of key personnel experienced in construction of similar type projects, and (4) Primary firm?s planned participation in the project.  Technical and performance criteria are slightly more important than price.  The resultant procurement will be a firm-fixed price contract.  Completion time for this project is 150 calendar days.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Estimated Construction cost is from $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Drawings, specifications and bid documents will be available on or about February 27, 2002.  A pre-bid site visit will be scheduled in the bid documents approximately the second full week of March, 2002. All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>1.  Item 13.A, SF 1442.  Sealed offers due date is extended to 11 January 2002.

2.  A major amendment will be issued within the next ten days that changes the Basis of Award and the scope of the requirement. This is based on contractors concern that involves the coefficient factor, and how it will be used.  In addition, this amendment will indicate that the initial contract will only involve 5 ConUS locations (Not including Wildwood, NJ), and that the 6 Alaska sites will be the subject of a new solicitation when the first Alaska project is funded.  This is anticipated to be sometime in 2002, and will be posted to eps when appropriate.

<DESC>THE FOLLOWING IS A REVISED DESCRIPTION FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON JANUARY 24, 2002. The Midwest Regional Office of the National Park Service (NPS) in Omaha, Nebraska, is seeking qualified organizations to provide Architect/Engineer (A/E) services under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, and environmental(NEPA) services for parks in the Midwest Region (e.g., Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska).  More than one contract may be awarded under this solicitation. Work will consist of, but is not limited to, Title I Services, which includes physical investigation (surveying) and materials testing; preparation of conditions reports; preliminary designs and estimates; and other architectural, engineering,  landscape architectural, and environmental work.  Title II Services includes preparing construction drawings, specifications, and cost estimates.  Title III Services includes construction management services, e.g. observation, site visits, consultation, review of submittals and shop drawings, and preparing operation and maintenance manuals. AE firm shall demonstrate experience with conducting value analysis(VA) studies ( similar to value engineering(VE)) for projects and responding to value analysis proposals. AE shall identify facilitator (s) with Certified Value Specialist (CVS as certified by SAVE International) or approved equal, to conduct studies and consult with the prime with regard to decisionmaking methods. The firm shall demonstrate expertise in conducting value analysis(VA) at planning and pre-design stages, as well as the more traditional value engineering(VE) studies. The firm shall also demonstrate expertise in utilization of value methods in decisionmaking e.g. Choosing by Advantages (CBA), functional analysis e.g. FAST diagram, life cycle cost analysis, importance(benefit) to cost graphing or other method of evaluating non-monetary benefits; allowing the NPS to make benefit cost decisions and comparisons.  NPS policies and directives will guide all work; however, park resources often present unique and unusual conditions and the NPS encourages the participation of various disciplines in the review and planning process.  The NPS has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for park planning and development.  By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  In practice, sustainable design minimizes the short- and long-term environmental impacts of development activity through resource conservation, recycling, waste minimization, and the utilization of energy efficient and ecologically responsible materials and techniques for construction. The following criteria shall be used in the evaluation of the prospective firms in descending order of importance: 1. Professional qualifications of the principals and key staff of the firm and consultants for the performance of the desired services, 2.  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, 3. Capacity to respond to short timeframes and accomplish more than one project at a time within the desired schedules, while maintaining quality of work and control of costs, 4.Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules, 5. Location in the general geographical area of the Midwest Regional Office and knowledge of broad range of project localities in 13 states of Midwest Region, 6. Demonstrated success of sustainable processes and renewable technologies in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design. The total of all work orders per year shall not exceed $1 million, and no single work order shall exceed $500,000.  The A/E is guaranteed a minimum amount of $10,000 during the base year and each optioned year.  Following are examples of projects done in the past:  Agate Fossil Beds NM visitor center, utilities, parking area, and housing, Harrison, Nebraska; Badlands NP visitor center rehabilitation, Interior, South Dakota; George Washington Carver NM visitor center rehabilitation, parking lot, and contact station, Diamond, Missouri; and Jefferson NEM drop off zone and parking areas, St. Louis, Missouri. The term of this contract shall be 1 year from the date of contract award, with a government option to extend the period of performance for four additional 1-year periods.  All data processing and storage, including specifications, cost estimates, technical reports, and special studies shall be compatible with Microsoft Office 97 word processing and Microsoft Access data storage software.  The A/E shall have the capability of preparing drawings and graphic material using AutoCAD 2002 software. If the apparent successful offeror is a large business, they will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with separate percentage goals for using small business concerns.  To the fullest extent, the NPS welcomes the participation of small business firms, including women and minority-owned and operated A/E firms and encourages large business firms to include small business firms as part of their team. The North American Industry Classification Code is 54131.  A/E firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a Letter of Interest and completed Standard Form 254 and 255 to the NPS, Midwest Regional Office, Attention:  Contract Specialist Theora McVay, 1709 Jackson Street, Omaha, Nebraska  68102.

Supporting facilities include electric service, water, sewer, telephone, cable TV, security and street lighting, fire protecti on and alarm systems, paving walks, storm drainage, information systems, and site improvements.  Environmental landfill issues provide gas monitoring of a nearby closed landfill.  Site improvements include filling a sand borrow pit, removing WWII concrete range wall, and removal of buried tires, mattresses and other unknown debris.  Access for the handicapped will be provided in the headquarters buildings, into the first floor administrative area of the COF’s and the soldier community facilities.  Provide c omprehensive building and furnishings related interior design services.  Air Conditioning: 590 tons. Possible additional phase(s) are a continuation of the airfield master plan barracks complex.  Additional phase(s) include a three story 240 room unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing (UEPH) (approx. 88,000 GSF) facility with a built-in soldier communit y building (SCB), a multi-purpose ball field, one Battalion headquarters (approx. 19,000), ten Company Operating Facilities (COF) (ranging from approx. 6,500 to 10,000 GSF), and associated roadways, drives and parking.  Utilities (water sewer, electric and  gas) will consist mainly of lateral connections to the Roadways, or nearest service points.  The main utilities along new roadways or existing or programmed under an ongoing project.  In accordance with the new DA standards, junior enlisted barracks are a uthorized 34 GSM per PN, which includes soldier community areas.  Under new standard, space is taken from the SCB areas and allocated to the barracks rooms.  As a result, this provides additional living room space and meets the space criteria for E-5/6 per sonnel, justifying a single barrack room instead of two (under the old standard).  Therefore, the number of rooms equals the number of personnel. The barracks expansion for 1st brigade project includes three barrack buildings (2-story each) with 92 room unaccompanied enlisted personnel housing (UEPH) facilities with built-in soldier community facilities in the 10200 area.  Construction is to match t he architectural theme of adjacent buildings, which were constructed in 1987-1990.  Supporting facilities include parking, walkways, and utilities.  Under the new standard, living room space has been increased to approximately 13.7 square meters justifying  a single barrack room for E5/6s.  Therefore the number of rooms equals the number of personnel. Technical capability required:  A/E services for the preparationof a design build RFP to include plans, specifications, analysis, reports, and cost estimates. AE services to support the project during the design build phase.  Possible contaminated soil may be included. Topographic surveys and subsurface explorations will be included.

The solicitation was canceled by Amendment No. 1 dated 7/10/01 due to lack of response. Through this Sources Sought announcement, FHWA seeks comments on the program and the solicitation process in order to improve responses when FHWA re-issues the solicitation in the near future. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES: Under this project, the successful applicant will establish a Tribal Technical Assistance Program (TTAP) center to support California and Nevada. The objectives of the TTAP center are to perform the following: (1) Transfer transportation technology to American Indian tribal governments through training, technical assistance, and information access; (2) Improve communication on technical transportation issues among FHWA, BIA, state DOTs, tribal governments, cities, counties, and metropolitan and regional transportation organizations, including Metropolitan Planning Organizations and Regional Planning Organizations; (3) Assist in developing and implementing new transportation technologies and administrative procedures at the tribal level; (4) Provide tribal governments with training and technical assistance in Public Law 93-638 contracting and self-governance compacts; (5) Provide training and technical assistance in intergovernmental transportation planning, recreational travel and tourism, and related economic development; (6) Provide ongoing contact and communication with tribal staffs and elected officials. In cooperation with the FHWA and BIA, these objectives should be accomplished by providing tribal governments with transportation-related technology transfer materials and training, compiling and updating mailing lists of stakeholders, publishing a quarterly newsletter, and conducting an evaluation of the program?s effectiveness. The FHWA and BIA will cooperate with the center to provide national and tribal level information and data needed to support the TTAP objectives. The FHWA and BIA will furnish the TTAP center with selected technology transfer and training course materials and demonstrations of proven technologies. The BIA will provide program data in support of these technology transfer activities. The FHWA will operate the LTAP Clearinghouse to expand TTAP center access to technical materials. Documents and other technology transfer materials from the FHWA and BIA will be provided at no cost. The TTAP center may customize any of these materials to meet program objectives as needed. The information to be transferred will come primarily from the FHWA, BIA, State Departments of Transportation (DOTs), tribal departments of transportation, tribal governments, and the Intertribal Transportation Association. FINANCING: Financing for this project will be provided from two sources. The FHWA and the BIA will each contribute half of the funding for the center. A mandatory 10% cost-share is required. This cost-share requirement can be satisfied through in-kind contributions (such as donated labor hours, equipment, materials, etc.) from the applicant or from a third party. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA: The FHWA plans to use the following technical criteria in evaluating applications and selecting an organization for award: (1) Approach (soundness, adequacy and reasonableness of the technical approach to successfully achieve the program objectives); (2) Staffing (the qualifications of the proposed staffing to successfully achieve the program objectives); and (3) Knowledge and Experience (knowledge and experience to successfully achieve the program objectives, including knowledge of and experience with tribal governments having transportation responsibilities, the Indian Reservation Roads Program, the LTAP program, and technology transfer). REQUEST FOR SOURCES AND COMMENTS: Any interested organizations should submit information and comments in writing or by email by August 1, 2001, to Federal Highway Administration, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM) (Attn: Mr. Andre Sheppard, HAAM 20-C), Room 4410, 400 7th Street, SW, Washington DC 20590; Email Andre.Sheppard@FHWA.DOT.GOV.

<CONTACT>Brenda Burke, Contract Specialist, (703) 358- 2237 (phone); (703) 358-1875 (fax); email access  presently not available
<DESC>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is requesting information from firms interested in managing  the Federal Duck Stamp Licensing Program. This is a  Request for Information (RFI) only in order to solicit  comments and capability statement from potentially  interested firms. The USFWS has licensed the Federal  Duck Stamps on an array of duck stamp products such as  commemorative knives and clocks, and collectibles such  as lapel pins, t-shirts, caps, mugs, mouse pads, cotton  throws, calendars, checks, stained glass designs, etc.   The Federal Duck Stamp Licensed products are advertised  in a variety of major outdoor, hunting and conservation  catalogs (Ducks Unlimited) and sold at K-Mart, Wal-Mart,  J.C. Penneys and several military exchanges.  This  program presently generates between $80,000 to $120,000  in royalties per year.  Sales related royalties received  as a result of licensed products are deposited into the  Migratory Bird Conservation Fund and used by the USFWS  to acquire wetland habitat for North American Migratory  Waterfowl.  While the amounts shown above have been the  historical annual royalties, the objective of this  contract is to significantly expand the licensing  program and correspondingly the amount of royalties  generated.  The contractor’s task would include: (1)  managing the nationwide marketing of the Federal Duck  Stamp Licensed products which includes informing the  Chief, Federal Duck Stamp Branch, of licensed agreements  with commercial enterprises, industry associations and  conservation organizations and the execution of relevant  related contractual agreements; (2)  identifying  resources required to support program operations  including the administration of contracts, negotiating  royalties, developing marketing strategies, advertising  and monitoring executive licensing agreements; (3)  developing short and long range goals for marketing of  the Duck Stamp design; represent USFWS at National  Trade/Gift and Sporting Good shows and conferences which  will include working with top executives, Federal and  state government representatives, and other individuals  interested in the Licensing Program; (4) researching  ways to increase sales and distribution of licensed  products, acting as a liaison with the establishment of  Fulfillment Centers through corporate partners; (5)  organizing and developing an electronic or printed  catalog as an outreach marketing tool to educate the  public about the licensing program; (6) receiving,  reviewing, analyzing, and processing all licensing  product applications which includes obtaining approval  and signature of the Chief, Federal Duck Stamp Branch;  (7) drafting contractual language, negotiating terms and  conditions inclusive of financial transactions and  tracking the licensed product agreement from time of  application through preparation and signature of final  agreement, ensuring that files are kept current.  USFWS  proposes that payment to the contractor be made as a  percentage of the royalties received from sales. The  contract will include a base year plus option years.  Interested contractors should submit their capability  statement (especially Federal Licensing Programs),  business size, GSA Schedule Contract Number if  applicable, and any noteworthy marketing/managing  accomplishments to Brenda Burke, Contract Specialist,  U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Branch of Contracts, 4401  N. Fairfax Drive, Suite 212, Arlington, VA 22203, NLT  February 25, 2002.  Fax any questions to Brenda Burke at  (703) 358-1875.  In addition, vendors are encouraged to  comment on the proposed financing of this contract  (i.e., payment as a percentage of royalties versus  direct obligations).  This notice of intent is not a  Request for Proposal.  A determination by the Government  of how or if to proceed with this requirement based upon  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion  of the Government based on the Government’s needs and  requirements.

<SUBJECT>A -- Conduct of Multicenter Phase III Efficacy Trial of HSV Vaccine Against Genital Herpes Disease
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIAID-45250

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseses (NIAID) intends to negotiate a modification to its contract with St. Louis University, N01-AI-45250. This contract is a Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU) for evaluation of control measures against infectious diseases other than AIDS. Under this modification, NIAID plans to conduct a multicenter Phase III efficacy trial of HSV vaccine against genital herpes disease. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has developed and patented a candidate genital herpes vaccine (rgD-Alum/MPL) which has been evaluated with its own funds in a full clinical development path, including two Phase III efficacy trials. Through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) partnership with GSK, the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), NIAID, proposes to conduct a pivotal vaccine efficacy trial to prevent genital herpes disease in women.  The trial will enroll approximately 7,000 women and will take 4 years to complete.  GSK and NIAID will share equally in the costs of the trial.  

 The St. Louis VTEU will subcontract with approximately 15 other institutions to fulfill the required 7,000 subject enrollment.  As part of the CRADA negotiation, NIAID undertook a feasibility assessment for the conduct of this trial.  The outcome of this assessment was that between the 15 sites that participated, it was feasible to enroll the projected 7,000 eligible subjects.  These institutions are proposed as subcontractors to St. Louis University and they are as follows:  University of North Carolina, University of Texas Medical Branch, Baylor College of Medicine, UCLA, University of Rochester, University of Colorado, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Maryland, Louisiana State University School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, University of Utah, University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Washington. Each of these institutions has substantial infrastructure to support a clinical trial of this nature, and investigators with documented experience and expertise in vaccine evaluation, infectious disease and complex interventional clinical trials. 

The number of subjects needed in a recruitment time of 18 months demands a multicenter effort, an institutional management infrastructure to coordinate this effort, and a skilled Principal Investigator with documented experience and expertise in the conduct of multicenter vaccine efficacy trials.  The NIAID St. Louis VTEU fills the institutional management requirements and Dr. Robert Belshe, PI of this contract, has documented infectious disease training and experience, and extensive experience in the development and clinical evaluation of vaccines.  The St. Louis VTEU represents significant infrastructure that the Government has already secured and supported for many years.  St. Louis University has a relevant study population in the geographic environs and will contribute a significant number of the clinical trial subjects. As PI of the ST. Louis VTEU, Dr. Belshe has taken the lead in clinical protocol development and served as lead study clinician in regulatory meetings with the FDA. Through St. Louis University and the other subcontractors named above, known study populations are accessed.  If this clinical trial were competed, there would be wasteful and unnecessary duplication of costs to rebuild the infrastructure we already have in place.  As part of the CRADA negotiations, the government committed to begin subject enrollment by July 2002.  This can only be accomplished by working with existing and known material and personnel infrastructure.  To do anything other than this will severely impact on time and cost and will result in unacceptable CRADA contractual delays. 

Authority:	41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. See numbered Note 22. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando Florida is interested in finding local training sources capable of providing  fire fighting training to Navy personnel in the Seattle/Everett, WA region/area.  The following types of training are required.   1) General Shipboard Fire fighting (J-495-0412) - a one day course with 10 convenings/year.  This course is to familiarize officers and enlisted personnel with shipboard fire-fighting systems, procedures and equipment.  The scope includes proper techniques and procedures for general shipboard fire fighting.  Classes of fires covered under the instruction include Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie fires and fires involving conventional weapons.   The duties of oxygen breathing apparatusmen, nozzlemen, hosemen, plugmen, accessmen, and portable extinguisher supplymen are also addressed.  2) Shipboard Fire fighting Team Training (J-495-0418) - a one day course, with 26 convenings/year (every other week) - This course is to exercise an experienced, organized emergency detail.  Team members will have to effectively operate as a unit to combat shipboard emergencies involving class Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie fires.  The scope of this course is to exercise team members in duties as On-Scene Leader, Team Leader, Investigator, nozzleman, hoseman, accessman, and plugman.  The course should measure the teams' ability to: (a) comprehend and apply fire fighting principles, rules and concepts, and (b) to solve problems and perform assigned tasks when combating live fires, using standard Navy fire fighting equipment.  3) Advanced Shipboard Fire Fighting Training (J-495-0419), a 4-day course, with 4 convenings/year (once a quarter).  This course is to train supervisory fire party personnel in advanced techniques in fire fighting and proper management of on-scene personnel.  This course includes hands-on training for fire party members including Repair Locker Leader, Scene Leader, Investigator, Nozzleman, Hoseman, Plugman, Agent Supply Man, Accessman, Compartment Tester, and Plotter.  The contractor will be able to provide training in limited visibility scenarios utilizing smoke generation. The course may be a Government-approved vendor?s standard, non-modified course or a Government furnished course tailored to the vendor?s instructional methods and strategies. The Government will provide Standard Processes for Homeport Training, lesson outlines, instructor guides, student guides, special student handouts, and course tests.  Navy envisions that this would be turn-key training, that is the contractor shall provide all training facilities, equipment not provided by the Navy, consumables,  round trip transportation from Everett , hot meal services, male and female changing rooms, audiovisual and consumable supplies (pencils, paper, chalk, erasers, etc.) for students' use, and laundry facilities for fire fighting ensembles. Facilities should be able to accommodate a minimum of 25 students and be located within one-hour drive from the Everett Naval Base Everett, WA. Vendor classroom facilities should be of adequate size/space to conduct the training and have acceptable environmental conditions (heat/air) normally found in an academic setting, utilities, and support to ensure undistracted and productive training. Safety in all training events shall be paramount.  The contractor shall comply with applicable National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and OSHA safety instructions and standards governing fire-fighting training.  Additionally, the facility shall include an emergency broadcast signal, adequate ventilation, emergency water supply, emergency extinguishing system, egress routes, and adequate structural integrity and safety.  The vendor shall dispose of expended Oxygen Breathing Apparatus (OBA) canisters in accordance with applicable local, state, and Federal environmental regulations.  Training shall normally be conducted on an eight-instructional-hour day (early, evening, or night shift) plus one hour for lunch, and normally scheduled between Monday and Friday (excluding Government Holidays), for the length of the course.   However, emergency situations may require weekend training, which would be negotiated with the Local Training Authority (LTA) located at Trident Training Facility, Bangor, WA. Remediation training should be considered beyond the normal 8 hour a day training time for each class.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INDICATION THAT THE NAVY WILL CONTRACT FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. NAWCTSD will not pay for information received in response to this RFI. This is a market research tool, seeking innovative business solutions and training approaches. This information will be used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to the issuance of any future Request for Proposal (RFP). Interested parties are to submit a capability statement indicating if their facility, instructor resources and processes can meet the above requirements.  Statement may indicate alternative approaches. Further, provide a company profile including name, address, Point of Contact, and indicate the business size, i.e., large or small. If small, denote any qualifications as a Small Emerging Business or as a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) and provide any certifications regarding HUBZone.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM) has a requirement to procure three non-developmental changes to the CH-47D Flight Simulator located at Camp Humphries, Korea.  It is the intent that these changes will be awarded to the L3 Communications, Link Simulation and Training.  These changes will be incorporated as a modification to Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Contract N61339-99-C-0046 - EUSA Korea Upgrade. 

The three changes, upgrades T55-GA-714A Engine (w/FADEC), Engine Air Particle Separator, and Night Vision Compatibility, will require the necessary hardware and software fabrication, integration, testing, installation, and document changes to the baseline CH-47D Flight Simulator located at Camp Humphries, Korea.  All efforts shall be performed in accordance with Statement of Work EUSA CH-47D ECP SOW -001 dated 15 June 2000. 

This effort will also include the procurement of all required testing, operator/ maintainer training, spare/repair parts, tools and test equipment, and contractor logistic support. 

It is essential for mission accomplishment that the training system changes be fielded concurrently with the changes to the actual tactical equipment.   Due to the date of fielding of the tactical equipment, the required delivery of these FS modifications is 30 August 2002.  This will require that production start as soon as possible.  As the original developer and the current provider of the CH-47D trainer upgrades, and the provider of the same three trainer modifications to the CH-47D trainer at Fort Campbell, KY; L3-Communications is the only known source that possesses the required knowledge, data, and software necessary to meet the requisite delivery date.  

This is not a request for proposal.  No RFP is available!

<DESC>SAIC Frederick Inc., Operations and Technical Support Contractor for the National Cancer Institute at Frederick (NCI-Frederick) under Contract number NO1-CO-12400 requires the following services in association with the demolition of Building 470 on the NCI-Frederick campus at Fort Detrick, Maryland: engineering and design; demolition planning; demolition; waste management and debris removal, hazardous materials monitoring and remediation of the demolition site. 

The project is currently planned in two phases, Phase I shall be the design and demolition planning followed by Phase II, the actual building demolition and debris removal and disposal and restoration of the site and adjacent buildings.  Both phases have the potential for the selected contractor to support public relations activities. 

Building 470 is a 39,000 square foot, 7-story industrial building, with a steel-framed structure and a brick and masonry skin.  It was built by the Department of Defense in 1952, and has not been occupied since the early 1970s.  Before the building was transferred to Department of Health and Human Services, it was decontaminated by the Department of the Army.  Extensive and repeated sampling throughout the building has shown no evidence of residual hazard from research performed there.  Two, two-story buildings (431 and 469) adjoin building 470 on two sides.  Building 470 is located in close proximity to other occupied structures. 

Phase I of this contract will involve, at minimum, the following tasks: study of the impact of Building 470 demolition activities on the performance of laboratory activities and equipment in adjacent buildings; definitions of the type and extent of hazardous material monitoring required; structural impact to the adjoining buildings and required renovations; development of plans and fair-cost estimate for remediation of the demolition site; development of demolition plans and cost estimates; and public relations planning support.
	
Phase II will include: the demolition and disposal of the Building 470 structure and contents; site remediation and filling the resulting excavation; construction of an asphalt parking lot over the existing excavation; repairs as required for adjacent structures; and support for the public relations activities. 

The method of contracting to perform this project may include both phases as a turnkey contract.  This decision will be based on SAIC Frederick and NCI's management assessment of the capability of qualified contractors to plan and perform this project with a credible fixed price.  If the decision is made to award this contract in two phases, the Phase I contractor will provide management, engineering and public relations services related to the Phase II demolition phase. Under these conditions, Phase II activities, including demolition and remediation, will be conducted under a fixed-price contract. 

This announcement is intended to identify qualified companies that can perform either Phase I or Phase II or Phases I and II.

From the information provided in response to this request, SAIC Frederick, together with the NCI, will select contractors qualified to bid.  Selected contractors will be invited to present their qualifications to a selection board.

<SUBJECT>--Workshop for Discussion of future NPS Vehicle Designs for Bus and Transit Vehicle Manufacturers (NAICS Codes 336110 and 336112)
<DESC>NA As part of the implementation of new Alternative Transportation Systems (buses, trams, trolleys, etc.) in national parks, the NPS will hold a vehicle design workshop to discuss readily-implementable design concepts for NPS vehicles for the future. It is the hope of the NPS that these concepts can feasibly be accommodated by modifying current production vehicles.  The NPS anticipates that it will ultimately procure these modified vehicles   using applicable Federal procurement procedures.  The objectives for these new vehicles include: 1) minimizing any impact on natural and cultural resources; 2) enhancing the visitor experience; and 3) promoting the NPS image through vehicle design.  Concepts for transit vehicles will be discussed according to the following categories in breakout sessions : 1) small buses; 2) medium buses; 3) large buses; 4) shuttles and trams; and 5) other vehicles.  The goal of this Workshop is to begin the process to define a realistic and consistent set of design concepts for Park Service vehicles that will be analyzed by the NPS at a later time, and then widely distributed throughout the parks and industry for review and comment.  Vehicle design and manufacturing Iindustry representatives are invited to participate in this conference, on a first-come-first-serve basis, through prior registration as defined below.  This is not a marketing opportunity, but rather a limited opportunity to listen to and comment on vehicle needs as presented by the NPS.  There will be no opportunity for manufacturers or concessionaires to distribute literature or make prese ntations about a company or its products during plenary, general or breakout sessions.  A set of Guidelines will be provided to industry workshop participants to assure the NPS meets its meeting objectives and does not violate any federal procurement laws or regulations.  The guidelines will address such issues as: 1) prohibitions on product promotion & advertising;  2) session participation; and 3) adherence to session rules and facilitator directions.  There will not be any opportunity for manufacturers or concessionaires to distribute literature or make presentations about a company or its products during plenary, general or breakout sessions. A fee will be charged to cover meals, light refreshments and other costs.  Industry representatives may participate on a first-come-first-serve b asis by submitting a written response (and/or email) to Barry Mickela at the Volpe Center (see address information below) identifying the individual(s) who will attend on behalf of your firm, the professional background and expertise (e.g., vehicle design, vehicle manufacture, understanding of Park Service requirements) of each attendee, and the breakout session(s) each of your representatives would like to attend. Only one representative per company per breakout session will be accepted.  Only completed written responses will be accepted. Written responses may be submitted using the various forms of delivery, including e-mail.  , and the total industry participation will be limited to  fifty (50 participants. The total industry participation will be limited to forty (40) participants. The  NPS will restrict attendance for at each breakout session to no more than twelve (12) total industry participants.  Participation in breakout sessions will also generally be on a first-come, first-served basis. However, the government NPS reserves the right to invite additional participants to a particular breakout session and/or to limit participation in order to assure a variety of expertise and backgrounds are represented.  In addition, breakout session topics may be merged or eliminated at the sole discretion of the NPS.  The NPS also reserves the right to may further restrict overall attendance at this conference due to facility constraints and/or government participation.  Only completed expressions of interest will be accepted.

Title:	System And Method For Privilege Management Of Mobile Agents
Description:   	A general-purpose mechanism is described for controlling the behavior of
mobile agent-system entities, both human and software, through allocation of privileges.  Privileges refer to policy rules that govern the access and utilization of computational resources and services.  The invention is based on the capability of most mobile agent systems to extend the platform processing environment and the use of two forms of privilege management certificates: attribute certificates and policy certificates.  Privilege management certificates are digitally signed objects that allow various policy setting principles to govern the activities of mobile agents through selective privilege assignment.  The invention overcomes a number of problems in existing agents systems and provides a means for attaining improved interoperability of agent systems designed and implemented independently by different manufacturers.
NIST DOCKET NUMBER: 01-030PA2
Title:	Minimizing Spatial-dispersion-induced Birefringence in Crystals Used For Precision Optics By Using Mixed Crystals of Materials With the Opposite Sign of the Birefringence
Description:	The intrinsic birefringences we recently discovered, by measurement and calculation, in CaF2 and BaF2 crystals present serious problems for use of these crystalline materials for precision optics in the ultraviolet (UV), e.g., for UV optical lithography.  Since we found the intrinsic birefringences of CaF2 and BaF2 have opposite sign, we propose a correction solution in which a mixed crystal Ca1-xBaxF2 is made which effectively zeroes out the birefringence of the crystal at a given wavelength, for an appropriately chose value of x.  The appropriate x value is determined approximately by the mixture where the linearly interpolated birefringence goes to zero.  Our calculations indicate the SrF2 has a birefringence that is also opposite in sign to that of CaF2.  In this case a mixed crystal Ca1-xSrxF2 could also have zero birefringence.  Optical components such as lenses and beam splitters could be made of these mixed crystals that would be free of intrinsic birefringence aberrations at a chosen wavelength.  These could be used as components of precision optical systems at this wavelength, such as optical photolithography projection systems.

<SUBJECT>18 -- DISTINGUISHED SPACE INDUSTRY FELLOWS PROGRAM
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS) is seeking input from private industry to support acquisition planning for the FY 2003 Distinguished Space Industry Fellows Program, which commences October 2002.  The information received in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will assist AFRL/VS to identify technical topics in which private industry has an interest in establishing collaborative, on-site cost-share research or other technical presence through participation in the Distinguished Space Industry Fellows Program (DSIF).  The DSIF Program is offered by AFRL/VS to facilitate long-term and improved understanding between the government space technology community, private industry, academia, and other government organizations.  The DSIF Program invites scientists and other technical experts from industry to participate through a competitive selection process to conduct specific, pre-negotiated, technology research or developmental efforts at an AFRL/VS facility for a period of one year.  The scientific studies and experimentation undertaken by DSIF Fellows are directed toward advancing state-of-the-art in specific space technologies and is not related to the development of a specific weapon system or a specific hardware development effort.  A DSIF Fellow remains a company employee of his or her sponsoring organization while participating in this program and returns to the company at the end of a one-year tenure. The DSIF Program potentially offers technical interchange opportunities.  This interchange includes visits to facilities of other government and non-government members of the space technology community for the purpose of providing the DSIF Fellows with insight into technology priorities of the government space technology enterprise.  In response to this RFI, private industry may suggest opportunities for technical interchange visits intended to further the objectives of fostering future AFRL, industry, academia, and other government and non-government laboratory collaboration and partnership building.  AFRL/VS topics that may be of interest to companies considering nomination of one or more of their employees for participation in the FY 2003 DSIF program include, but are not limited to the following.  Respondents to this RFI are invited to suggest additional topics:  
Space Computing and Sensing -- the broad application of computational devices and sensors to space systems including microelectronics, nanoelectronics and nanotechnology, sensors/detectors, optics (including deformable optics, inflatable optics, and optical correction), MEMs, mixed-signal circuitry, reconfigurable/adaptive/self-repairing circuits, the software that controls [re]configuration and operation,  advanced packaging concepts for space applications, tracking; related radiation effects; related simulation and modeling; and radiation effects mitigation on space computing and optical devices;
