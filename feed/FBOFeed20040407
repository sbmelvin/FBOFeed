<DESC>PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT Pre Solicitation Notice  General Financial/Accounting Support Services  This public announcement is a Pre-Solicitation notice of an upcoming requirement for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC).  The projected requirement is for General Financial/Accounting Support Services in support of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center's, Office of Financial Operations.  The contracting officer has made a determination this requirement will be 100% set-aside for Small and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) 8(a) vendors only.  The FAA is consolidating its regional accounting functions to the MMAC, Oklahoma City.  The projected requirements are needed to support this consolidation of accounting functions and provide general financial and accounting services required at the Aeronautical Center.  It may also be used to support the Transportation Safety Administration's (TSA) payroll services (currently approximately 125 positions).  The Aeronautical Center's responsibility for processing the TSA payroll services are schedule to end October 1, 2004 but at this time, there has been no replacement identified and as such, it is estimated that these services may be required for at least an additional year, or until such time as TSA can take over the responsibility for providing these services.  The projected date of issuance of the solicitation is mid-May 2004.  Any resulting contract is estimated to have a start date of October 1, 2004.  Under this requirement, the contractor shall provide fully trained and qualified personnel as necessary to perform the financial and accounting support services related to administrative/budget support, accounting support, financial support services, and payroll administration.  The contractor will be responsible for the supervision of all contractor support personnel under this requirement and will be required to have supervisory personnel on site at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541211, Offices of Certified Public Accountants, with a size standard of is $7 million (based on Annual Receipts â€“ Gross receipts are averaged over a firmâ€™s latest 3 completed fiscal years to determine its average annual receipts. â€œReceiptsâ€ means the firmâ€™s gross or total income, plus cost of goods sold, as defined by or reported on the firmâ€™s Federal Income Tax return.)  The Solicitation and any resulting contract is projected to be for a one-year base period with options to extend services for an additional four one-year periods.   The contracting officer, in accordance with the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS) section 3.6.1.3.4, titled "Competitive Set-Asides to Small Businesses Owned and Controlled by Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Individuals," which states, "individual procurements may be set-aside exclusively for competitive award among Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are expressly certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program at the time of release of the initial screening information request (SIR) or public announcement."  This requirement has been 100% set-aside for Small and Economically Disadvantaged Businesses (SEDBs) that are certified under the 8(a) program through the SBA.  Only those sources that can provide the Small Business Administration certification letter will be considered for award.  This letter will be required to be included with the vendors proposal.  Proposal due date will be announded in the SIR at a later date.  This requirement is further limited to only those 8(a) vendors located within the boundaries of the State of Oklahoma.  All teaming arrangement will be subject to the AMS Clause 3.6.1-7  Limitations on Subcontracting.   Estimates of the requirement are changing due to possible loss of the TSA Payroll function and the impact of consolidation of all FAA Regional accounting function to MMAC over the next two years has made the estimated number of positions hard to identify.  Because of the unknowns, numbers are estimated on a yearly basis to range from 75 to 120 positions per year to 175 to 225 positions per year.  Support services required under this requirement may include but are not limited to the following labor categories: General Clerk I â€“ General Clerk II â€“ General Clerk III â€“ Payroll Technician III--Payroll Technician IVâ€“ Accounting Clerk IIIâ€“ Accounting Clerk IV â€“ General Accountant I â€“General Accountant II â€“ other labor categories may be added at the time of solicitation.

The requirement is to provide project/network management support of the Hickam Base Area Network (HBAN) and Classified Base Area Network (CBAN) for system operations and maintenance of the Hickam AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) infrastructure of the remote management and administration of the Pacific Air Forces Commander for the Pacific Air Forces (PACAFs) Enterprise of Responsibility (EOR).  The scope of this requirement also includes help desk/event management operations for the PACAF EOR.  In addition, this requirement covers travel to support remote site (theater bases) locations, as required.  The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).  The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 (21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from www.eps.gov, as no paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The Government contemplates award of this requirement on or about 15 August 2004, with a performance start date of 01 October 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. A DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

Request for Construction Documents Exhibit Solicitation 
GS-04P-04-CXC-0027
DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information. SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors. 
Note: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients. 
Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:


Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: 

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.


2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.


4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.


The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.


I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTD) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications.  The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.

Proposals must meet the Mandatory Qualification Criterion at the time of submission of initial proposals. As a minimum requirement, the contractors must perform all toxicology studies in accord with the FDA's current Good Laboratory Practice Regulations (GLPs).  Contractors must also indicate their willingness to sign a confidentiality of information statement.  Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment  managed basis.  Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement completion" contracts resulting from this solicitation.  Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually per contract.  Offerors are required to propose both levels of effort (64,015 and 127,960 hours over a 7 year period) .The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents, dogs, non-human primates (NHPs) and other animal models including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in animal models treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.

The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals.  The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist  and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials which illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.

The government anticipates multiple awards on a incremental funded basis.  Each increment will be for one year and the total contract will be awarded for a seven year period on or about February 28, 2004. All responsible offerors will be considered.   The solicitation is scheduled for electronic release approximately July 17, 2003.  The proposals will be due approximately 60 days following the actual date of RFP issuance.  The RFP may be accessed through the Research Contracts Branch Home Page by using the following internet address: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov It's the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of contact: Diane Stalder, Contract Specialist at e-mail: ds88b@nih.gov; FAX: 301-402-6699; Telephone: 301-435-3822.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Coherent Laser Group, 1251 S. Gaylord Street, Denver CO 80210 for a continuous wave, high power (>+6W), single-frequency, narrow linewidth, 532 nm wavelength laser. The applications for this laser are (1) pumping a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser and (2) performing Raman spectroscopy. Efficient pumping of the Ti:Sapphire laser requires that the pump laser beam has a TEM00 output mode with M2<1.1. In order to achieve stable mode locking from the femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser, the 532 nm pump laser must have low noise. The requirements for this are a power stability of better than 1% and overall noise of less than 0.05% measured over a frequency range of 10 Hz- 1 GHz. Spectroscopy applications require single-frequency (i.e. single-longitudinal-mode) operation.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) has a requirement for support to operate, maintain, and enhance the AIRNow Data Management Center (DMC).  The AIRNow program has grown from its nascence in 1997 as an ozone mapping system encompassing the northeastern United States to a nation-wide air quality mapping and forecasting program.  AIRNow receives data from over 1,500 monitoring sites, generates hourly map animations, collects air quality forecasts from more than 300 cities, and disseminates information to major weather service providers, including media companies, USA Today, and The Weather Channel.  These air quality maps and forecasts enable State and local governments to inform the public of possible health impacts and voluntary participation in emission reduction programs (e.g., ozone action days). This effort includes performing customer and technical support; conducting technical and data analyses, air quality forecasting support and training; and technical meeting support related to the AIRNow and Air Quality Index (AQI) programs which involve several Federal Agencies, numerous State and local air quality agencies and media partners.  Additional requirements include, but are not limited to, supporting the State Host Computer (SHC) network and related information transfer systems; obtaining, processing and storing air quality data delivered from the SHC network on scheduled basis; maintaining master air quality monitoring station location data table and other agency/system parameters; generation of contour map of ozone concentrations (static and animated) using existing EPA mapping tool or recommended and accepted software; providing support to and coordination of weather service providers and media partners; producing data products for the Weather Service Providers (WSPs) in GRIB format or customer specified format; recommending improvements to the overall AIRNow program, DMC, and products; updating the AIRNow Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to reflect new operations, and provide EPA with current documentation; setting up methods to automatically replicate the AIRNow system; monitoring AIRNNow DMC operations seven (7) days per week/365 days per ear;  identifying problems or outages and notify appropriate agencies; processing and reviewing air quality forecasts issued by each agency; providing forecasting support for the 36 USA Today cities; providing telephone support and communication to USA Today and other media partners and customers, as needed; producing EPA and AIRNow customer AQI forecast products; providing AQI marketing support, product development and educational training to stakeholders; and, perform and provide studies and reports.  EPA anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee level of effort contract for a total of 92,500 labor hours consisting of a Base requirement of 13,500 hours, Option Period I - 16,000 hours, Option Period II - 18,500 hours, Option Period III - 21,000 hours, and Option Period IV - 23,500 hours. NAICS Code 541990 applies with a size standard of $6M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  This is a similar requirement to Contract GS-10F-0181K, Task Order #1306 with Sonoma Technology, Inc.  The solicitation is expected to be issued approximately April 30, 2004 as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.   The solicitation and amendments will be available via the Internet World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via Internet.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL), located in Cincinnati, OH, on a sole source basis with the University of Wisconsin under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1 to conduct a study to determine the behavior and fate of infectious chronic wasting disease (CWD) prions during passage through wastewater treatment and sludge processing trains of wastewater treatment facilities. The wastewater treatment facilities of primary interest in this project are publically owned treatment works (POTWs) and septic systems.  The fate of CWD prions in POTWs will be determined by (1) the degree to which they partition to biotic and/or abiotic sludge particulate matter, (2) biological (enzymatic) degradation or compositional alteration by microorganisms (either aerobic or anaerobic), and (3) transport out of the system in  the treated effluent or processed sludge or by aerosolization during activated sludge aeration. Specifically, the contractor shall: (1) develop and optimize methods to detect CWD prions in wastewater and sludges and to recover and quantify same, (2) determine the extent to which CWD prions are  removed from suspension by sortion to or agglomeration or entrainment in settling sludges, both primary sludges and activated sludge flocs, (3) evaluate the capacity of sludges to degrade CWD prions under batch conditions, and (4) quantify the concentration and mass fraction of CWD prions exiting a  simulated activated sludge POTW in liquid effluent.   This notice is not a request for quotations.  EPA source research indicates the University of Wisconsin is the only known contractor with the appropriate level of technical knowledge necessary to complete this project. The University has a  unique research group comprised of varied disciplines that brings together the needed expertise to conduct this project including veterinary medicine, soil science, and wastewater treatment.  It is the only known research institution with facilities that have an acceptable safety protocol for  conducting engineering studies using prions. Moreover, the University has ongoing work to develop the analytical methodologies for detecting prions in the environment. They have also synthesized the only labeled prion available that will allow for their detection in the environment outside of  infected animal tissue. In sum, the University of Wisconsin has the unique capabilities of combining the expertise and the facilities necessary to conduct this research on the fate and transport of prions in wastewater treatment systems. No other known source has the combined advantage of the  expertise, the facilities, the access to the process, and the capability to complete such a sophisticated project. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing such a project. Such documentation  must be submitted by 3:00 PM EST Thursday, April 22, 2004. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to  conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710. Interested parties should submit their technical documentation to Mr. Josh Bowers, using the  following methods: by fax to 513.487.2109, or by email (bowers.joshua@epa.gov) referencing solicitation RFQ-OH-04-00082.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-CBX123
<ARCHDATE>04302004
<CONTACT>Janice Washington, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-325-9625, Fax 703-325-7560, Email janice.washington@dtra.mil - Herbert Thompson, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-325-6627, Fax 703-325-9295, Email herbert.thompson@dtra.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense's (DoD) Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBDP) intends to award funds to Chemical Biological Defense projects across the range of military operations that fulfill identified capability needs associated with warfighting missions and in support of CB force protection. The total amount of funds available is $23M. However, the goal is to award multiple contracts (7-10). Contract Period of Performance is expected to be a maximum of 2 years from date of contract award.  The estimated BAA release date is 22 April 2004.

The Defense Threat Reduction Agency – Chemical Biological (DTRA-CB) Directorate is requesting organizations (commercial, academic, non-profit, etc.) conducting advanced technology research and development in the chemical and biological defense arena to respond to the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Proposed technologies for this BAA should be sufficiently mature to achieve Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 4-6 for non-medical efforts or TRLs 4-5 for medical efforts at the successful completion of the contracted work.  Non-medical efforts are not intended to be a proof of concept to determine whether separate components of a technology are viable, though it may validate a breadboard design, test the viability of a new application for a demonstrated technology through technology demonstrations, Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrations, or a Joint Warfighter Experiment. The technology development should result in a demonstration of the component or system in a relevant environment.  For medical systems, a successful effort will, at a minimum, demonstrate a proof of concept of the proposed technology in an appropriate animal model or other relevant paradigm.  Clinical trials, phases 1-3, are beyond the technical maturity being considered under this BAA.

White papers/Quad charts and proposals should be limited to research and development that demonstrates quantifiable improvements in the following areas as: integrated early warning (early warning/standoff CB detection and standoff/remote surveillance/reconnaissance), installation/ force protection (BW agent identification and confirmation, next generation BW aerosol detection, force protection/installation decision support tools and sensitive equipment and interior decontamination), medical countermeasures (integrated diagnostic networks, CB warfare agent prophylaxis, and refractory nerve agent treatment) and individual/collective protection (prolonged filter shelf-life, Toxic Industrial Material filtration, defacto collective protection, selectively permeable materials, personal cooling systems, and improved closures for protective ensembles).

A two-phased proposal selection process will be employed for this solicitation. Phase I will consist of the solicitation, receipt and evaluation of a one-page Summary Quad Chart  and a White Paper described in the BAA. The White Paper shall include supporting information for data submitted in the summary Quad Chart and shall describe the capability gap addressed, provide a more detailed proposed technology, identify deliverables, describe work to be performed, describe the offeror’s expertise to effect the proposed solution, and present estimated costs and schedule. Phase II will consist of a solicitation of a full proposal resulting from favorable Quad Chart/White Paper evaluations. 

This solicitation will only be released and available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Accordingly, no written, telephonic, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpss.gov website for any solicitation amendments.  All questions concerning this requirement shall be addressed directly to the contractual point of contact at janice.washington@dtra.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>07302005
<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>UPDATE (4-05-04) ANNOUNCEMENT OF FORMAL SOURCES SOUGHT This notification announces the commencement of a formal Sources Sought for the  T-38C Escape System Upgrade Program (ESUP), Solicitation No. FA8617-04-R-6154.   The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine whether there are additional  offerors interested in this program and to finalize the Government+s pre- solicitation market research.  As part of this acquisition, the Government  intends to upgrade the current T-38C escape system including the aircraft’s  ejection seats and inter-seat sequencing, as well as escape path clearance.   The Government plans to upgrade a minimum of 199 aircraft, but may upgrade up  to 509 aircraft.  Formal technical performance parameters will be released with  the draft RFP.  Please review previous announcements and attachments for  additional background information (posted below, if using the PIXS website, or  available on the FedBizOpps website).    Offerors who responded to previous Requests for Information (RFIs), dated 06  Mar 2002, 3 Oct 2003, and 9 Jan 2004, or attended either of the two Industry  Days held on 29 Sep 2003 and 9 Mar 2004 need not respond to this notification.   Only unidentified offerors who have not previously responded nor participated  to date should submit a letter of interest to the Government at this time.  The  Government also requests that you respond to the questions posed in the RFIs  dated 3 Oct 2003 and 9 Feb 2004 as part of your submission.  Interested parties  are requested to submit a letter of interest via email or hard copy to the  individual listed below no later than 20 Apr 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  In  addition, the Government requests that the responses to the RFIs be provided  via email or hard copy no later than 5 May 2004 at 3:00 pm local time.  This  sources sought notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals and no  contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Important  Reminder:  Again, letters of interest and RFI responses are not required from  those who have previously responded to the RFIs or have attended the Industry  Days.   Please direct any questions regarding your status as an offeror or any other  aspect of this program to the individual listed below.   Discussions with Industry conducted through previous RFIs and Industry Days  have aided the Government in the development of its current acquisition  strategy.  The current strategy is to compete the T-38 ESUP program as a  nondevelopmental item (NDI) acquisition to the maximum extent practicable,  using a FAR Part 15, Full Trade-Off (FTO), best value, competitive source  selection.  If the acquisition strategy changes or evolves differently,  Industry will be notified accordingly. The Government anticipates posting a draft solicitation within the next 60-90  days for the T-38 ESUP acquisition.  Comments from Industry on the draft  version will be solicited at that time to aid in the preparation and release of  the final request for proposal.  Please monitor the PIXS website and FedBizOpps  (www.fbo.gov) for further updates.

The  Government anticipates conducting another Industry Day on the 9th of March in  Bldg 570, Rm. 102 located on the premises of Wright-Patterson AFB, beginning at  8:30 a.m. (EST).  This will be Industry’s opportunity to meet with Government  representatives and to understand how the Government will measure  anthropometrical values once escape system components are installed in the T- 38C mock forebody located at Wright-Patterson AFB.  This meeting will also  provide Industry and the Government an opportunity to discuss program  developments up to this point.   This is also a call for industry to schedule appointments to see the T-38C mock  forebody in a one-on-one environment with the personnel who will conduct the  anthropometrical analysis of submitted systems.  There will be six half-day  appointments available beginning Wednesday, the 10th and ending Friday the 12th  of March, 2004.  Each half-day session will be scheduled on a first-come, first- serve basis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program will be  given. An open forum of question and answers will follow this portion.   Attendees must indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 13 Feb 04 to  Capt Jay Kilpatrick Program Manager, 1970 Monahan Way, Bldg 11A, Room 201-1,  WPAFB, Ohio 45433-7211.  The Government limits attendance to no more than 3  persons per interested party.   How to contact this program: POC:  Capt Jay Kilpatrick (Program Manager), 937-904-4317, Ms Sally Meyer  (PCO), 937-904-4304 ////END OF UPDATE//// UPDATE (01-09-04) POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INCLUSION OF ESCAPE PATH CLEARANCE SUB-SYSTEM IN FIRST  ITERATION During our recent Industry Day, as well as in subsequent T-38 ESUP RFI  responses, a phased approach was suggested as a suitable acquisition strategy  for the ESUP.  We are strongly considering such an approach, but would value  your inputs as we formulate such a program.   One consideration is how to “segment/phase” the program.  In particular, we are  evaluating the benefits of not including the upgraded escape path clearance sub- system from the first phase.  It’s the governments position an upgraded escape  path clearance sub-system presents the greatest technical and schedule risk  over a replacement seat or inter-seat sequencing sub-system.   The Government will not define a design solution for the escape path clearance  sub-system. We will require its performance to be such that it will allow the  overall ejection sequence timing to be kept as low as possible so that we get  maximum system capability from replacement seats. Question:  What do you foresee as the schedule impact of including an improved  escape path clearance sub-system in a first phase of the ESUP?  Please provide  your answer as a function of total system design/development/qualification,  specifying to the greatest extent possible the issues you see as of greatest  concern. Request your response be submitted NLT February 9, 2004 to: ASC/YTA, Capt. E.

Both the time and the location have been determined as follows: We will be holding this conference on Monday, September 29th, 2003 from 1:00pm  to 5:00pm (Eastern Standard Time).  We will be meeting at the Ervin J. Nutter  Center in the "Berry Room" conference facility.  It is located within the  Nutter Center at 3640 Colonel Glenn Highway in Dayton, Ohio, 45435-0001, USA.   This link, http://www.nuttercenter.com/berry/index.html, should provide more  information about the conference center.  A tentative agenda and information on  local accomodations is attached.   /////UPDATE END///// The T-38 Flight Training System Program Office (ASC/YTA) of the Aeronautical  Systems Center is analyzing and assessing industry capabilities to provide an  upgrade to the current T-38C escape system to include the aircraft’s ejection  seats, escape path clearance, inter-seat sequencing, as well as the physical  accommodation of a greater range of aircrew personnel.  The Government  anticipates conducting the first Industry Day on 29 Sep 2003 (specific time and  location to be determined).  This will be Industry’s initial opportunity to  meet with cognizant Government representatives and to discuss the known  requirements and intent of the T-38 ESUP.  We are actively seeking Industry’s  inputs in helping us develop the acquisition strategy for this program.  Due to  size limitations, no more than three (3) representatives per company may attend  this meeting. A simulated T-38C cockpit, to be located at AFRL, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH,  will be available to Industry for inspections, measurements, etc. to aid in  Industry’s partnership with the Government in developing the acquisition  strategy.  The modified cockpit mock-up will be available to Industry  approximately late October/November 2003.  Companies interested in obtaining  access to the mock-up must request this in writing through the individuals  listed at the end of this synopsis. At the Industry Day, a briefing on the current status of the program and the  results of a recent Air Force Research Laboratory anthropometrical study on the  T-38C aircraft will be given. This will be followed by an “open forum” of  question and answers.  Following the open forum, Industry representatives may  individually engage with Government representatives for appointments (one hour  or less) to present their capabilities and concepts.  Maximum leverage  of “available technology” in any technical approach is highly encouraged.  This  is the initial step to establish industry’s understanding of the T-38 ESUP and  to allow the Government to determine market capabilities. Attendees must  indicate their interest in attending by letter NLT 10 Sep 03 via the  individuals listed at the end of this synopsis.  Similarly, if you are  interested in having access to the T-38 cockpit mock-up please provide your  request, in writing, to the listed individuals contained at the conclusion of  this synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this RFI and notification.  Submitting capabilities  and concepts in response to this RFI is voluntary and participants will not be  compensated.

<CONTACT>Beth Chapman, 757-878-0009
<DESC>The Special Operations Directorate of the US Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM) has a requirement for improved heavy lift engines to enhance aircraft capability and safety, as well as reduce risk for all mission profiles for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) MH-60 fleet.  The engine is expected to be a Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) 2,500 shaft horsepower turbine engine with Civil Certification or Military Qualification that will drop in the current airframe with minimal mo dification to the structure.  Key characteristics of the new engine include:  (1) improved power reserves over current engines, (2) providing for mission power requirements in hot weather at high altitude, (3) improved fuel economy over current engines, (4 ) engines and accessories shall be modular, fault tolerant and capable of accepting future upgrades, and (5) minimal maintenance requirements.  To optimize the engine delivery schedule with the revised MH60 modification line and to align the acquisition wi th programmed funding, the acquisition has been restructured.  As part of this procurement, the selected contractor shall deliver one engine mockup, the non-recurring engineering (NRE) for the MH-60 specific modifications, test validation, 8 instrumented f light test engines, flight test support, flight test logistics support, and aircraft integration support.  Included in the contract will be options as follows:  FY05 options for 46 production engines, publication source data, training, spare parts, flight test engine refurbishment of four engines, and special tooling; FY07 options for 44 production engines and technical support; FY08 options for 44 production engines, flight test engine refurbishment of four engines, and technical support; and finally, an F Y09 option for 18 production engines.  Market research has indicated that two engine manufacturers can meet this requirement with an existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) engine with minor modifications.  The two manufacturers are General Electric Aircr aft Engines (GEAE), 1000 Western Ave., Lynn, MA 01910 and Rolls Royce Corporation (RRC), 2001 S. Tibbs Ave., Indianapolis,  IN 46241.  Therefore, this solicitation will be issued based on limited competition between these two sources.  A single firm fixed price (FFP) contract is anticipated with cost reimbursable line items for the services portions of the requirement.  This commercial item procurement will be solicited, evaluated, and awarded using FAR Part 15 procedures.  A pre-proposal conference will be  conducted at Ft. Eustis approximately two weeks after the RFP is issued.  The Government will make award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors spe cified elsewhere in the solicitation, considered.  This requirement is classified under NAICS code 336412.  Responsible sources may request a copy of the solicitation by contacting Ms. Valerie Arthur at varthur@aatd.eustis.army.mil or 757-878-3306.  Offero rs who have requested a copy of the RFP will be notified by email once it is released.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  Numbered notes 9 and 26 apply.

<DESC>Solicitation Number PR-NC-04-10220 is modified to correct the set-aside type from Partial Small Business Set-aside to Total Small Business Set-aside. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for support to operate, maintain, and enhance the AIRNow Data Management Center (DMC).  The AIRNow program has grown from its nascence in 1997 as an ozone mapping system encompassing the northeastern United States to a nation-wide air quality mapping and forecasting program.  AIRNow receives data from over 1,500 monitoring sites, generates hourly map animations, collects air quality forecasts from more than 300 cities, and disseminates information to major weather service providers, including media companies, USA Today, and The Weather Channel.  These air quality maps and forecasts enable State and local governments to inform the public of possible health impacts and voluntary participation in emission reduction programs (e.g., ozone action days).  This effort includes performing customer and technical support; conducting technical and data analyses, air quality forecasting support and training; and technical meeting support related to the AIRNow and Air Quality Index (AQI) programs which involve several Federal Agencies, numerous State and local air quality agencies and media partners.  Additional requirements include, but are not limited to, supporting the State Host Computer (SHC) network and related information transfer systems; obtaining, processing and storing air quality data delivered from the SHC network on scheduled basis; maintaining master air quality monitoring station location data table and other agency/system parameters; generation of contour map of ozone concentrations (static and animated) using existing EPA mapping tool or recommended and accepted software; providing support to and coordination of weather service providers and media partners; producing data products for the Weather Service Providers (WSPs) in GRIB format or customer specified format; recommending improvements to the overall AIRNow program, DMC, and products; updating the AIRNow Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to reflect new operations, and provide EPA with current documentation; setting up methods to automatically replicate the AIRNow system; monitoring AIRNNow DMC operations seven (7) days per week/365 days per ear; identifying problems or outages and notify appropriate agencies; processing and reviewing air quality forecasts issued by each agency; providing forecasting support for the 36 USA Today cities; providing telephone support and communication to USA Today and other media partners and customers, as needed; producing EPA and AIRNow customer AQI forecast products; providing AQI marketing support, product development and educational training to stakeholders; and, perform and provide studies and reports.  EPA anticipates award of a cost-plus-fixed-fee level of effort contract for a total of 92,500 labor hours consisting of a Base requirement of 13,500 hours, Option Period I - 16,000 hours, Option Period II - 18,500 hours, Option Period III - 21,000 hours, and Option Period IV - 23,500 hours. NAICS Code 541990 applies with a size standard of $6M in average annual receipts over the last three years.  This is a similar requirement to Contract GS-10F-0181K, Task Order #1306 with Sonoma Technology, Inc.  The solicitation is expected to be issued approximately April 30, 2004 as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.  Proposals will be due approximately 30 calendar days after issuance of the solicitation.   The solicitation and amendments will be available via the Internet World Wide Web at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are encouraged to access the solicitation and amendments via Internet.  If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via Internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  Hard copies or diskettes will not be available.  Telephone and fax requests will not be honored.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime Vendor (PV) to provide items under the general groupings of lumber and related products and woodworking machinery and tools for the Korea and Japan regions.  A PV, or integrated suppliers, can be defined as the designation of a single source of supply for a wide range of products.  The requirements covered under this solicitation include, but are not limited to, Federal Supply Class (FSC) 55: softwood lumber, hardwood lumber, plywood/veneer, poles, pilings, ties, crossarms, dowels, plugs, stakes, doors and moldings and FSC 32: sawmill and planing mill machinery, woodworking machines/tools and attachments for woodworking machinery.  This is a representative list and should not be considered exhaustive of all products that will be required of the acquisition.  The intended solicitation will cover military customers located in Korea and Japan (including Okinawa).  Prospective offerors should have the capability to deliver lumber and related products as well as woodworking machinery and tools within the region.  The intended solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant contract being an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for two (2) base years and three (3) one-year options.  Estimated value of this acquisition is $6,800,000 for the base period; $17,000,000 for total contract period.  This will be a best value/source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price.  Solicitation SP0560-04-R-0071 is anticipated to be issued on 12 April 2004 with an estimated closing date of 12 May 2004.

Destination delivery to a consolidated freight station designated by the offeror. The freight station must be located in or in close proximity to a major port located in the states of Washington, Oregon or California that has regular ocean freight service to Korea and Japan.  Shipping containers will be provided by the Government, however, loading of containers is the responsibility of the contractor; accordingly, pricing must include any costs associated with the labor, dunnage, etc. necessary to properly load the material into the shipping container.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: MMS Procurement Operations Branch, Attn: Ms. Jane Carlson, 381 Elden Street, MS. 2510 Herndon VA 20170 Description This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541710 "Oceanographic research and development laboratories or services" with a size standard of 500 employees.  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  PURPOSE OF PROPOSED STUDY: The use of specific habitat in the MMS Cook Inlet Multi-Sale Area by the ESA candidate beluga whale, and 5 baleen whale species including the threatened or endangered humpbacked, fin, sei, and right whales, and gray whales shall be studied using passive acoustic monitoring techniques.  Specific objectives of this study are: 1) to estimate the temporal and spatial patterns of variation in the vocalizations of beluga whales in key areas of Lower Cook Inlet in order to estimate the a) frequency and direction of passage of belugas past the eastern and western forelands, b) frequency and direction of passage of beluga whales between Cook Inlet and the Gulf of Alaska through Kennedy Entrance, Stevenson Entrance, and Shelikof Strait, and c) temporal patterns of use of Kamishak Bay by beluga whales; 2)  to estimate species specific, temporal and spatial patterns of variation in the vocalizations of baleen whales in the Barren Islands Deferral Area of the MMS Cook Inlet Multi-Sale Area, and to the extent possible, estimate temporal changes in the relative abundance of each species.  This study is envisioned to be a 3-year effort, including 2 years of field monitoring.  It will require the use of passive acoustic methods.  Such methods could include, but not necessarily be limited to, any combination of the following: ARPs (Autonomous Recording Packages), DIFAR (Directional Frequency Analysis and Recording) sonobuoys, continuous seafloor acoustic recorders, and hydrophone arrays with shore-based continuous recorders. A proven data management plan will be needed to ensure high quality data, lines of custody, archival, distribution and submittal to accepted data repositories. Collected data shall be interpreted and synthesized with other existing data and knowledge of whale use of Lower Cook Inlet to develop a final synthesis report addressing the objectives.  Publication of findings in peer reviewed scientific literature is essential.  SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  In order to compete for these requirements, interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by detailing: (1) your key personnel (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the tasks with their qualifications, their specific experience, and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals; (2) your access to equipment and facilities (marine boats or other water craft, laboratory, and other facilities, equipment, and instruments necessary to accomplish the tasks); (3) your organizational experience; and (4) specific references (including contract number & project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with the point of contact & telephone number & E-mail address) for previous work of this nature that your key personnel or organization has performed within the last four years (references will be checked).  If you believe the Government will find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your company to address the problem.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner. RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 4:00 pm Eastern Time on April 29, 2004.  Interested parties shall submit their Capabilities Statements in original and one (1) copy to Jane Carlson, Contracting Officer, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, MS-2500, Herndon, VA 20170-4817. Two (2) additional copies shall be sent to Charles Monnett, Ph.D., Minerals Management Service, Alaska OCS Region, 949 E. 36th Avenue, Anchorage, AK 99508. Timeliness of receipt of submissions will be determined by the time received in the Procurement Operations Branch, Herndon VA. Questions should be sent as soon as possible to Jane M. Carlson at Jane.Carlson@mms.gov or Fax (703) 787-1041. Phone calls are strongly encouraged.

<DESC>The U.S. Army ARDEC, Business Interface Office is seeking sources to provide a 105mm tube and breech, commonly referred to as cannon, for Foreign Comparative  Testing (FCT) in support of the Enhanced Forcible Entry Cannon (EFEC).  Cannon  to be supplied with a recoil mitigation and stand-alone platform suitable for  ballistic firing of the cannon at elevation angles from –5 degrees to +70  degrees.  The U.S. Army intends to acquire two complete cannon platforms to  support extensive testing of the item for potential application to the EFEC and  Non-line of Sight Cannon (NLOS-C) Systems.  The cannon should have the  capability when combined with an existing propellant charge and pre-formed  fragmenting projectile to demonstrate commensurate range and lethality as the  current U.S. 155mm weapon systems.  The cannon must require minimal  technological development and demonstrate the capability of being downsized to  a weight and range to meet or exceed the emerging requirement of the EFEC.  The  cannon will potentially be the central component for multiple indirect fire  support systems on towed and self-propelled platforms. Delivery of items for  assessment is scheduled for the first quarter in Government Fiscal Year (GFY)  05 with conclusion of the test effort in the first quarter of GFY 07. Key performance parameters include an unassisted indirect fire maximum range of  a pre-formed fragmenting (PFF) projectile shall be no less than 20 kilometers  (threshold); 24 kilometers (objective); shall be capable of achieving a  Circular Error Probable (CEP) of less than 0.3 percent and a rate of fire of 8  rounds/minute (threshold); 10 rounds/minute (objective). Please advise if your product is a commercially available item.   Proprietary  and/or classified information will be protected as denoted with submission.  Interested firms should submit literature/brochures not exceeding twenty (20)  pages describing their technical capabilities, item design details and  operational characteristics, production capacity (monthly sustainable  production rate, maximum production rate, timeframe for first and subsequent  deliveries), location of manufacturing facilities and unit production costs.

<SUBJECT>--Modular Boot System
<DESC>The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, in support of Program Manager - Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation to identify potential technologies and end item concepts that may be used to m eet the needs for a future multi-theater, multi-functional footwear system that will be known as the Modular Boot System (MBS).  MBS will take advantage of advances in technology and materials resulting in an improved, lightweight combat footwear system de signed to incorporate enhanced biomechanical properties, increase comfort and enhance performance in multiple operational environments.  MBS will be compatible with legacy and developmental individual uniforms.  MBS will provide warmth and protection subst antial enough for the Soldier to perform assigned mission essential duties and individual movement techniques in operational environments ranging from Basic Cold (-5 to -25 degrees F) to Hot (90 to 120 degrees F).  MBS will meet or exceed the operational c apabilities of the following OCIE footwear items: Boot, Hot Weather Type I (Jungle) and II (Desert); Boot, Combat Temperate Weather, Type II, Tan; Boot, Cold Weather; and Boot, Intermediate Cold Wet; as well as potentially eliminate the need for additional  specialty and environmental boots.  Interest is in a readily available product/technology that could be used in developmental production within the next six to twelve months.  MBS must be capable of meeting critical technical requirements as follows [requ irements are listed as Threshold (T) or Objective (O)]: 1) Provide protection -20 (ambient) to 110 degrees F surface temperature (T).   2) Achieve reductions in weight and a weight reduction of 5% (T), 10% (O) over current boots and components.  3) Enhance  Soldier's comfort, mobility, and traction.  Increase traction over current leather boot (T); increase over current boots and components (O).  4) Be lightweight (rugged), comfortable and supportive boot designed for prolonged foot movement (road marches) w hile the Soldier carries heavy loads.  5) Be compatible with standard (T) clothing and individual equipment and existing and developmental (O) OCIE equipment normally worn, carried, or used by the Soldier.  6) Outer layer elements of the MBS must be subdue d in color (T).  All layers must reduce the operator's signature in temperate, desert, urban, mountain and/or arctic environments (O) while not increasing the multi-spectrum signature.  7) Have flame resistance equal (T) to or better than (O) current OCIE boots.  8) Be easy to don and doff.  9) Have a service life of 120 days, and a shelf life of 5 years.  10) Be able to withstand wiping and/or brushing (T).  Be resistant to deterioration from contact with petroleum-based products and similar type materials  (O).  11) Resist mold and fungus growth.  12) Be able to be worn and operated by a warfighter in any terrain type and climatic condition (Basic Cold and Hot).  13) Have a moisture wicking capability equal to or better than the aforementioned OCIE boots. 14) Have a replaceable (i.e., resolable) sole that incorporates compounds and design techniques to provide enhanced cushioning and sole flexibility during prolonged foot movement and individual movement techniques while minimizes the clinging and build up of mud and foreign materiel.  Interested sources must, within thirty (30) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their proposed solution(s) as well as how they are made or could be modified to address the military requ irement for a MBS.  Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, and facilities. Product information should include estimated product cost, technical information (e.g. technical literature, data and il lustrations, independent laboratory test results), performance capabilities, relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the Government for such sample.  Firms should provide estimated pricing for proposed footwear system including estimated pricing to purchase samples for possible evaluation.  Firms responding shall ind icate whether or not they are a small business.  This notice is for market research only.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Michael Holthe, US Army Soldier Systems Center, AMSRD-NSC-IP-A Bldg 4 Room D323, 15 Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-50 19.

<SUBJECT>--JTRS JPO Request for Information Request for participation in Government/Industry consortium to develop specifications and standard design guidance enabling portable code in the Signal Processing Subsystem
<DESC>The Government is soliciting input and participation from industry in an effort to develop specifications and standardized design guidance to enable portable code in the Signal Processing Subsystem (SPS).  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent that this  specification and design guidance be required on all upcoming JTRS development efforts.   The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Joint Program Office (JPO) will be conducting an accelerated effort to develop specifications and/or associated design guidance enabling portable code in the Signal Processing Subsystem (i.e., Digital Signal Processor s (DSPs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)) associated with the JTRS.  It is necessary to extend the JTRS waveform portability concept (e.g., the Software Communications Architecture (SCA) and associated design guidance) to address portability in the SPS environment.  It is anticipated that this additional specification and standardized design guidance will be included as part of future versions of the SCA.  Development of any specifications and standardized design guidance will be done with Indust ry participation.   The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s near term plan includes a Government/Industry Workshop (29-30 April in Arlington, VA), formation of a dedicated Government/Industry Ã¢Â€Âœtiger teamÃ¢Â€Â to develop a formal specification by late May, a comment resolution phase, and submittal to the SCA change control process in June.  Additional areas of concern include standardized interfaces, validation activities and initial implementations, configuration control, and long term testing implications.   The Government is requesting industry response of intent to participate in this Government/Industry accelerated effort to develop specifications and standardized design guidance enabling portable code in the SPS, level of commitment/resources, and willingn ess/commitment to propose existing approaches in open forum for consideration as basis for draft specification.  The Government also requests draft material on industry proposed approaches to be briefed as a basis at the upcoming Industry/Government Worksh op The Government does not intend to provide any funding for participation in this effort.  All data and information used in this forum is required to be non-proprietary with unlimited rights. Responses are due by COB 16 April 2004. The JTRS JPO point of contact is Ms. Jeannie Walker-Bridges, jeannie.walker-bridges@hqda.army.mil, 703-588-0520.

Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror in his proposal and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past and present performance.     Under the past performance evaluation criteria, the evaluation of an offeror's present and past work record will be performed to assess the Government's confidence in the offeror's probability of successfully performing as proposed.     The Government will evaluate the offeror's demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet user's needs, including cost and schedule.     Evaluation of the offerors past performance will be accomplished by reviewing aspects of an Offeror's relevant present and recent past performance, focusing on and targeting performance which is relevant to this effort.

In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror.

Offerors are hereby advised that only those proposals determined to have a reasonable chance for award of a contract will be included in the competitive range.     While every effort will be made to maintain strong competition, the Contracting Officer will also look to eliminate time consuming and unnecessary discussions with those offerors whose proposals have no reasonable chance for award.     This procedure is considered beneficial to both the Air Force and the offerors involved since, in addition to saving further expenditure of resources, acquisition lead time should be reduced.     The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions.     The contractor shall provide at a minimum a spreadsheet listing all labor categories, hourly rates and extended labor costs.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001:  QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ~ SOF LANGUAGE TRAINING & SURVEY ANALYSIS
(Questions answered as of 7 April 2004)



1.  QUESTION:  Is lack of prior contractual training experience with SOCOM a disqualifying factor?

ANSWER:  The answer is "Yes". The requirement was included because of the unique quality and methodology of most SOF training. Anyone not experienced in SOF training methods would require a significant train up period in order to be able to start the work required in the contract. This additional work would increase the cost of the contract as well as extending the time to accomplish contract objectives.

2. QUESTION: Please clarify the nature of the solicitation. Most statements suggest that the solicitation is for a comprehensive, empirical SOF language training needs assessment, training evaluation, training effectiveness, and utility study to provide SOF leaders with data and recommendations with which they can make effective decisions about language proficiency and training issues and resources allocation for SOF language.  However, some statements suggest a greater scope to include other responsibilities like oversight (e.g., “ensure that SOF personnel receive effective language training…”) or instructional design (e.g., “Design an integrated…”).  


ANSWER:  In general, is it the case that this solicitation is solely for a comprehensive, empirical training needs assessment, training evaluation, training effectiveness, and utility applied research program related to SOF language?  If there are other responsibilities, please clarify?  This is generally the case with the exception being that we want recommendations on how, what, when, where to change current programs to attain optimum results.  The recommended courses of action or solution sets should account for other factors such as training time available and should identify major limitations to implementation.  For example, “add 6- to 14-months training time at DLI for all SEALS” would not be an acceptable COA.  Whereas a COA such as the WARCOM indicates that without substantial growth in force structure, directives from SOCOM, and coordination with supported war fighters they cannot add the training time required to train their initial entry SEALS to ILR 2.  

3. Clarification of terms:  

3a. QUESTION:  By “effectiveness” of training, do you mean a model tha… ANSWER:. This is a model that produces the most proficient operator over time without regard to cost
3b. QUESTION:.  By “analyze the total cost” of training, do you mean calculate the cost per unit effectiveness (i.e., utility analysis) for each training program (i.e., for each different POI)?  If you are referring to utility analysis, do you have a specific utility model in mind or just one that considers both direct and indirect cost?   ANSWER:  This part of the project takes the effectiveness results and then ranks in order the cheapest to the most expensive all models, in use and proposed, that actually accomplish the requirements.  It should also order the models in use and COAs that are put forward even if they do not achieve the requirements (there may be some cases where there is no solution, only a “best” COA.

4. QUESTION:   By “metrics,” do you mean any valid and reliable measures necessary to evaluate the impact of training, the instructor, the organizational climate, and individual differences on training outcomes and performance from the training evaluation (e.g, Kirkpatrick) and training effectiveness (e.g., Noe & Colquitt) standpoints? Also, when you refer to metrics, do you want some metrics that are standard across all training (e.g., pre-training questionnaire) and others that are customized for the specific program’s POI?
ANSWER:   Metrics of primary interest: “valid and reliable measures necessary to evaluate the impact of training and individual differences on training outcomes and performance.  It is preferable to use existing, standard DOD metrics such as the OPI, DLPT DLAB, etc BUT if these are insufficient, their deficiencies should be noted and alternatives recommended with justification.  Additional metrics might include “number hours trained”, “type of training (classroom, structured immersion, tutorial, etc), etc.  I include student:teacher ratios, contact hours/day,week, month in this category and other “parts” of the training that can be measured and that may have a significant impact on training 
Metrics of secondary interest: organizational climate and instructors

5.  QUESTION:   The solicitation suggestions that some training programs to be studied are large in scope and institutionalized (e.g., SF language training at SWCS) and others are small in scope and a highly variable (e.g., pre-deployment training at a small unit or a special training program like BITS).  Is this correct?  ANSWER:  Correct.

6.  QUESTION:  Given the highly variable nature of some training, it makes a finite research proposal and estimates (e.g., travel) impossible for some studies. Given the variable nature and scope of some studies, would you consider and look favorably on a proposal that proposed specific institutional and standardized studies as appropriate and a flexible payment system for variable, special or unforeseen studies?  ANSWER:   Correct, so this approach is necessary.

7. QUESTION:   Do the desired deliverables for this project include the companion surveys to the focus group study conducted as part of the SOF Language Transformation Strategy Development Project?  Are there any other special studies that should be considered?
ANSWER:   -the first deliverable will be an online survey the results of which will be used in addition to the focus group study results to provide a single, integrated analysis.

8.  QUESTION:    To conduct many of these studies, the cooperation of the units, commands, PERSCOM, DLI, and other entities (e.g., DMDC) not directly under the control of SOFLO will be required.  Can SOFLO ensure this cooperation?   ANSWER:   No, the SOFLO is not imbued with such God-like powers. 

9.  QUESTION:  If a proposed study does not take place or is cancelled due to factors outside the control of the contractor or SOFLO or USASOC, will there be a mechanism or study “kill fee” to reimburse the successful contractor for any loss or expenditures?  ANSWER:   The government, in conjunction with the vendor, will determine when a part of the study is too hard or impossible to complete.  At that point the vendor would be reimbursed for actual, reasonable costs incurred.

10. QUESTION:   Having worked with research projects in the SOF community, it usually requires a lot of time (and travel) to gain acceptance and support for, to plan, and to execute these projects.  The solicitation suggests many of these projects require time to set up, especially ones that require original data collection.  Is there flexibility on the timetable for the projects to accommodate the involvement other entities?  

 ANSWER:  Ideally the vendors’ proposals should include an initial, broad brush look at the programs to be researched and layout a methodology for accomplishing all of the major tasks.  For example: First we will study and report on training at SWCS (year 1), then at AFSOC(year 1.5) and then at …..   OR we will initiate studies simultaneously at SWCS, AFSOC, WARCOM etc and provide reports at the end of Year 2 whereupon we will begin work on SF NG, SF AC, and PSYOP RC and report in year 3.5.  The vendor can plan it out in any effective manner—the vendors’ proposed methodology if any will be used as a component of evaluating the vendors’ actual understanding of SOF and language training (technical).

11. QUESTION:  As a part of the project, are you looking for the successful firm or investigators to publish research findings in peer-reviewed scientific/academic and present findings at scientific/academic conferences to disseminate the research into the public domain? If so, is past performance in this area one of the decision criteria?

ANSWER:  The quality of the research and findings should be sufficiently solid, scientific, and valid to be defensible within academia AND science.  Previous success of this nature is part of the “Past Performance” eval criterion.

 


12.  QUESTION:   In a previous SOF language solicitation, the project lead or principal investigator/analyst was required to have an earned Ph.D. in industrial/organizational psychology because of the discipline’s focus on training and performance and its high standards of data analysis and applied research methodology, does this solicitation have the same requirement?   ANSWER:  Yes

12.  QUESTION:   In a previous SOF language solicitation, the project lead or principal investigator/analyst was required to be a member of the American Psychological Association in good standing, is this a requirement for this solicitation? 
 ANSWER:   No, but it is a discriminator.

13.  QUESTION:   In a previous SOF language solicitation, the project lead or principal investigator/analyst was required to be “an expert in their field as evidenced by an academic appointment and/or peer-reviewed publications in addition to the PhD,” does this solicitation require investigators with the same expert status related to training evaluation/effectiveness, relevant data analysis techniques, language proficiency measurement, longitudinal data analysis, and surveying?  If so, do you want copies of the peer-reviewed conference papers and journal articles?  ANSWER:   Yes and yes.

14.  QUESTION:   Should the successful firm or investigators have existing research relationships and credibility within the SOF community, the military research/language communities (e.g., Army Research Institute, Defense Language Institute, etc.), and the academic research community (e.g., ACTFL, etc.) to facilitate the project and acceptance of its findings?   ANSWER:   The government will not pay the vendor to cultivate such contacts—the vendor must be ready to begin work upon award. 

15.  QUESTION:   The solicitation mentions providing past performance for at least two SOF training projects.  Would you prefer projects related specifically to training needs assessment, training evaluation, training effectiveness, or proficiency measurement?  Because the project seems to involve a lot of surveying and data analysis, does the successful firm need to provide past performance for these types of projects in the SOF community as well?  ANSWER:   We will accept no more than five such examples per vendor.  Examples featuring SOF and training evaluation/effectiveness are most desireable

16.  QUESTION:   Are firms that provide language training/instruction, language learning tools, and other related products/programs that are to be evaluated eligible to bid on this project? 
ANSWER:   Yes

17.  QUESTION:   Are there any “other” special knowledge, skills and other attributes that the project requires of the successful investigators or firm?
ANSWER:  -knowledge of current, best means of teaching/learning languages
-expertise in statistical analysis

18.	 QUESTION:   Is this only a research and analysis of SOF language training programs?  ANSWER:  Correct

19.  QUESTION:  Is this a phased approach for a comprehensive SOF language program?   ANSWER:  It is up to the vendor to decide how best to execute the research and develop and recommend solution sets or courses of action

20.   QUESTION:  Is the research and analysis portion to be accomplished during the first or base year?  ANSWER:   It is up to the vendor to decide how best to execute the research and develop and recommend solution sets or courses of action

21.	QUESTION:  Will the design, integration and solution implementation be accomplished during the option years?  ANSWER:  The solicitation in the GSA site may be misleading.  Implementation is not part of the contract.  The solution set(s) is (are) to be designed in an integrated fashion.  The solutions must fit in with other training/operational requirements and/or identify shortcomings/recommendations for changes to entire programs as needed.
22.	QUESTION:  Should the RFP response include the design, integration, and solution implementation activities?  ANSWER:  The vendor will design/develop/recommend training programs to optimize language proficiency for SOF.  The programs must be feasible, effective, and cost efficient.  The vendor will not design or implement language training nor will the vendor implement recommended solutions set(s).
23.	 QUESTION:  What is the government’s preferred approach?   ANSWER:  none
24.	QUESTION:  When was the last research and analysis conducted?  ANSWER:   A SOCOM wide focus group research  project was conducted in FY04 and the report was completed Apr04 
25.	QUESTION:  Will the last research and analysis conducted be provided as GFI? ANSWER:  Pending DCSAC approval, the SOFLO will provide copies to qualified vendors
26.	QUESTION:  Why is the government conducting this project (s)?    ANSWER:  To improve both the effectiveness and the efficiency of languge training for SOF
27.	QUESTION:  Do you have examples of the standard 2-page resume required? ANSWER:  SOFLO does not
SOLICITATION:
The US Army Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg North Carolina has a requirement to provide a Language Training Program Analysis and Long-Range Surveying Device for the Special Operations Forces Language Office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials and transportation unless stated in the specifications.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. All quotes shall reference the Request for Quotation number H92239-04-R-0002. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2001-20. It is the Contractor's responsibility to be familiar with all applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541990. The size standard is $6,000,000. This requirement is a total 100% set-aside for small business.  A firm fixed price contract will be issued with a base period and four option periods. A Pre-proposal Conference is scheduled for Thursday, 8 April 2004, 1:00 p.m., HQ USASOC, Bldg E-2929, DCSRM Conference Room 252, Fort Bragg, NC. The contractor shall provide the following:  All personnel and services necessary to conduct the survey program of research analysis of the current Special Operations Forces (SOF) language training programs.  Ensure that SOF personnel receive effective language training to achieve the language skill levels necessary to effectively meet the requirements of their missions.  Design an integrated program which means a program that addresses all needs start to finish to provide SOF personnel effective language training.  This would integrate initial, sustainment, and enhancement training for all flavors of SOF (Army/Navy/AF) and all components (AC/RC).  Currently some SOF receive institutional training in their qualification courses and then sustainment and enhancement training at the unit.  Most SOF get 100% of their training at the unit.  So, the integrated program would take into account all other (non-language) SOF training requirements and propose a solution that is integrated both in terms of initial, sustainment and enhancement language training and in terms of the qualification and at unit training that SOF go through. The contractor shall provide a survey process that will utilize commonly accepted industry methodologies and practices to conduct the survey, which will analyze, but not be limited to, such factors as initial acquisition, sustainment and enhancement language training programs throughout the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  As a minimum, the process will assess available historical data; the relationship between service member Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) and their subsequent language proficiency; instructor qualifications and training materials; instructional methodologies; a longitudinal study of factors effecting skills retention; utility of computer-based and Distributive Learning in language training; and initial acquisition training at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (JFKSWCS).  Results:  This work will create a systemic approach and data to aid in military decision making on the following:  a) best methodology for efficient and cost effective conduct of SOF Foreign Language acquisition and sustainment training, b) best way to select individuals for specific language to be taught, c) metrics required to effectively monitor and adjust training programs.  Note: all assertions/conclusions must be supported.

Projects:  (there may be separate projects, a single project or several-the vendor may determine that certain SOF can be "lumped" together:  Provide empirically based research that documents the effectiveness of existing and new techniques for providing initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training.  The research will analyze the total cost (instructors, materials, overhead, travel, training time, training development, etc.) of initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training used by USSOCOM.   This training is done through military institutions, unit language labs, academic institutions, distributed learning, one-on-one tutoring, and a host of other methods.   This information will then be used to compare results in terms of Defense Language Proficiency Tests (DLPT) scores, training time, DLAB scores and target scores.  All training methods and types considered must be feasible (e.g. very few SOF personnel can or will attend 4 hours of class after their normal duty day to acquire a new language).  We also need recommendations on what metrics are needed and when/where they should be measured.  Specifically, the final product should address the following:  1.What is (are) the most cost effective initial acquisition, sustainment, and enhancement language training method(s) or type(s) for RC Army SF?  AC Army SF? AC Navy SOF?  AC Air Force SOF?  RC Army CA?  AC Army CA?  RC Army PSYOP?  AC Army PSYOP?  The contractor shall provide a Statement of Work and a DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List with their proposal.  The contractor shall include their management and technical approach in achieving the objectives; an explanation of the labor mix proposed, as well explain their material and travel line.

Does the Loaner Unit have to have the 4 TAXI interfaces, 1 RS-422 interface & 2 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces? Can the Loaner Unit have 2 TAXI interfaces, 1 RS-422, and 2 GigE interfaces? ANSWER: 1) The loaner unit does not have to be an exact unit.  2 TAXI interfaces is sufficient.  The primary purpose of the loaner unit is for MSOC to being their development with the interfaces for command, control, and status of the ITC. QUESTION 2) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:  Please concur that the maximum aggregate rate is 135 Mbps across all interfaces (input aggregate total is 135 Mbps with simultaneous output aggregate total of 135 Mbps) ANSWER: 2) The aggregate input rate is 135 Mbps, with a corresponding aggregate output rate of 135 Mbps.  The assumption in the question is correct. QUESTION 3) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:  Section 3.71.12 states that 95 Mbps is required on any one interface. Previous sections show that the requirement for RS-422 (sections 3.2.4.3 & 3.2.6.4) is 20 kbps to 10 Mbps. Is 95 Mbps not required for the RS-422 I/F ?  ANSWER: 3) 95 Mbps is not required for the RS-422 interface.  95 Mbps is required only on the TAXI interface.  The specification of 20 kbps to 10 Mbps for the RS-422 interface is correct. QUESTION 4) SOW: Table 1 System Supplies and Services Qty & Unit column does not correlate with text (6-8 yrs, 24-32 years, etc). We take the Unit column to mean [unit*year] quantities.   Is this correct?  ANSWER: 4) The services quantities in the "Qty" column are the total years of service being purchased (number of items times years).  The expression in the "Unit" column (e.g., "yrs") is the unit basis upon which pricing is to be stated. For maintenance, pricing is per item, per year as indicated in the Table Notes. QUESTION 5) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:  Section 3.2.4 & Section 3.2.6 requires a Gated Clock for the RS-422 interface.  Avtec provides two types of gated clock interfaces: a) RS-422 with Data, Clock, and Gate Signals,     or b) RS-422 with Data and Clock signals, gating based on a gapped clock. Is a Gate signal for the clock provided by the external interfaces, or is the gate derived from the gapped clock? ANSWER: 5) The gated clock specification refers to gaps in the clock signal rather than to a separate gate signal.  In the absence of output data, the clock output signal is to be halted such that equipment downstream does not receive a clock signal.  In the input mode, the clock signal is halted when data is absent QUESTION 6) SOW:  Section 3.2.2 states that Limited Interface ITCs are described in the Technical Specification. We can find no reference to the Limited Interface ITC in the Technical Specification. ANSWER: 6) The limited interface ITC has not TAXI interfaces, but only the Gig-E and the RS-422 interfaces.  This ITC is for situations where only the network and RS-422 interfaces are used.  A prime example is the ITC for use in the station simulator facility.  It will receive bitstream input data on the RS-422 interface and CCSDS packets via the Ethernet interface, and will output VCDUs to the Ethernet interface.  The additional cost of TAXI interfaces is not required for this type of functionality. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to COB, April 12, 2004. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 10, 2004.

<DESC>1.  Must bidders provide the names and qualifications of proposed economists at this stage?  Will substitution be permitted?

  Yes.  According to section C.3.8 of the solicitation's Statement of Objective (SOO), a bidder "... must provide, in its proposal, the name, address, resume, and verifiable proof of the level of education (copies of educational degree/certificates) and experience of each proposed applicant for the economist positions pursuant to this contract."  The quality and backgrounds of the proposed economists will help us judge the responsiveness and technical merits of the bid.  

	While we understand that some substitutions might become necessary if candidates are no longer available at the time of award of the contract, we would like to keep this to a minimum.  If substitutions must be made, the contractor should consult with the CPA project coordinator prior to selection of a new economist.  In addition, an economist with equivalent or better skills must be provided.  It is our aim to ensure that the overall quality of the contractor's team not be diminished by substitutions. 

2.  Must economists work full time?

Yes.  Project economists are required to reside in the location to which they are assigned, will conduct on-going surveys in seventeen sectors throughout the year and be asked to submit weekly reports on the information, quantitative and qualitative, collected during the week.  In order to properly complete their assigned work, they must be engaged in this research full-time.

3.  What level of English proficiency is needed?  Is the same level required for all hired economists?

Economists will be required to be fluent in written and spoken English.  All project work will be conducted in English.  Each will be required to provide a weekly written report to the CPA project coordinator and experts containing the information collected in response to the week's work assignment.  CPA experts will provide the economists comment, advice and professional training via email and in-person.   Finally, those economists working for the CPA and those with specialties in the fields listed in section 3.9 of the SOO will be required to contribute portions of the monthly, quarterly and final reports to be published and provided to the public.

4.  Is there a need for international input and capacity building?

As stated in section C.1.2 of the SOO, the creation of a "trained cadre of Iraqi economists" is a key objective of this project.  Training will be provided to project economists by CPA experts in several ways.  First, there will be a pre-survey training session which all economists will attend.  Then CPA experts will provide on-the-job training via provision of sector outlines expressed as research templates and weekly feedback reports in response to the economists own weekly reports.  

5.  Is subcontracting permissible?

Yes.  

6.  Can potential bidders meet with CPA contracting officers to discuss these matters?

Questions can be submitted to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at fortenberryj@orha.centcom.mil.  Responses will be posted for the benefit of all potential offerors.
