<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 500 to 2,500 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located in the Continental United States. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility:
Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.  
The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain one or more facilities located in the continental United States, each to pasture 500 to 2,500 wild horses. The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.  During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract.
On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions.
This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment. 
Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 500 to 2,500 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized.
Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor.
The objectives of this contract are:
To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals; To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants.
The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks: Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 500 to 2,500 (Based on the offeror's proposal) wild horses grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations; Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis; Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment; Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.  Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations; Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and/or description of the animal, date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI; Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain, as an act of mercy.
Handling and Gathering: In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups; All horses shall be handled, treated and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling; Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices; Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather.  The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment.  Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facilities to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment; The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped. 
Corral/holding Facility -Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels). It is anticipated that the corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather, ship and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72 inches high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  No barbed wire will be allowed in the construction of corrals and any corral constructed of mesh wire (openings no larger than 2 by 4 inches) must be equipped with at least 3 wood sight boards (2 by 8 inches) located on the upper portion of the fence.  The three sight boards shall be spaced no more than 12 inches apart.  Corrals constructed of pipe or wood must have openings of not more than 12 inches between horizontal members.  Corrals and holding areas need to be free of protrusions, and hazards.  Corral gates shall be constructed of wood or pipe the same height as the fences.  Gates shall be visible to the horses either from the materials used in construction or by using materials such as plywood or plastic mesh placed on the gates.  The contractor will furnish a stable area (concrete or gravel) to place a hydraulic squeeze chute provided by the Bureau.  If electricity is unavailable the Bureau will provide a generator to run the hydraulic chute; Two sorting corrals, each with a minimum of 2,500 square feet, which would be used for holding horses for short term (up to five days prior to shipment); Soil types in corrals/pens must be well drained and non-alkaline in nature.  Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage; At least two or more small pastures to maintain approximately 150 wild horses prior to shipment (30 days or more) will be necessary.  These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process.  Fencing must be constructed of small wire mesh, low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing; The small pastures, described under (5) above, must have sufficient water for 150 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day; Adequate chutes and crowding alleys to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals; The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36feet in length, 28-32 inches wide, and at least 72 inches tall.
Unloading and Working Facility - The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animal's vision and will minimize the risk that animals may attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches.    Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel.
Fences - Perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 48 inches in height and completely enclose the facility.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48 inches in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures. 
Pastures - The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain 500 to 2,500 (depending on the offeror's proposal) wild horses year round. The land must be privately owned by the offeror or the offeror must have long term control of the offered lands.  Offered lands cannot include public lands, BLM wild horse and burro herd areas, herd management areas or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  If any public lands, are within the privately owned or controlled land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to verify that offered lands meet this requirement. Information on the location of BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Areas, Herd Areas and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory can be obtained by the Forest Service office or, for BLM land, by the BLM local office or the Wild Horse and Burro web site (www.wildhorseandburro.blm.gov.)  Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.  Pastures shall be free of hazards such as unfenced paved public highways.  If pastures are noncontiguous, they shall be managed as separate units, (no more than four units) each with a corral facility.  Horses shall not be moved from one unit to another except under extraordinary conditions and with the permission of the COR and/or PI.  The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles; Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable; The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described in paragraph f, below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body; The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above; Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures; Vegetation monitoring will be done by qualified personnel.  If vegetation utilization exceeds the moderate level, changes may need to be made so land health standards are maintained.
Supplemental Feed - Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12 percent, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low.  Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.   Hay used shall have a protein content of 12 percent, be leafy, green, well cured, and free of dust, mold and weeds or grasses deemed unhealthy forage for wild horses. 
Feed Requirements - A good quality grass, grass/legume mix or legume hay shall be fed to and made available in sufficient quantity for each animal, with a crude protein not less than 12 percent.  While the animals are in the corral areas, they shall be fed at least 2.5 percent of body weight per day.  The COR may test supplement or hay to verify its quality; Inclement weather will stress animals, requiring that the volume of feed be increased to maintain their body flesh.
Water, Minerals, and Salt - Each pasture shall have reliable water sources capable of supplying 16 gallons of clean water per horse, per day.  The maximum distance to water in any pasture shall be 4 miles; Granulated, rock, or block salt shall be accessible to all horses in each pasture; Minerals necessary to maintain the horses in good condition and that are deficient in the available forage in the care unit shall be provided to all horses in each pasture, either as a supplement or added to the salt.
Deaths and Disposal of Remains - Dead horses shall be identified by freeze number and physical description to the extent possible, and disposed of in accordance with State and/or local sanitation laws.  Rendering plants may be used for carcass disposal provided no compensation is received by any agency or individual disposing of the remains.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI, or designated representative immediately if the death of a horse is suspicious and it appears that a postmortem examination should be performed by a veterinarian.  The COR and/or PI shall hire a veterinarian and make the arrangements for this procedure.
Observation of Horses - The wild horses shall be observed by the contractor at a minimum of one (1) time per week, to determine the overall condition of the animals, and any deaths.  Observation will be conducted  more frequently when conditions warrant, i.e., during flooding, tornados, and the fire seasons, to ascertain their safety and well being and assure that fences are properly maintained.  Except in emergency situations, observations shall be carried out on foot, from a vehicle, or horseback.  In unusual situations, such as deep snow, etc., which make ground transportation impractical, aircraft may be used, with the prior approval of the COR and/or PI.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  Records that document, as a minimum, the date of the observation, number and condition of the horses, problems and concerns of the observer, and the name(s) of individual(s) making the observation shall be maintained.  Any problems or concerns shall be reported to the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of discovery.
Access to the Facility - Access to the unloading and loading chute shall accommodate both sedans with trailers and semi-trucks.  Access shall be available during inclement weather.
Observation for the Public - The site is not intended to be a public viewing area.  Therefore, the contractor will restrict or prohibit access onto the site by the general public; The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours of any request from humane organizations, general public, media or wild horse interest groups, to observe the horses.  All such organizations and groups may be allowed to tour the site only under the approval and guidance of the COR and/or PI; All requests to view the animals shall be directed to the COR and/or PI.
Records - An inventory that identifies all horses delivered to the site shall be kept at the facility.  A record shall be kept on the location (pasture) each horse occupies.  Each horse may be identified with a 4 digit freeze number on the hip, along with an angle freeze mark on the left side of the neck.  Horses that die shall be identified as soon as possible and noted on the monthly inventory.  Probable cause of death shall also be noted. Upon request by the COR and/or PI, the record shall be made available within 5 days for duplicating.
Veterinary Care - The BLM will provide and pay for a veterinarian to treat sick or injured horses, as deemed necessary by the COR and/or PI.  The veterinarian may be used to perform euthanasia on horses and conduct postmortem examinations as requested by the COR and/or PI.  The contractor shall gather and hold such animals and assist the veterinarian if necessary; All vaccinations and preparation for shipment of horses will be conducted by the BLM with assistance from the contractor.
Farrier Services - The COR and/or PI will determine if horses should have their feet trimmed.  BLM will make the arrangements and hire a farrier if trimming is needed.  The contractor shall gather the horses needing trimming and assist the farrier.
Working of Horses - The BLM will provide the hydraulic squeeze chute, generator if needed and any necessary panels to work horses to be shipped from the facility.  This may also be used to work horses in case of an outbreak of disease.  The panels and chute will be in the working corral area of the facility, and be able to tie into the loading chute area.   This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR080108, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about June 16, 2008. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is seeking a single Provider contractor with the ability to provide reporting capabilities under a single management infrastructure. The BLM desires a best value solution widely accepted by the helium production industry. The solution is for the purpose of providing plant production data monitoring and reporting by the BLM Helium Operations in Amarillo, Texas. The product will be deployed in June or July 2008. The products and services are separated into three components:1. Reporting software product and labor necessary for installation, configuration, and training2. Annual maintenance for the reporting software3. Optional integration with the appropriate database and Autopolling software (AutoSol)PROJECT BACKGROUND: The BLM Amarillo Field Office manages the United States strategic helium reserve. As part of this system, the BLM manages a high-pressure helium pipeline from which a number of storage contract holders and private plants can "take delivery of" or "make delivery to" the BLM helium pipeline system. There are approximately 10 measurement facilities. One is operated and owned by BLM, and the others are private companies with storage contracts. The BLM is in the process of installing a state-of-the-art metering facility at the BLM's Satanta, Kansas measuring station with satellite communications. The plant production and withdrawal data are collected and analyzed at the Amarillo Field Office (AMFO). Analysis includes data verification and the generation of billing reports. The second phase enhances functionality at the Amarillo office.

<DESC>The principal components of the work involves horizontal directional drilling of a borehole from an area near the left abutment of Hungry Horse Dam (river left looking downstream from the dam) and under the South Fork Flathead River on a line approximately 1400 feet in length and termninating on river right.  On river left, the bore path meets existing grade at approximate elevation 3112.  On river right, the bore path meets existing grade at approximate elevation 3163. The invert of the bore path is to be at least 50 feet below the thalweg of the river at approximate elevation 3000.  The contractor shall line the borehole with fusion welded HDPE pipe and install two separate 2-inch fusion welded SDR-9 HDPE pipes that will be used as forced sewer lines.  Bedrock consists of the Helena Formation of the Belt Supergroup (Middle Proterozoic), a moderately hard to very hard dolomite, with minor amounts of limestone, siltite, and argillite. On river left, where the bore path meets the existing grade, zero to 15 feet of granular materials may overlay bedrock. On river right, where the bore path meets the existing grade, 10 to 50 feet of granular materials may overlay bedrock. Granular materials are manmade fill or glacial outwash. Bedrock is exposed in the Flathead River.  Inactive faults are believed to exist that may be intercepted by the bore path.   Detailed geological information is available immediately upstream of the expected bore path alignment on river left.  A lesser degree of detailed geological information is available on the bore path alignment itself.  Hungry Horse Dam is located approximately 20 miles northeast of Kalispell, Montana, and 9 miles southeast of Columbia Falls, Montana, in Flathead County.  This acquisition will be a full-and-open, negotiated, best-value competition under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program and will not be set-aside.   We expect to make a contract award without holding discussions with offerors. The NAICS Code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, and the small business size standard is $31.0M.  The estimated range of the construction work is $100K - $250K. The solicitation may be available for download from the Federal Business Opportunities website - www.fbo.gov, on or about June 18, 2008.  Offers would be due on or about July 18, 2008.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.  All responsible sources may submit an offer for our consideration.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source modification to an existing contract.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract to the Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS), 460 Pierce Street, Monterey, CA, 93940 for an effort entitled Nonproliferation Study in The Area of Weapons of Mass Destruction.  The objective of this effort will be to leverage upon previous work conducted by CNS/MIIS to support DTRAs mission of conducting strategic studies and analyses related to national and international security, chemical, biological, nuclear, radiological, high-yield explosives (CBRNE) threats, homeland defense, and the global war on terrorism.  This effort includes state and non-state proliferation-related activities, and the means and capabilities necessary to effectively and efficiently combat both current and potential CBRNE threats. CNS/MIIS will conduct research, analyses, conferences, and provide expert services that encompass a wide range of WMD subjects in which CNS has unique expertise to meet the requirements of the Statement of Objectives, such as WMD threat anticipation, preparation, prevention, defense, reduction, nonproliferation, counter proliferation, consequence management, arms control and disarmament treaties and agreements, safety and security of WMD, and WMD development, production, deployment, transfers, reductions, and terrorism.  This effort will build upon research and analysis conducted between 2002 to 2006. During this period CNS/MIIS developed vital expertise and provided DTRA with comprehensive monitoring and analysis regarding global nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons issues, missile proliferation, and terrorist groups.  CNS/MIIS monitored the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their delivery missile systems (NBC/M) in which CNS/MIIS provided research and analysis on threats posed by the spread of NBC/M, its causes, ways to respond, and future challenges, including those involving Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), terrorism and ways to reduce the threats of WMD terrorism.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS, AND NO FORMAL SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROPRIATION H.R. 5631.

<DESC>This market survey advertisement is posted in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Policy 3.2.1
BACKGROUND
Cultural change is at the core of the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) ability to transform to a performance based organization.  The ATO has successfully implemented organizational changes at Headquarters, conducted a major consolidation of ATO support managers and staff regional office personnel to three Service Area Offices from nine locations, and is currently reengineering Service Center functions.  Cultural change initiatives in the last few years have focused on executive coaching, horizontal integration issues between service units and fostering effective leadership teams at the Service Area and the VP levels.  Several large communications outreach initiatives have been undertaken and cascaded throughout the organization.  These efforts were led by managers with the goal of educating, providing opportunities for dialogue, and providing mechanisms for upward feedback.  These communication sessions reached 1/3 of the workforce and focused on the compelling need for change, the direction and principles of the ATO, the plans in place to move the organization forward to a more customer-focused, results-oriented, and performance based culture.  Participants were engaged in discussions regarding cultural and behavioral shifts necessary in their facility/office to move the organization forward toward organizational goals.
A new ATO Chief Operating Officer has been selected.  He supports the changes that have occurred already and wants to further the progress the ATO has made.  He is interested in getting the ATO to operate as "One-ATO" both horizontally across service units and from the Vice President level down to the controller and technician level.  We are looking for support from the top of the organization with the Executive Council down to Front Line Managers in the field.  The effectiveness of leadership teams is always critical to organizational success and while we have made headways in the last few years in this regard, the restructuring also caused barriers.  It will be critical to get the Executive Leadership Team executing strategically and building the Service Area Leadership Council (The field Leadership Directors) to lead operations and execute well.
In the past, we have had executive coaching for all key executive VPs and Directors.  The coaching process needs to be up-leveled to include a very tangible and structured model for change and accountability to occur.  Employee surveys, site visits, manager feedback and interviews with the ATO's most senior leaders has revealed a reluctance to embrace the necessary changes because of learned behaviors and conditioned responses to the issues that arise in the organization.  A key requirement will be specialized training in executive coaching and a clear coaching model that influences change and can be measured.
PURPOSE
To meet the goal of transforming the ATO to a performance based organization, it is recognized that senior leaders need to understand the culture within the ATO, the desired behaviors that will complement the realignment currently underway, any anticipated obstacles, and model the corporate executive leadership and decision making that is needed from senior managers.
SCOPE OF WORK AND CAPABILITIES
FAA requires a skilled vendor to help us transform the culture of the FAA to a results-oriented, customer focused, and performance based organization.  This vendor will be required to work at every level of the organization and have the knowledge, training, skills and background to do large scale cultural transformation work.
A major requirement for this vendor is to have the specialized training credentials in executive coaching and building high performance teams.  The vendor not only has to have the training credentials of a professional executive coach but also the demonstrated ability to affect change and a clear and structured coaching model.  The vendor needs to have a high level of knowledge and experience in the field of organizational behavior and show examples of large scale cultural transformation initiatives they undertook and the positive results for the organization.
	Vendor will review documentation on FAA's strategic plans and objectives, including Mission, Vision, Values and Flight Plan, Strategic Management Plan (SMP), Business Goals, and Performance Objectives.	Vendor will review the ATO's employee perception survey (University of Maryland conducted in 2004) to understand the survey instrument and analyze the survey results.	Vendor will conduct interviews to gain an understanding of organizational issues.  Potentially interviews may be done with the senior leadership team to gain a solid understanding of the current situation with respect to each leader him/herself as well as opportunities and challenges each leader sees in the senior leader group working together to achieve successful culture change.  Focus groups may be used as well.	Vendor may also choose to conduct a series of interviews to assess the current environment, opportunities and needs at more operational levels.  Included will be interview with selected headquarters staff, interviews with three Service Area Directors and focus groups with mid level managers and individual contributors in those three Service Areas.	Vendor will provide one-on-one executive coaching with each member of the Executive Council.  This coaching will use a model that builds in accountability and has some sort of metric for improvement attached to it.	Vendor will recommend activities that have been specifically designed to accelerate the FAA culture change effort and produce measurable results in the most expeditious way possible.	Vendor will support on-call consultation to promote the FAA's expedited implementation of the cultural change recommendations.
The vendor will:  
	Develop a survey and assessment tool to measure organizational progress in becoming performance based.  Provide analysis and useable reports as a mechanism to leverage change.  Provide progress on agreed upon metrics and design and implement needed interventions to close gaps.	Deliver a recommended strategy for cultural change transformation.  This strategy should assist the agency in modeling, reinforcing and aligning critical leadership behaviors necessary for a cultural shift.

Vendor needs to be experienced in training methods and delivery and effective in gaining performance based results.  Vendor will provide own printing and participant materials for any training conducted.	Support the Change Management Team in developing initiatives that move metrics in the areas of "building a performance based culture" and "improving relationships between managers and employees"

<DESC>This Internet announcement is made pursuant to section 3.2.1.2.1 (Market Analysis) of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Acquisition Management System (AMS).  The FAA intends to extend the Automated Radar Terminal System - Version IE (ARTS IE) contract, DTFA01-03-D-03006, with Lockheed Martin Corporation for a period of 3 years from September 30, 2008 through September 29, 2011.  The ARTS IE is a Stand-Alone Tower Display System (SATDS) contract that was awarded for $7,249,967 to acquire a maximum of 30 NAS-certified ARTS IEs.  Currently, the FAA has ordered 7 ARTS IEs; therefore, the maximum quantities will remain the same for the contract's 3-year extension.
The SATDS is an interim solution that is intended for use in pre-existing Airport Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) not associated with a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility.  These ATCTs do not currently receive automation data from a TRACON.  These ATCTs generally have long range Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) coverage as opposed to short range Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) coverage.  However, the SATDS must provide the capability to receive and display aircraft position data to the ATCT controller from ARSR, ASR, or both systems.  The SATDS, as an interim solution, is to be eventually replaced by FAA's Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement (TAMR) program.  For the time frame under consideration for this extension, the ARTS IE systems will be getting flight plan information through Flight Data Input/Output from the FAA's En Route Automation system.
Functional requirements for the SATDS include, but are not limited to the following:  Conflict Alert (CA) safety functions; Mode C Intruder (MCI) safety functions; Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) safety functions; primary and secondary radar(s) target identification; alphanumeric capabilities (data blocks, lists); and weather information services.
In order to provide a certified ARTS IE system, using the FAA maintained Common ARTS IE/IIE/IIIE software and the hardware baseline currently deployed at FAA operational facilities that meets the requirements listed above, this offering is limited to vendors with existing, fielded, FAA-Certified, United States of America National Airspace System (NAS) real-time terminal air traffic control automation systems.  Vendors believing they possess the capability to meet this requirement should respond to this announcement with your firm's capabilities and experience in providing similar system(s) that meet the above requirements. The FAA will evaluate your response accordingly.  Responses must be submitted no later than JUNE 16, 2008, to Curtis Fields via e-mail at curtis.fields@faa.gov.  They may also be provided via express mail to the following address:

Bids will be reviewed by a committee and award will be made upon selection criteria defining the best benefit to the government. Description of Work-Perk Grindstone Matication unit 1 This contract is designed to reduce hazardous fuels, and restore public lands. The Perk Grindstone Mastication Project is described in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Perk-Grindstone Fuel Reduction Project.. The project will contribute to the central priority of restoration of fire-adapted systems by reducing intensities of wildfires, especially in the wildland urban interface (WUI) as well as Public lands, and restoring natural ecologic processes across a range of forest vegetation types. Additionally, the project would provide forest products to the local community and enhance watershed conditions (i.e., water quality and quantity). The project areas are within dense stands of mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and ponderosa pine associated woodlands that are at high risk of stress-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire. This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for tree mortality. Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will make the residual stand more fire resistant into the future and begin to restore natural function and sustainability. To accomplish these goals, this project includes treatment by mastication. Although burning is not apart of this Contract, many areas treated by this Contract is a preparatory step toward its use.

The project will contribute to the central priority of restoration of fire-adapted systems by reducing intensities of wildfires, especially in the wildland urban interface (WUI) as well as Public lands, and restoring natural ecologic processes across a range of forest vegetation types. Additionally, the project would provide forest products to the local community and enhance watershed conditions (i.e., water quality and quantity). The project areas are within dense stands of mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, and ponderosa pine associated woodlands that are at high risk of stress-induced bark beetle attack, as well as a risk of wildfire. This thinning will enhance residual tree vigor and thus reduce the chances for tree mortality. Treatment of the resulting woody debris and slash will make the residual stand more fire resistant into the future and begin to restore natural function and sustainability. To accomplish these goals, this project includes treatment by mastication. Although burning is not apart of this Contract, many areas treated by this Contract is a preparatory step toward its use.

<DESC>Synopsis of Proposed Competitive 8(a) Procurement of Detention Services at the El Paso Service Processing Center (SPC) located in El Paso, Texas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
The forthcoming solicitation will be for detention services to include officers, guards and transportation costs at the El Paso Service Processing Center in El Paso, Texas.  The procurement will be 8(a) competitive.  The solicitation is expected to be posted before April 1, 2008.  The period of performance is expected to be July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 for the base year plus four one year options.

The mission of the Detention and Removal Operations Program (DRO) is the planning, management, and direction of a broad program relating to the supervision, detention and deportation of aliens who are in the United States illegally.  These activities are chiefly concerned with enforcement of departure from the US of aliens who have entered illegally or have become removable after admission.  In implementing its mission, DRO is responsible for carrying out all orders for the required departure of aliens handed down in removal proceedings, or prior there to, and arranging for detention of aliens when such becomes necessary.  DRO maintains and operates the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS) to process cases located by the Border Patrol, Investigations and Inspections activities.  Investigative and Border activities locate aliens who are denied entry or further stay in the US and whose departure must be enforced.  The Contractor is required, in units housing ICE detainees, to perform in accordance with the most current editions of the ICE Detention Standards, American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (ALDF), and Standards Supplement, Standards for Health Services in Jails, latest edition, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC).  Some ACA standards are augmented by ICE policy and/or procedure.  In cases where other standards conflict with DHSIICE Policy or Standards, DHS/ICE Policy and Standards prevail.  ICE Inspectors will conduct periodic inspections of the facility to assure compliance of the aforementioned standards.

The Contractor shall furnish armed & unarmed detention officer services, including management personnel, supervision, manpower, relief officer, uniforms, equipment, and supplies to provide guard services seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours per day for the El Paso Service Processing Center.  The Contractor is responsible for record keeping services.  The El Paso Service Processing Center generally operates at an operational capacity of 800 detainees.  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of one Detention Officer of the same gender as the detainees on each post.  Detainees are classified as High (Level 3), Medium (Level 2), or Low Risk (Level 1).  It is imperative that assigned posts are properly covered at all times.  The Contractor shall provide its own fully operational and well-maintained equipment, supplies and forms that pertain to its own business enterprise.  Business activities may include replacing equipment and manpower to ensure full service at the ICE location.  The Contractor shall provide the transportation for detainees as described in the forthcoming solicitation.  In addition, the Contractor shall provide full and complete cooperation for any request or investigation conducted by the Government.

<SUBJECT>14 -- Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Sole Source Core Completion Contract
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-08-R-0001
<RESPDATE>040408
<ARCHDATE>05052008
<CONTACT>Chanda Tallman, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-1444, Email chanda.tallman@mda.mil
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program (MDA/GMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, Huntsville, Alabama, a new Core Completion Contract for the GMD program that will be comprised of four major work content elements. The four major work content areas that make up the Core Completion Contract include 1) the transfer of activity currently contracted for under HQ0006-01-C-0001 (critical activities necessary to complete the current spiral development), 2) Block 4 hardware and software, 3) European Interceptor Site integration support, and 4) Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities. The GMD Core Completion Contract will be a continuation of past and present BMDS development efforts to complete the current spiral development.
The proposed acquisition is directed to Boeing pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). These four major work content areas cannot be performed by any source other than Boeing without substantial and unacceptable programmatic risk, duplicative cost, and schedule delays. Only Boeing, the incumbent GMD System Prime contractor, has the necessary engineering, manufacturing, and software knowledge and expertise to perform and manage multiple major sub system developments, hardware/software programs and related integration activities without unacceptable delay to program schedules and unnecessary duplication of sunk development costs which cannot be recouped via competition. 

Boeing, as the current prime contractor for the operational capability, continuing spiral development and test of the GMD element of the BMDS, is the only qualified source to perform this completion effort within cost and schedule constraints. Furthermore, Boeing is the only source with the institutional technical knowledge that is critical for managing and integrating the completion of the ongoing development and fielding of the GMD System. Boeing is the only source with the engineering, manufacturing, software and fielding experience and expertise to conduct, manage and integrate the multiple major sub system developments, site design/build activities and related integration efforts without resulting in unacceptable program delays and enormous duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition. Duplication of prior development costs is unaffordable and would not be recoverable through competition for these requirements. There would be additional schedule and costs delays for the government to conduct extensive re-testing/re-validation to ensure the necessary GMD System capabilities, expertise and knowledge have been successfully transferred to any new system prime contractor. It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's critical schedule requirements and not disrupt current system operational capability.  

This proposed sole-source contract action does not preclude the on-going assessment of the future GMD potential competitive requirements which are a part of our current Request for Information (HQ0147-GMD-RFI-1). For the anticipated Core Completion Contract, a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract vehicle is contemplated. The anticipated period of performance to complete the current spiral development in the GMD Core Completion Contract covers 2nd quarter FY09 through 4th quarter FY13. Findings and conclusions from the on-going RFI are to be presented to a senior Integrated Product Team in the 3rd quarter FY 08 timeframe as a prelude to developing any competitive Request for Proposal(s) for competition candidate requirements.  

The proposed contract action is for work content for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are advised that the GMD program office is currently in spiral development and that adequate system documentation is not currently available. Interested parties who believe they can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost or schedule impacts to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Government's requirements. The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite GMD Sole Source Core Completion Contract Acquisition, and shall be emailed to Ms.Cathy Hill at cathy.hill@mda.mil and Ms.Chanda Tallman at chanda.tallman@mda.mil.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, as outlined above, which will be considered.  

This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.  

This action is not open to allied participation. See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to enter into negotiations on a non-competitive basis with GE Sensing/DRUCK Inc., New Fairfield, CT.  The government intends to procure 809 Intermediate-level ECP kits to be incorporated by the fleet at a rate of 100 kits per month to overcome corrosion and parts obsolescence issues currently affecting fleet availability of the GE Sensing/DRUCK Inc. designed 4508/U Air Data Test Set.  This revision will consist of replacing the pump head zinc die cast plate, tube fittings and the controller rack source pressure relief valve. In addition, the obsolete water separator and coalescing filter will be replaced with a combined cooler/water trap assembly.  GE Sensing/DRUCK Inc. will revise all affected engineering drawings and technical manuals.  As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), GE Sensing/DRUCK Inc. is the only manufacturer of this configuration. The government does not own the drawings. The Air Data Test Set was procured as a COTS item with minimal data requirements purchased. The proposed change is not form, fit, function related to the configuration, therefore the only design available is the GE Sensing/DRUCK Inc. developed kit.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider all responses received to this notice.  A determination by the government not to open the requirement to competition based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

This synopsis is for the establishment of a repair requirements contract for J52 Compressor Vanes. The solicitation will be issued with three base years and 2 one-year option periods executable at the Governments discretion. The total quantity for each NSN is the estimated quantity to be repaired over 5 years. The subject items requires Government source approval prior to contract award,  as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not  been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the "http://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" U.S. Navy Aviation Supply Office Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVICP-P at (215) 697-4243.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>Ticket Research Files
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFP-08-1074
<RESPDATE>061708
<CONTACT>S. Kyle Roberts, Email S.Kyle.Roberts@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a new sole source contract to Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (MPR) related to contract number 0600-03-60130, Evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program - Part A, Evaluation Implementation. The Part A Ticket Evaluation was awarded to MPR in 2003. That contract included tasks to use SSA data resources to design and build the Ticket Research File (TRF) annually between 2004 and 2007. SSA had expected to conclude the Part A Ticket Evaluation in 2008. However, as a result of recent changes to the Ticket to Work Program regulations, SSA will relaunch the  program, with implementation to begin in the summer of 2008.  As a result, SSA intends to modify the Part A Ticket Evaluation to extend  analysis through 2010 in order to assess the impact of the regulation changes to the ticket program. To support the extended ticket program analysis, SSA will need to build the TRF08 and TRF09. Although the TRF07  will not be needed for the ticket evaluation, that data is currently needed for various other SSA research and evaluation projects that have been using earlier versions of TRF data. It is therefore critical that SSA build the TRF07 to maintain  continuity of data for those other projects. SSA plans to remove the TRF construction process from the Part A Ticket Evaluation contract and sole source the construction of the TRF07-TRF09 to MPR. As part of this sole source contract, MPR will write and test detailed construction specifications for the TRF so that other firms may compete for contracts to construct anticipated future rounds of TRF data files (beyond 2009). 

Construction of the TRF is a highly complex task. Despite design specifications developed under the ticket evaluation design contract, it took MPR approximately 2 years to design and build the first TRF file, the TRF04. It is critical that the TRF07 be built by September 2008 to maintain data continuity for non-ticket research and evaluation projects. The TRF08-TRF09 must then be built by September 2009 and September 2010 respectively, and in sync with the Part A Ticket Evaluation, so that the evaluation contract remains on schedule. MPR is the only source capable of meeting this timeline based on their knowledge and experience in constructing and analyzing the TRF since 2004. 
BACKGROUND: On May 29, 2003 SSA awarded a 5-year contract to MPR for preparing data files from SSA administrative data and conducting the adequacy of incentives evaluation, process evaluation, participation analysis, and impact/outcomes analyses for the evaluation of the Ticket to Work Program. 

REQUIREMENTS: MPR shall build the TRF07-TRF09 in 2008-2010 to be consistent with the specifications of the TRF06. As part of the TRF07 data build, MPR shall develop detailed specifications on the steps necessary to build the TRF file, including data checking steps to assure the new data is consistent with prior TRF builds. MPR shall then test and refine the build specifications with the TRF08 and TRF09 data builds. Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required according to the necessary schedule (i.e., with the TRF07, TRF08, and TRF09 to be completed by September 2008, September 2009, and September 2010 respectively), should submit a capability statement to S. Kyle Roberts via email at s.kyle.roberts@ssa.gov. Responses shall be marked TRF07-09, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than June 17, 2008, 3:00PM EST. All responsible sources will be considered. If no responses are received by the cutoff date, a contract will be issued the MPR as referenced above. All questions must be submitted in writing to Kyle Roberts via the email address listed above. Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Communications-Engineering Research, Development and Engineering Center's Space and Terrestrial Communications Directorate will be hosting an Industry Day on Friday, 20 June 2008.  This is not a new contract opportunity. The purpose of this Industry Day is to make industry as well as the government aware of the existence and availability of technologies developed in support of the JTRS Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Radios.<BR> <BR>The Affordable Software Defined Radio (SDR) Components for JTRS Army Technology Objective - Manufacturing (ATO-M) is a ManTech effort initiated to reduce the risks of the JTRS HMS Small Form Fit (SFF) development. The SDR JTRS ATO-M is focused on reducing the Size, Weight and Power - Cost (SWAP-C) of the SFF core transceiver. The core transceiver will be reused throughout all variants of the JTRS SFF and therefore allows this ManTech effort to make the greatest possible impact on SWAP-C for the overall JTRS program.<BR><BR>The SDR JTRS ATO-M began in FY03 and has been working on four technology areas that relate to the core transceiver; Chip Scale Packaging (CSP) for the baseband processor, a 10W power amplifier based on GaN, wideband tunable RF filters, and an RF Integrated Circuit (RFIC) chipset. Great strides have been made in these technology areas and the SDR MTO would like to make industry as well as the government aware of their existence and availability.<BR><BR>The SDR JTRS ATO-M Industry Day will be held at the Myer Center of Ft. Monmouth, NJ on Friday, 20 June 2008. Attached is the Visitors Access Form required for non-government visitors at Fort Monmouth. Please RSVP to June Zimmerman by 13 June 2008 (732-427-2762, june.natalie.zimmerman@us.army.mil).

Specific tasks include:  1)  identify the length of time it takes newly deposited dredge material to become suitable Lark habitat and how long it remains suitable; 2) map current Lark occupation in relation to recent dredge material depositions sites; 3) compare vegetation characteristics of recent dredge material deposition sites to habitat characteristics previously identified as used by breeding Larks;  and  4) provide spatially and temporally explicit management guidelines in the form of a conservation planning document that can guide on-the-ground actions to create new and expand existing Lark habitat.  The document will establish management guidelines to aid future depositional actions relative to Streaked Horned Lark habitat management.  The document will identify opportunities for restoration as well as provide recommendations for sites where deposition will occur regarding what percent of the site area should be in specific conditions and the timing of appropriate deposition.  The RFQ is available with this announcement and is due 12 June 2008.  This procurement is set aside for small businesses.  The small business size standard for this procurement is a firm with average annual sales or receipts, including all affiliates, for the preceding three years not in excess of $6.5 million.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)The 827 ACSG Contracting Office Tinker AFB, OK is requesting information on replacement systems for 337 KC135R/T aircraft.  

PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to create a dialogue with industry.  With this notice, the 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the Block 45 program.  Your comments will help refine procurement strategy.  Block 45 is considering a performance-based procurement with a single contractor solely responsible for all aspects of the modification.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.     

DESCRIPTION

Block 45 is Increment 1 to KC-135 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Develop and field required capabilities to extend KC-135 as viable weapon system through 2040.  The Block 45 modification consists of four modifications that will
enable mitigation of capability gaps anticipated due to expected airspace restrictions of Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATM), resolve mission suitability shortfalls, shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability.  Block 45 includes (1) Digital Flight Director (DFD) includes replacing Angle of Attack (AOA); (2) Radar Altimeter (RA); (3) Autopilot (AP).

Services to include research and development, technology insertion, system integration, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support at Edwards AFB, studies/analyses, logistic support services, training and engineering support services, including re-engineering and reverse engineering, for a range of equipment.  Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrades and operational support costs. 

Modification Installation effort:  At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities.   A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities.  Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government.  The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  

Businesses with the capability of providing the required services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates their ability to fulfill this requirement, information concerning performance-based contract measurement recommendations, contract type, and any other relevant recommendations.

<DESC><p>Solicitation No.: FA2550-08-R-8002
<p>Acquisition Title: EHF SATCOM Support and Engineering Services (ESSES)</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 541330 - Engineering Services</p>
<p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (SAFB), Colorado, is continuing its market research in order to fully capture market capabilities with respect to the ESSES requirements listed below. This Sources Sought Notice is issued for the purpose of market research IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All large and small businesses capable of providing these services are encouraged to respond.<br />All parties who responded to the previous Sources Sought Notice, MECSS-08, entitled: "Milstar Engineering and Communications Services Support (MECSS)", are asked to reconfirm their original submission, and are welcome to submit additional information as appropriate. Respondents to this notice should indicate whether they qualify as a large or small business under NAICS Codes 541330 - Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons - size standard $25M). Small business respondents should indicate whether they are a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), HUB-Zone certified, small disabled veteran, a woman-owned, or a Historically Black College or university.</p>
<p>Service Characteristics</p>
<p>Milstar is a joint service satellite communications system that provides secure, jam resistant, worldwide communications to meet essential wartime requirements for high priority military users. The multi-satellite constellation links command authorities with a wide variety of resources, including ships, submarines, aircraft and ground stations, providing interoperable encrypted voice, data, teletype or facsimile communications among the users of Army, Navy, and Air Force Milstar terminals. These links are used for a multitude of operations, from calling in Theater Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and air strikes from forward deployed fire teams, to national command and control messaging, through missile defense and Presidential communications links. Continued operation of the current MECSS contract (now ESSES) is critical to national security and vital to our national economic interests. Immediate execution of these requirements is therefore crucial - any delay or degradation of service would immediately and directly result in serious loss of military capabilities, assets, intelligence and personnel, and recovery time for tactical and strategic nets would suffer extended outages. These links also face severe cryptographic problems if the personnel on the proposed ESSES contract are unable to deliver Cryptographic Key Allocation Tables. Without this capability many terminals would be unable to receive the correct crypto keys that will allow access to the satellite. Milstar is the primary survivable communications provider for missile warning networks - these are the highest priority networks for national security. Contractor support must demonstrate a thorough understanding of Milstar and AEHF systems, and the missions of both 4 SOPS and the 614 SCS. The majority of contractor resources will be employed within a Restricted Area at both the Secret and Top Secret/SCI levels. The contractor must have on staff, or have the ability to hire and retain, personnel to perform the work with the required clearances. The core support personnel will be required to work with day-staff on-site primarily at Schriever AFB, Colorado.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor must possess technical capabilities in the following areas:</p>
<p>(1) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate technical knowledge of Extremely High Frequency (EHF) waveform and emerging Milstar Satellite System programs and future protected-communications systems (i.e. AEHF)<br />(2) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate relevant experience in operational, tactical, and strategic communications planning as it applies to the joint Milstar mission.<br />(3) Experience in classroom instruction.<br />(4) Develop new course materiel to include AEHF. <br />(5) Develop new processes to accommodate legacy users into the combined Milstar - AEHF Constellation.<br />(6) Develop processes, products, and procedures for incorporating AEHF into the day-to-day mission of 4 SOPS Communications Operations.<br />(7) Research new technologies that would allow for more efficient dissemination of Milstar and AEHF information to the warfighter and 50 SW.<br />(8) Develop new processes and procedures as 4 SOPS takes on an expanded Cryptographic mission with the deployment of AEHF terminals.<br />(9) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate relevant experience in the development of operational mission planning and resource monitoring tools to evaluate and recommend changes/improvements to AEHF satellite communications systems hardware and software.<br />(10) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate relevant experience with fielding and on-orbit support of new satellite communications systems to provide research, engineering, and technical studies for the development of future EHF and Transformational Communications Systems.<br />(11) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate relevant experience in the development of software interfaces for satellite communications payload to enhance mission capabilities.<br />(12) The ability to demonstrate Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal (SMART-T), Single Channel Manned Portable (SCAMP), and Air Force Command Post terminals operations, Navy Extremely High Frequency Satellite Communications Program (NESP).<br />(13) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate terminal control software operations.<br />(14) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate DoD Automated Message Handling System (AMHS) message development and handling operations.<br />(15) Expertise with Ground Mobile Deployment operations.<br />(16) Expertise and/or the ability to operate cryptographic equipment utilized for EHF.<br />(17) Expertise with Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine EHF operations. <br />(18) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate web server administration and website development<br />(19) Expertise and/or the ability to demonstrate Defensive Counter Space communications expertise.</p>

<CONTACT>Timothy E Pink, Supervisory Procurement Analyst, Phone DSN 833-0007, Email timothy.pink@losangeles.af.mil - Marilyn K. Washington, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 653-2072, Email marilyn.washington@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>Satellite Control and Network Systems Group (SCNG) intends to issue a contract action for the procurement of eleven (11) follow-on telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&amp;C) core electronics and antennas, plus one (1) additional transportable RBC antenna for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) Remote Tracking Station (RTS) Block Change (RBC). The proposed action will be awarded as a new Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC), and will be a Fixed-Price Incentive contract for satellite and network control services and support. The original ordering period on the SCNC contract has expired due to Government funding constraints and the complexity of RBC development.</p>
<p>This effort involves the procurement and fielding of the core electronics and antenna facilities for 11 AFSCN ground stations with possible options to enhance the network's capability by fielding more ground stations world wide. The AFSCN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides TT&amp;C, mission data dissemination, and processing. It is also one of the nation's primary high-powered networks for emergency anomaly resolution of space vehicles.</p>
<p>The AFSCN currently consists of legacy Automatic Remote Tracking Stations (ARTS) and is undergoing a modernization to state-of-the-art tracking stations (RBC upgrade). There are five (5) RBC antennas, one (1) transportable RBC antenna, one (1) RBC Integration and Support Suite (RISS), and one (1) Eastern Vehicle Checkout Facility (EVCF) RBC project currently on contract. This next contract will continue the modernization effort for the rest of the AFSCN by replacing the remaining legacy ARTS core electronics and antenna systems with RBC systems and adding new, additional remote tracking stations to the network. This core electronics and antenna upgrade will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Project Management<br />2. Project Systems Engineering<br />3. Configuration Management<br />4. Hardware Design &amp; Development<br />5. Software Design &amp; Development<br />6. Procurement<br />7. Production<br />8. System Integration, Assembly, Checkout, &amp; Shipping<br />9. Test &amp; Evaluation<br />10. Data &amp; Documentation<br />11. Integration Logistics Support<br />12. Environmental Engineering Compliance<br />13. Site Acquisition, Installation, &amp; Acceptance</p>
<p>The value for these supplies and services is estimated at $338,000,000.</p>
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether potential offerors exist that are capable of achieving program objectives within acceptable cost, performance, and schedule parameters. Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. (HTSI) was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC) in December 2001 and is presently on contract for development of the first five (5) RBC articles. Due to requirements and schedule changes, the ordering period for the remaining eleven (11) RBC articles has expired. The nature of this acquisition is unique due to the complexity of integrating both legacy and systems currently in development. HTSI has performed identical work on the previous RBC articles. All responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) that will be considered. The Government anticipates that there may be a small percentage of set-asides for this action. Responses from small and small disadvantaged<br />businesses are encouraged. The current expected contract order award date is the first or second quarter of fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p>Responsible sources interested in this notice may submit their SOC with documented evidence of their capability to meet all cost, performance, and schedule requirements electronically no later than 11 Jun 2008 to the Points of Contact (POC) listed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. RBC Requirements Document (RD)<br />2. Transportable RBC Unique &amp; Common Requirements<br />3. Waivers/Requirements Clarifications<br />4. AFSCN CONOPS</p>

Include a summary of cost, schedule and technical risks associated with the SOC program plan.<br />4. Past Performance: Outline relevant and recent experience in AFSCN RBC, or equivalent command and control (C2) project, development and integration. Include a list of points of contact (POC) with phone numbers and email addresses. <br />5. Personnel and Facilities: Describe ability to provide qualified personnel and facilities to work at the appropriate security level. <br />6. Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost Estimate: Explain cost savings expected due to realization of learning curve.</p>
<p>All responses must be signed, scanned, and submitted by email to the POCs listed below in MS Word or PDF format, conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with no smaller than 12 point font. All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed fifty (50) one-sided pages. The Government will not consider pages in excess of this limitation.</p>
<p>All submitted SOCs will be evaluated to establish a pool of sources capable of supporting this requirement; small businesses that submit a SOC should indicate if they are interested as either potential prime contractor or subcontractor. The Government will then determine extent of competition based on, but not limited to, availability of responsible qualified sources and integration capabilities. This determination is solely within the discretion of the Government. The selection of one or more sources for determination of competition will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's SOC to determine the overall merit of capability. The SOCs will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Minimal duplication costs for RBC development.<br />2. Ability to maintain schedule requirements and meet delivery date for at least one (1) RBC site per year starting in FY11 and two (2) RBC sites per year starting in FY13. <br />3. Capability of meeting requirements and performance parameters as listed in the provided attachments.<br />4. Capability for seamless integration into the AFSCN RBC architecture.</p>
<p>DECLARATION: Submit questions to the e-mail addresses below. This synopsis is not a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this synopsis, or to otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit comments from potential sources from academia and industry on the solicitation approach and the clarity of the High Performance Computing Modernization Program Offices (HPCMPO) draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) Program.   This RFI and the SOO may be viewed on the DoD HPCMP web site at http://www.hpcmo.hpc.mil/PETTT business_opps.htm .  The HPCMPO was established in 1993 to perform life cycle management and acquisition oversight for the High Performance Computing (HPC) needs of the defense Science and Technology (S&T) and Test and Evaluation (T&E) communities.  The purpose of the PETTT Program is to enable the flow of computational science and related technology and help fulfill the research and development objectives of the DoD high performance computing user community.  PETTT will focus on enhancing user productivity through technology transition, training and support.  The predecessor contract of the User Productivity Enhancement, Technology Transfer and Training (PETTT) activity has introduced tools and techniques from various computational communities and brokered collaborative activities with government agencies, industry, and academia.  The PETTT activity under this solicitation will further facilitate collaborations among DoD researchers and world-class institutions on computational problems of significant interest for national defense.  The Government anticipates the following solicitation approach for the PETTT contract: (1) this RFI, (2) a pre-proposal Bidders Response identifying a technical/management approach based on the SOO, and (3) a formal Technical/Management and Cost Proposal based on a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government will hold one-on-one bidders conferences with prospective bidders during the pre-proposal phase as well as the RFP phase.  Based on the bidders responses and the bidders conference during the pre-proposal phase, the Government will generate a Performance Work Statement (PWS).  This, together with the SOO will dictate the Governments requirements for PETTT and form the basis for a formal request for proposals (RFP) in accordance with the procedures set forth in the FAR Part 15.  The Government anticipates awarding a single Award Fee contract with a Base and four option periods. The Government envisions that the most productive form of the contract will result from a consortium of university and industry partners.  The expected award date is May 2009.  This is a Request for Information only.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this posting.
Written responses to this RFI may be submitted to the General Services Administration, Federal Acquisition Services, Assisted Acquisition Services Division, 950 22nd Street North, Suite 600, Birmingham, AL 35203, Attn. Ms. Deborah Joeckel, by 15 June 2008.  Electronic copies are preferred and should be sent via e-mail to eddie.mills@gsa.gov with a copy to deborah.joeckel@gsa.gov in PDF format.

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) to provide The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with expert consultants to provide technical assistance in identifying, developing, enhancing, applying or evaluating a wide range of quantitative and qualitative methods drawn from decision science, risk analysis, social science, health outcomes research, health economics and other analytic disciplines.

B. Objectives:

The main objectives of this study would be to: 


1. Explore linking the STS clinical data to the CMS administrative claims data and/or other long-term clinical/administrative data. 

2. Based on the demographic and clinical information from the STS Database (age, admission diagnosis, date of surgery, date of discharge, etc), match the database patient to the same patient in the administrative data set. 

3. Use the STS Database to determine the device and clinical characteristics and severity-of-illness factors of a patient, and use the administrative data to determine the clinical course of that patient over the following years.
 
        
Methods: Specific information to be collected by the STS database includes

&#61607;	Demographic characteristics
&#61607;	Device characteristics
&#61607;	Pre-operative risk factors
&#61607;	History of previous interventions
&#61607;	Pre-operative cardiac status
&#61607;	Pre-operative hemodynamics
&#61607;	Operative procedure
&#61607;	Post-operative medications
&#61607;	Adverse events
&#61607;	Discharge data
&#61607;	Status at 30 days post-procedures
&#61607;	Long-term outcomes (based on the CMS data) 

A statistical technique called probabilistic matching will enable STS to use administrative data to follow patients for an extended period of time.  Demographic and clinical information on patients in the STS Database (age, admission diagnosis, date of surgery, date of discharge, etc) can be used in a well-accepted statistical technique to match the database patient to the same patient in the administrative data set.  The probability of a correct match is in the range of 99%.  With this matching process, it becomes possible to use the STS Database to determine the clinical characteristics and severity-of-illness factors of a patient, and use the administrative data to determine the clinical course of that patient over the following years.

C. Statement of Work:
The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things, except as provided in the schedule, necessary for or incident to the performance of the work as described below.  The contractor shall be prepared to develop a response to individual tasks as they are assigned.  

Please see that attached document which contains the Statement of Work and deliverables by Task order 1. 
D. Project Background:

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) is a not-for-profit organization representing more than 5,400 surgeons, researchers, and other health professionals worldwide who are performing heart, lung, esophageal, and other surgical procedures for the chest. The mission of STS is to enhance the ability of cardiothoracic surgeons to provide the highest quality patient care through education, research, and advocacy.  The STS offers outcome programs in the areas of Adult Cardiac, General Thoracic and Congenital Heart-defect surgery. 

The STS National Database is a comprehensive national registry that collects information from over 600 participating hospitals on patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Since 2003, the Registry collected information on over 1,800,000 procedures. It is a confidential, voluntary, and national in scope. As an independent source of information on patients undergoing cardio-thoracic surgeries, this registry is superior to manufacturer initiated studies (both FDA mandated and voluntary).  

The analytical support for the STS National database is conducted by the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI).  Since 1994, there have been over 50 of publications in peer-reviewed journals resulting from the studies conducted through this Registry.   The FDA in mid-1990s very successfully studied Transmyocardial Revascularization (TMR) devices in using the data from the STS registry to obtain valuable information that supplemented FDA postmarket surveillance programs.  

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) administrative claims data. contain long-term patient information that includes hospital admissions, admission diagnoses, and other information that can be used to determine clinical events over time. 

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) would like to collaborate with the STS in studying the experience of patients receiving various medical devices during cardio-thoracic procedures.


E. Contract period of performance

The study will begin in September 2008. The duration of the first task of this five- year  
  contract will be two years.    


F. Procurement/Contract Strategy:

It is anticipated that a contract indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity task order contract. The contract will have a period of performance of 1 base year with 4 option years. This is a new requirement.  The NAICS Code is 813920, with a small business size standard of $6.5 mil.

G. Capability Statement Requirements:
Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice.  However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required.  Responses must directly demonstrate the companys capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above while in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 (Limitations on Subcontracting).  Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work.

Respondents must address their capability, experience and knowledge directly correlated to the Statement of Work. Interested offerors should submit their capability statement not exceeding fifteen (15) pages in length, excluding standard brochures.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Office of International and Academic Affairs, intends to negotiate with Westat Inc., Rockville, MD, on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1).  The goal of the acquisition is to conduct a study to assess a two-week Summer Institute held by NIST for Montgomery County Public School staff.  The evaluation of the program will examine the implementation of the NIST Summer Institute and assess its efficacy in improving participating MCPS middle school teachers content knowledge and instructional practices in science.  The contractor will assess differences between the study group and a control group in terms of changes in instructional practice and content knowledge over the course of the academic year, while also collecting data on teachers professional development experiences.

The incumbent, Westat Inc., has developed a relationship with the 2007 participants in the program, and a part of the next phase of the assessment plan involves not only the new participants for the 2008 Summer Institute, but also a follow-up assessment with the 2007 participants.  If a new contractor were to take over the assessment at this point, more financial resources would need to be expended than planned to bring the assessment efforts to the same point as they are currently.  In addition, increased time and expenditure of staff resources would also occur.  The current contractor has developed continuing contacts with the staff and first group of participants, which will greatly facilitate continuation of the assessments.

The performance of the activities described require a contractor with current knowledge in educational issues in science and mathematics.  The success of this evaluation has also required a contractor with technical expertise in research design, development of outcome measures and appropriate baselines, and the demonstrated ability to isolate program effects from exogenous factors.  The current contractor, Westat, is not only a leader in the aforementioned areas, but also a leader in assessment of elementary and secondary education programs, including numerous national and international comparative studies of student achievement, and with the U.S. Department of Education I the Academic Improvement and Teacher Quality program.  Westat has demonstrated these capabilities during the first assessment year and is well-qualified to continue the project.  Based on these reasons, NIST believes that only Westat can satisfy NISTs requirement to complete this study.

The NAICS Code is 541690 with a Size Standard of $6.5 million.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price type purchase order for a base period of one year and one one-year option to extend the term of the contract.     

Interested parties may identify their interest; however, such parties must clearly and unambiguously demonstrate their ability to perform the requirement in writing no later than the response date in order to be considered. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.  Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Jill Johnson at jill.johnson@nist.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division - Orlando (NAWCTSD-Orlando) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQ) with the Bell Boeing Joint Program Office located in Amarillo, TX under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".  The anticipated ceiling amount for this contract is $200M.  The supplies to be procured under this ID/IQ include the acquisition of Air Force (CV) Flight Training Devices (FTDs) Serial Numbers 5 and 6, Marine Corps (MV) Cabin Part Task Trainer (PTT) Device Serial Number 1, CV Cabin PTTs Device Serial Numbers 2 and 3, MV Aircraft Maintenance Trainer Device Serial Number 4 and a CV Wing PTT.  Aircraft driven concurrency revisions will be incorporated on these devices, as well as the Landing Gear PTT, Mechanical PTT, Airframes PTT, Power Plant Training Article, Consolidated V-22 Electronics Maintenance Trainer and MV Aircraft Maintenance Trainers.  Also, Aircraft Common Operational Equipment (ACOE) and provisioned items (spares), as required for operational support, will be procured.  The Bell-Boeing JPO has been the sole designer, developer, weapons system integrator, and producer of the MV-22 and CV-22 type/model/series aircraft.  As such, Bell Boeing is the only responsible source possessing the engineering data, technical skills, requisite knowledge of the design, fabrication, performance, and operational characteristics of the V-22 aircraft.  As part of the aircraft procurement program, BB JPO has developed and built all V-22 aircrew and maintenance trainers acquired to date.  BB JPO creates V-22 aircraft systems software and modifies the aircrafts System Configuration Set (SCS) to include Operational Flight Programs (OFPs) (eg JASS) software. BB JPO provides software for design, engineering simulations, and operational evaluation that are used in the redesign of the V-22 aircraft.  These redesigned subsystem models are used to develop and test the SCS/OFP and are an essential element used in the development of V-22 aircraft and training systems.  The complexity and evolving nature of the V-22 aircraft requires that training systems and training are developed and implemented concurrently with the aircraft.  Aircrew and maintenance training systems need to provide a robust, dynamic and accurate representation of the delivered aircraft and associated subsystems prior to or when delivered to the fleet.  BB JPO needs to replicate the performance of the aircraft systems and enable the production, revision, test, evaluation and acceptance of the training capability in order to deliver the required training capability concurrent with the aircraft development/production.  The V-22 training system is designed and developed based on parallel and spiral efforts contracted under the aircraft procurement program resulting in training devices that are unique stand-alone and concurrent with the aircraft.  These devices essentially represent exact replicas of the aircraft or portions of the aircraft.  This requirement to accurately and concurrently represent the aircraft and aircraft systems necessitates a sole source relationship with the aircraft OEM.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Lisa Nelson lisa.l.nelson@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2000, no later than 16 June 2008 at 1600.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than five (5) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation document is available.  If no affirmative written response is received, the ID/IQ contract for the V-22 Training Aircraft Program will be awarded without further notice.

 Ergonomic Furniture Financial and Installation Tracking Systems Requirements
Request for Information



The Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks information on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions to provide automated computer software that will track all aspects of furniture installation including installation, financial and warranty activity.    

BACKGROUND

The Center for Ergonomic Property (CEP) manages the installation of ergonomic systems workstations in more than 1,700 large and small offices nationwide. An installation can range from approximately 30-1700 workstations. There are approximately 30 types of installations . Major installations include:
	Initial installation - installation of all new ergonomic systems workstations.
	Relocation - dismantling workstations at the current site, transporting the product to the new site and joining original product with new product to use for installation.
	Reconfiguration - a change in the layout of the workstations at the current site.
	Retrofit - addition of product to previously installed workstations.
	Add-on - installation of additional workstations at the current site.  

CEP identifies the office and the type of installation with site codes.  Larger offices may have several site codes. Coordinating nationwide installations require access to office information such as site code; office address; region name; and contact information for the designer, local coordinator and regional coordinator. CEP currently relies on two custom applications to support the day-to-day operations.  These applications contain approximately 5,510 furniture records and 12,610 financial records.  

As a part of the furniture installation process, CEP monitors the preparation, revision and final approval of the computer-aid design (CAD) drawings.  The approval date and any revision dates of the CAD drawing are tracked and maintained.  CEP monitors the dates of site design visits or conference calls, requisitions and task orders, inventory visits, pre-install meetings and installation completion visits or go-backs, rescheduling when needed.   

Within each contract, there are required milestones that CEP monitors such as the CAD certification and the generation of the bill of materials (BOM).  The CAD certification must occur before the BOM can generate.  The BOM is the complete list of all product required to install the ergonomic systems workstations shown on the CAD.  Furniture production starts when the contractor receives the BOM.  Once the designer generates the BOM, the contractor has 120 calendar days to manufacture and deliver the furniture.  Prior to the generation of the BOM, CEP tracks the date of the generated BOM and all additions to the BOM to ensure that the furniture production and delivery takes place in a timely manner.  

SSA acquires ergonomic systems furniture from two separate sources utilizing two different contracting methods, an Interagency Agreement (IAA) and a commercial contract.  SSA allocates funding via Common Accounting Numbers (CANs).  The CAN is a code used in all accounting transactions to identify the appropriation, allotment, allowance, organization, and other pertinent data.  Acquisitions typically include design, installation, product specified in a Bill of Materials (BOM) and designer/installer travel expenses. CEP provides estimated travel expenses on orders for design and installation services.  When the contractor invoices for the travel expenses, the actual may be less than estimated.  In this case, CEP needs to de-obligate the excess funds for use elsewhere.  Currently, SSA tracks this information via a spreadsheet that includes:

	Order number
	Site name and code
	Estimated travel cost
	Actual travel cost
	Amount to be de-obligated
	Date of completion and
	90 days from date of completion

Additionally, CEP keeps an accounting of all financial figures connected with each installation including:
	the cost of product
	storage fees
	estimated and actual travel expenses for the designer and installer
	designer and installation service fees
	task and work order numbers
	common accounting numbers (CAN)  

CEP conducts periodic quality assurance visits and distributes informational materials for offices receiving ergonomic systems workstations.  SSA distributes by email informational reports listing pending installations and instructional guidelines for distributing the informational materials.

CEP coordinates all warranty requests for ergonomic systems workstations.  This requires the ability to annotate the description of the needed repair, the regional coordinator contact information, the installer contact information, the date of the warranty visit and the completion date of the warranty visit.

SCOPE OF WORK

SSA requirements involve an accurate COTS system to house and integrate systems furniture installation and financial records.  SSA is interested in replacing the existing software with COTS software that will allow SSA to take advantage of the latest software developments.

TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE 

The objective is to acquire COTS software that has certain basic technical features.  The COTS software must:
	Be web-enabled with access using Microsoft Internet Explorer
	Operate in a multi-user mode 
	Include user and administrator documentation along with an online step-by-step users manual and online learning functions or tutorials
	Enable users to be able to query the tracking system using any combination of a variety of search criteria to find specific installation and financial information about all systems furniture installations, such as:
o	Installation date
o	Bill of Materials information
o	Warranty issues
o	Total installation cost by site code by fund
o	Total installation cost by fiscal year
o	Site code or action code
o	Task or work order number
o	Fiscal year
o	IAA
o	CAN (fund)
	Be 508 compliant
	Allow users to download reports with cover letters and send electronically via Microsoft Outlook 2003 email
	Provide a reporting tool that allows users the flexibility to display report data utilizing user-selected fields, such as:
o	Site name
o	Site code
o	Bill of Materials date
o	Pre-installation date
o	Number of workstations
o	Furniture install date
	Allow users the flexibility to display reports using accounting structures with any combination of data, such as:
o	Total installation cost by CAN (Fund) 
o	Total installation cost by fiscal year
o	CAN (Fund)
o	Fiscal year
o	Site or action code
o	Task or work order number
o	IAA
	Be able to be modified if necessary
	Provide various levels of access to the financial tracking portion of the system (e.g. read only and add/delete/modify).
	Enable users to add, edit, delete, save and print records
	Produce reports highlighting timeline constraints which are in jeopardy
	Provide error checking such as not allowing duplicate site codes
	Migrate existing data
	Be Microsoft Windows XP and Vista compliant

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Toxoplasma Serology Laboratory, 795 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA, 94301-2302, for an ocular toxoplasmosis study to determine the proportion of patients with toxoplasmic chorioretinitis who are infected post-natally (versus congenitally). The background for this study is as follows: Toxoplasma gondii is considered the most common etiologic agent of posterior uveitis in the United States (approximately 25%) and worldwide (up to 85%) [1, 2]. Toxoplasmic chorioretinitis can result in significant visual disturbances including clinically significant relapses and blindness [3-6]. Active chorioretinal lesions may result from congenital or postnatally acquired infection. In both of these situations, lesions may occur during the acute stage of the infection or as a relapse of the latent (chronic) phase of the infection. Retinal scars (asymptomatic latent infection) can be serendipitously observed on a routine ophthalmological exam or during the evaluation of other ocular pathology. Thus, ocular toxoplasmosis can occur in the setting of five different clinical scenarios: 1) chorioretinitis can be discovered at birth in a newborn congenitally infected with the parasite; 2) chorioretinitis may not be evident at birth but reactivation of congenital disease can occur later in life, usually between the ages of 10 to 30 years; 3) chorioretinitis can be manifested in association of an acute post-natally acquired infection. We and others have reported that this presentation usually occurs in individuals older than 50 years of age [7, 8]; 4) reactivation of a previous post-natally acquired infection; 5) an asymptomatic scar is incidentally discovered in a routine eye exam. In the first four clinical scenarios treatment may be indicated particularly when lesions threaten the macula or central vision whereas in patients without symptoms drug therapy is not offered. For many years the traditional view and teaching has been that the vast majority of patients with ocular toxoplasmosis were infected congenitally (clinical scenarios 1 and 2, see above) [1, 2]. Recently, investigators from Europe and the United States have reported a significant number of patients with eye disease associated with infection acquired post-natally, either accompanying the acute infection or reactivating a latent infection (clinical scenarios 3 and 4, see above) [7, 8]. T. gondii can occur in nature in three distinct genetic lineages (types I to III) which may identify clinically relevant biological differences. Type I or type I/III atypical strains appear to be responsible for most of the ocular disease reported in the literature [9, 10]. Recently, the CDC laboratory has optimized a novel technique that would allow to establish whether a patient is infected with type II vs type I/III strain of the parasite using only a serum sample [11]. A study attempting to establish how much of the ocular disease caused by T. gondii is due to the post-natal acquisition of the infection vs congenital and the type of parasite strain affecting acutely infected patients in the United States has not been attempted so far. Distinguishing between post-natally acquired vs congenital infection has major implications in establishing national priorities for disease prevention. [References: 1.

J Infect Dis 2003;187:1484-95.] The main aim of this study is to determine the proportion of patients with toxoplasmic chorioretinitis who present to different ophthalmology clinics or centers across the United States as a result of a post-natally acquired acute infection. The secondary purposes are as follows: 1. To establish whether important geographical differences exist in the United States in terms of proportion of patients presenting with ocular toxoplasmosis as a result of post-natally acquired disease. 2. To determine whether patients with ocular disease as a result of a recently acquired infection are parasitemic as measured by polymerase chain reaction. 3. To determine the serotype of the strain of T. gondii affecting patients in the United States with toxoplasmic chorioretinitis in the setting of acute infection. The scope of work is as follows: Patients will be identified with T. gondii-associated ocular disease at the participating centers. The vendor will perform anti-Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibody testing, and for those sera with positive anti-Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibodies perform the full Toxoplasma testing panel, which includes the dye test (if not done previously), avidity test, IgE ELISA, IgA ELISA, and differential agglutination (AC/HS). For serum samples that are anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM positive the vendor will perform (or subcontract to perform) a series of peptide-specific serologic tests to determine if the infection is due to genetic types 1 and 3, or type 2 T. gondii. Also for serum samples that are anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM positive, the vendor will perform polymerase chain reaction testing on whole blood to determine if patients are parasitemic. These data will then be entered into computer software, which shall be provided to CDC, and periodic summary reports will be made to CDC. Task to be performed in this requirement are as follows: 1. Collaborate with the CDC on the study design and data collection instrument. 2. On an annual basis, request renewal of human subjects board approval from all involved study sites. Forward letter of renewal to the CDC IRB annually or as required by the CDC IRB. 3. Perform anti-Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibody testing on samples from at least 50 additional persons with ocular toxoplasmosis (in addition to the 100 persons in the FY07 contract), and for those sera with positive anti-Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibodies perform the full Toxoplasma testing panel, which includes the dye test (if not done previously), avidity test, IgE ELISA, IgA ELISA, and differential agglutination (AC/HS). Also, for serum samples that are anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM positive the vendor will perform (or subcontract to perform) a series of peptide-specific serologic tests to determine the genetic types of T. gondii, and perform polymerase chain reaction testing for T. gondii. The estimated period of performance is nineteen months. CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. AG-5114-S-08-BB02 is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516. For a company to qualify as a small business, the small business standard is 500 employees or less. The USDA, ARS, MWA, Photosynthesis Research Unit, Urbana, IL has a requirement/need for an automated Liquid Handling System which needs to be a bench-top automated liquid handling station for precision dispensing of liquids.  The station will be used for increasing the throughput and efficiency of biochemical assays, DNA, and RNA applications. THE SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS: the automated Liquid Handling System  must meet or exceed these minimum requirements: 1) The system should be capable of aspirating from and dispensing into 96, 384 and 1536 well SBS microplates.  It must be capable of pipetting volumes between 0.5 and 235 microliters while achieving a precision better than 2% CV at 1.0 microliter. The system should have a deck capacity of no less than 15 SBS plate positions. 2) The system should offer the ability to use either 96 or 384 multi-channel dispense heads which can be changed within a protocol, on the fly under software control and require no user intervention or recalibration of the system when doing so. 3) The system should allow loading a single column or row of tips for serial dilution procedures as well as any user defined well pattern. 4) The system should include a means to move plates and tips to all deck locations and allow moving of plates with tips attached to dispense head. 5) The system should allow for pre-aspirate and post dispense mixing as well as multiple dispenses from a single aspirate. 6) The system must include a tip wash station that refills the wash reservoir with fresh wash solution after each wash sequence. 7) The system should provide a means to add a 384 channel dispense head capable of volumes between 50 nanoliters and 1 microliter with software selectable volumes in 10 nanoliter steps. 8) A single position shaker for microplates is required and can be turned on and/or off within a protocol by instrument software. Speed 100  2000 rpm; amplitude 2 mm and self centering. 9) The system should allow for future addition of storage devices capable of delivering automation friendly microplates and/or tip boxes. When storage devices are employed, the dispense head shall be able to pipette to and from the microplate while still on the diving board. 10) The system software should include a library of labware files which allows addressing microplates, deep well plates, reagent reservoirs and 1.5 microliter tubes. It shall also allow creating customer defined labware profiles for optimizing aspirate and dispense heights. 11) The system must provide automated temperature control between 4 and 70 degrees C for cooling/heating of no less than four microplate positions which can be accessed by the dispense head. The temperature set points must be stored within a protocol and monitored by the system software to prevent executing a protocol before the desired temperature is achieved. To ensure uniform cooling across the plates the temperature control device should include adapters for flat bottom and PCR plates as well as 1.5 microliter tubes.  Three adapters for flat bottom plates, one adapter for a 96 well PCR plate and one adapter for 1.5 microliter microfuge tubes are to be included in the proposal. 12) All robotic movements shall be stored in a database to enable verification of pipetting actions and plate movement. These entries shall include time and date stamping as well as grid position. The software should be capable of generating post run reports which include pipetting steps and any system errors which may have occurred. 13) The software should provide the option of ejecting tips in their rack for re-use or disposing to waste.  Disposable tips should be in an automation friendly format. 14) The instrument control software should be built around a graphical user interface with pull-down menus and be compatible with Windows XP. The software should also enable creating customized dialog boxes to inform users of assembly changes or tip/reagent replenishment requirements. The system software should be able to easily conduct file importation routines with single point insertion for common file type (e.g. .csv type files from Microsoft Excel). 15) The electrical requirements for the system should be: 110-120 volts AC 50/60 Hz. 16) Installation and two days of on site training are required. 17) Must include a warranty guaranteeing one year of parts, labor and travel.

<DESC><p>Description<br />***This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and is current as of FAC 2005-18, DCN 20070531, and AFAC 2007-0531. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is set aside 100% for Small Business (SB). The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 511210 the size standard of which is $23 Million.***
<p>DESCRIPTION: 50 Licenses of the Tactical Validation Authority, which each include: One Server Instantiation &amp; One Software Responder, and one year of maintenance and 24x7 support. <br />The appropriate Justification and Approval is on file with this agency, Section V of the Justification and Approval is as follows: <br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE(APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>Currently according to the DoD PKI office, the only software that is available that can use the DoD provided MiniCRL is the Corestreet product. Corestreet is the manufacturer of the Tactical Validation Authority, the only known product that can consume the MiniCRL data format produced by the DoD PKI PMO's Robust Certificate Validation Service (RCVS) in order to generate Online Certificate Validation Protocol (OCSP) responses.</p>
<p>In order to comply with Communication Tasking Order (CTO), specifically CTO 07-015 that requires all DOD organizations and units to comply with additional requirements to use the NIPRNet that has an effective date of 9 June 2008, the Government requires the Corestreet product. Waiting for another company to develop a similar or compatible product would not be acceptable to comply with the effective date of 9 June 2008. The impact for waiting for another solution, is that personnel at remote locations in Iraq and Afghanistan (and other AOR operating bases that are connected by satellite) often can't open their e-mail if it is digitally signed or might not be able to access secured web servers (due to latency and poor connectivity to the current CRL architecture). On 9 June 2008 the JTF-GNO CTO will take affect (its mandatory for people using the NIPRNet), and the impact will continue to grow, because the down range units cannot control other people outside of the AOR from complying with the rule set that states that you must encrypt and sign certain types of email (in extension, even if they didn't want to comply the people they work with elsewhere will, and it affects them). In addition, units in the CENTCOM AOR continue to consume large amounts of inadequate bandwidth (because it is satellite based and satellite has a much lower bandwidth capability then land lines) with these CRL files.</p>
<p>Through market research, Corestreet's main competitor in this arena (Tumbleweed) does not and will not have a compatible solution for at least six months to a year.</p>
<p><br />For performance/delivery to <br />HQ USCENTCOM CCJ6<br />7115 S. BOUNDARY BLVD<br />MACDILL AFB FL 33621-5101<br />TEL: 813-827-5975</p>
<p><br />PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p>Quotes will be evaluated on price. Award will be made to the lowest price offeror that is determined to be technically acceptable IAW DoD 4500.36R. Bidders shall qoute on all items or none. Please ensure all quotes are complete and accurate, all information is filled out, and required clauses are complied with, otherwise the quotation will be rejected for being non-responsive. The winning contractor will be issued an award corresponding to this solicitation, candidates must include a phone number and/or email address, be registered on the central contractor registration (CCR), ORCA or provide representations and certifications as found in FAR 52.212-3 and 252.212-7000, and not found ineligible for award on the Excluded Partied List System EPLS.

<SUBJECT>Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support the Quality Assurance process for FERC systems
<SOLNBR>FERC08-RFP-80999
<RESPDATE>061808
<CONTACT>Sanjay Sardar, Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO), Email sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov
<DESC>								02 June 2008
Request for Proposal:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Deputy Director of the Chief Information Officer (DCIO)  has a requirement for Independent Test and Evaluation Authority (ITEA) to support quality assurance process for the FERC IT Systems. In order to meet the needs of this requirement, the FERC has determined that the most expeditions method of reviewing and evaluating all offeror capabilities would be through oral presentations.  As such, your are invited to review the technical statement of work located at www.ferc.gov, and specifically, http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp.  You are also instructed to review RFP FERC08-RFP-80148, located at the same URL address, because your ability to perform ITEA for the services procured under this competition may also be required during the life of the awarded ITEA contract.
.
In order to meet federal competitive requirements as well as program schedule requirements, the FERC has determined that a competition utilizing streamlined procedures is the best overall approach to meet these goals.  As previously stated, all potential offerors shall provide their technical approach utilizing an oral presentation.  This process possesses certain rules that the offeror must abide by.  Failure to follow the following rules shall render the presentation non responsive, and therefore, unavailable for award.

-	Technical Solution and Methodology must conform to the requirements of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02,  2008, and located at http://www.ferc.gov/about/offices/oed/oed-proc/FERC08-RFP-80999.asp
-	Only technical information shall be presented
-	No more than 30 slides 
-	The presentation shall not require a presentation lasting more than 60 minutes
-	The offeror shall provide a detailed response for each evaluation factor listed in Section 3. of the Technical Statement of Work, dated June 02, 2008. 
-	Questions are due not later than Tuesday, June 10, 2008, 5:00PM EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this date/time shall cause you to forfeit your opportunity to submit questions.
-	Oral Presentation offers are due not later than Wednesday, June 18, 2008, 5:00PM, EDT, and shall be forwarded by email to sanjay.sardar@ferc.gov.  Failure to meet this deadline shall render your oral presentation nonresponsive and therefore unavailable for award.

Once received, the FERC may require some or all of the offerors to present their oral presentations to a technical evaluation team.  Conversely, the FERC may decide that a competitive range be established without benefit of holding presentations. Under either scenario, you will be notified via email. If oral presentations are to be held, all date/time slots shall be randomly assigned.  It is the intention of this competition to award a single contract to one firm (or a team of firms for which the lead offeror is accountable) for the work to be performed and on the basis of the overall best value to the government.  As such, upon completion of the technical review, the government team shall down select to three (3) or fewer technical proposals, thereby establishing the competitive range.  Those offerors chosen for the competitive range shall be notified via email and a cost proposal shall be requested.  Upon evaluation of the cost proposal, the government shall enter discussions with one or more offerors, if necessary.  Award shall be made to that offeror determined to be the best overall value to the government. The government reserves the right to award to the lowest priced offeror.

<DESC>Environmental Health and Remediation Advisor, USAID/Vietnam 

As an important member of the USAID/Vietnam Mission team, the USPSC Environmental Health Remediation Advisor (EHRA) will serve as the USAID/Vietnam principal and lead official in the inter-agency process to formulate policy, develop program responses, design specific activities and implement the entire range of interventions in public health and environmental remediation in targeted areas of Vietnam as determined by USG and GVN consultation and agreement. In 2007, the U.S. Congress appropriated three (3) million dollars to carry out selected projects.

The EHRA will collaborate and consult closely with other partners in the USG, GVN, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and with private sector consultants, contractors, and technical specialists to implement both the public health and the environmental components of this assistance program.  This collaboration and consultation will include participation on the Joint Assessment Committee (JAC), a joint government-to-government technical body, supported by a 2002 MOU, which has provided the technical forum and framework for efforts to date.  The EHRA works under the supervision of the Director of USAID's Office of Public Health located in Hanoi and is the Missions Health and Environment Professional Expert.  The EHRA and the USAID Representative or his designee play essential roles in the U.S. Mission Agent Orange Working Group.  The EHRA actively participates on the Agent Orange Working Group on updates the group on activities undertaken by USAID to further U.S. policy objectives. The Agent Orange Working Group coordinates overall Mission Agent Orange/dioxin policy, and reports directly to the Ambassador for whom it serves as the principal advisory body with respect to dioxin-related Health and Environmental issues.

As implementation progresses, we expect to strengthen our knowledge of health and environmental issues in the localized hotspots.  This will necessitate modifications to and changed assumptions underpinning implementation efforts.   At the present time, however, we have determined that there are three specific areas of activity critical to the success of this significant undertaking.  Additionally, these defined areas will serve as a guide for the EHRA work effort over the two year term of this contract.

Health Cooperation:  The EHRA will be USAIDs Professional Expert responsible for identifying the principal public health issues. Initially, this will focus on assisting Vietnam's rehabilitation programs serving disabled populations. Emphasis will be on building and strengthening linkages between clinical services and community outreach, screening and identification activities.   The EHRA will coordinate and collaborate with all other contributors, and with the GVN and private sector rehabilitative health professionals, in order to determine specific technical and infrastructural interventions for which the USG may provide assistance.  The incumbent will assure that programs are implemented collaboratively that assistance is in compliance with USG policy and regulations, and that the assistance supports GVN goals and activities in rehabilitative health. Close coordination will be maintained with the Leahy War Victims Fund. The primary geographic area of intervention during the first year of activity will be Danang; however, other areas will be researched and identified for expansion in year two of the project. 

1.	Environmental Remediation: Since July 2001, the United States and Vietnam have increasingly engaged on dioxin-related environmental issues, including numerous engineering studies, joint USG/GVN research projects, scientific training programs and conferences, studies on the methodology of dioxin screening, pilot case studies to evaluate birth defects, technical workshops on soil remediation techniques, and the opening in November 2005 of a USG/GVN- sponsored Joint Dioxin Research Analytical Laboratory in Hanoi.  These interventions involved a number of USG agencies including HHS, EPA, DOD, STATE and USAID. On the GVN side, Committee 33 (and its implementing arm, Office 33) have coordinated GVN Agent Orange/dioxin policies and activities among several ministries, notably,   Vietnam's MOD, MOH, and MFA have been particularly involved. Other important participants include UNDP, UNICEF, the Czech Republic, the Ford Foundation, VVAF, and VNAH.

The EHRA will be required to be familiar with all the work and analysis conducted over the last seven years.  The EHRA will also be expected to schedule and manage additional assessments and environmental studies to build upon the work done to date.  Following this, the EHRA will identify, recommend and implement approved remedial actions to be undertaken in the short to medium term at or adjacent to the Danang Airport, and to develop a long term program for further work at Danang and at other "hot spots" identified by the USG/GVN.  Specific activities to be launched under this program in the short to medium term must be within the $3 million funding level appropriated for this purpose in FY 2007.  These actions will include, but not be limited to, human health and environmental risk assessment, site remediation feasibility studies, field testing of remedial technologies, and site remediation and restoration in conformance with agreed USG/GVN priorities. All activities must be in conformance with the environmental procedures of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 CFR 216). The overriding objective of USG assistance under this component is to determine the nature of the problem(s) and analyze and implement potential solutions. This work will be coordinated with all relevant stakeholders including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment where applicable.  

2.	Public Diplomacy:  The issues surrounding the use of chemicals during the Vietnam War, and its potential impacts on public health and the environment, have sparked intensive debate.  In this context, the incumbent must be able to participate in discussions with persons and entities that hold diverse viewpoints on the issues, to accommodate differing views, and to articulate U.S. policies and procedures to build consensus around selected courses of action.  The incumbent must be adept at engaging all parties in a timely and relevant fashion.

The EHRA will establish and maintain a sound working relationship with GVN counterparts to coordinate activities and overall goals for USG/GVN joint activities and will build a solid foundation for collaboration with U.S., Vietnamese, and other international foundations and interest groups concerned with dioxin related issues. The EHRA must also work closely with populations living and working in or near "hot spots" to reach consensus on proposed interventions.  The EHRA, therefore, must not only possess the requisite technical skills for this job, but also must have the ability to understand various interest groups concerns.   Due to the political sensitivities regarding this issue, the EHRA must be comfortable and effective in a highly visible position, subject to Vietnamese and international scrutiny, and must be prepared to exercise expert judgments, tact and professional discretion.

<DESC>The AMRDEC Software Engineering Directorate (SED) intends to repair 1 Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) radio. These radios were produced in the early 1990s for Army Air Defense systems such as the Patriot Missile System. The Army produced slightly less than 150 terminals at a cost of ~ $1M each.  These radios have been out of production since 1996 and spare parts are very limited.   Recently, a Blower/Power Conditioner failed and is now in need of repair. The SED tried going through the normal Army repair process and discovered that the primary vendor can no longer repair these specific parts. The SED found one vendor that can repair the failed Blower/Power Conditioner by replacing certain parts. The contract will be FFP and sole source to IMC Magnetics Corp. Tempe, AZ (CAGE 04320).

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Question:  The RFQ asked that the skid be 1 inch X 3 inch channel. The closest size available is 1.410 inch X 3 inch. Is this acceptable?<BR>Answer:  Yes.<BR><BR>Question:  After reviewing the specifications we are concerned about the point where the two benches are set side by side creating a pinch point. We are suggesting that we shorten the benches by 1/2 inch to eliminate this pinch point and simulate the spacing between the slats on the benches. Would this be acceptable? <BR>Answer:  Yes.<BR><BR>Question:  Are the benches to be welded to the skid or bolted? <BR>Answer:  Either is acceptable.<BR><BR>Question:  If they are bolted we are suggesting adding gussets to the skid to insure that remain square when the benches are not attached. Would this beacceptable? <BR>Answer:  They will not be un-bolted. They will be removed as a unit fromthe vehicle. A gusset is acceptable.<BR><BR>Question:  To insure that we paint the units correct, we need the military spec. on the paint. <BR>Answer:  Sherwin Williams has the color. Military Tan CARC<BR><BR>Question:  In order to insure we meet your needs we would like more information on the removable brace between the benches in the isle area. The desired height location, number per bench, size?  <BR>Answer:  Two per unit. Using steel or aluminum, construct a brace that will attach to the top of the bench, and serve as a guard rail for personnel and as a structural support during installation and removal from the vehicle. A simple bar, maybe 1 inch diameter with a 'Hitch pin'<BR>type attachment would suffice.<BR>

<p>The following provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (NOV 2007) with addenda as follows:</p>
<p>The vendor shall submit their quote in two (2) sections: Technical Solution and Price. The two sections shall be submitted electronically to Melissa R. Sampson at melissa.r.sampson@noaa.gov. <br /><br />Vendors are required to submit a Technical Solution which will be used to assess the vendor's capability to perform the requirements shown above. The solution shall clearly demonstrate that the vendor has a thorough understanding of the effort called for herein.</p>
<p>Vendors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the solution; as such, solutions must be fully self-sufficient and provide all necessary information for a comprehensive evaluation. Solutions must be sufficient to show how the vendor proposes to accomplish the effort described above.</p>
<p>The following sections of material shall be submitted: <br /><br />Section I - Technical Solution</p>
<p>Technical Solution -shall include all information required for evaluation, excluding any reference to price. The technical section shall be subdivided into the following factors:</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Past Performance</p>
<p>Section II - Price Quote</p>
<p>Price Quote</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach</p>
<p>Vendors should clearly describe their understanding of what is required under this RFQ. The technical approach should address requirements in sufficient detail to determine the Vendor's understanding of the requirements described above. If subcontractors are proposed the technical approach should include a discussion of how they will be utilized so as to explain any possible impacts on performance. The vendor shall submit information in any format the vendor deems relevant for the NOAA to understand and evaluate the following areas:</p>
<p>a. Describe in detail the radar system being offered as to clearly demonstrate that the offered product meets the salient characteristics identified above and that the offered systems meet U.S. Coast Guard Type approval and IMO and IEC requirements.</p>
<p>b. Describe in detail the radar installation inspection and commissioning process that will take place during sea trials.</p>
<p>c. Provide a brochure/product literature of the system being offered.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors shall describe relevant performance on other contracts or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance. List a minimum of three (3) current/previous contracts similar in size, content, and complexity to the effort of this RFQ. The Government is looking for past performance involving successful use of the radar system offered. Information shall include: contract number, name and address of the Government agency or commercial entity, point of contact with current phone number, date of contract award, and period of performance, and initial and current contract value. The requested past performance shall not be older than 5 years. The Government reserves the right to contact any government and private source in addition to those included with the quote.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>The vendor shall provide pricing information in a table format.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212 -2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999) <br />This clause has been tailored to this procurement:</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for Items 0001-0005 including the optional items 0001A -0005A.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single purchase order resulting from this Request for Quote to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the Request for Quote will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to make award without discussion. The determination of greatest value will be made by comparing the differences in the value of the technical factors with the differences in the prices proposed. The technical evaluation factors when combined are significantly more important than price. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve only slightly superior performance capability. The Government will make this assessment through the development of trade-off analyses that involve the assessment of benefits of superior performance capability versus any added costs. As non-price factors approach equality, price as an evaluation factor becomes increasingly more important. The degree of equality between vendor's proposals will be measured by the quantity, significance, and applicability of the superior features offered.<br /><br />The quote shall be evaluated on the criteria listed below:</p>
<p>SECTION I - TECHNICAL SOLUTION</p>
<p>The technical factors, listed in descending order of importance, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>A. TECHNICAL APPROACH</p>
<p>In accordance with 52.212-1 above, quotes will be evaluated on the information contained in the technical approach that demonstrates the degree of understanding by the vendor of the requirements. Of particular importance, regarding evaluation is how the vendor addresses the areas identified in the Instructions to Offerors, paragraph a-c.</p>
<p>B. PAST PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>In accordance with the "Instructions to Offerors" above, quotes will be evaluated on the vendor's demonstrated relevant past performance or affirmative statement that it possesses no relevant or no past performance. Relevant past performance is performance under contracts or efforts (within the past 5 years) that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described in the solicitation. This information will be used to assess the contractor's past performance history.</p>
<p>SECTION II - PRICE QUOTE</p>
<p>While the price is not the most important evaluation factor, its importance in this procurement will not be overlooked. The degree of its importance will increase commensurately with the degree of equality among technical solutions.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)The 827 ACSG Contracting Office Tinker AFB, OK is requesting information on replacement systems for 337 KC135R/T aircraft.  

PURPOSE

The purpose of this RFI is to create a dialogue with industry.  With this notice, the 827 ACSG Contracting Office, Tinker AFB, OK is seeking comments from potential vendors concerning the appropriate strategy for a competitive procurement that supports the objectives of the Block 45 program.  Your comments will help refine procurement strategy.  Block 45 is considering a performance-based procurement with a single contractor solely responsible for all aspects of the modification.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.     

DESCRIPTION

Block 45 is Increment 1 to KC-135 Aircraft Extension Program (AEP) Capabilities Development Document (CDD) Develop and field required capabilities to extend KC-135 as viable weapon system through 2040.  The Block 45 modification consists of four modifications that will
enable mitigation of capability gaps anticipated due to expected airspace restrictions of Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management System (CNS/ATM), resolve mission suitability shortfalls, shortcomings in reliability, maintainability, and supportability.  Block 45 includes (1) Digital Flight Director (DFD) includes replacing Angle of Attack (AOA); (2) Radar Altimeter (RA); (3) Autopilot (AP).

Services to include research and development, technology insertion, system integration, installation, fabrication/prototyping, testing/certification, aircraft ground/flight testing support at Edwards AFB, studies/analyses, logistic support services, training and engineering support services, including re-engineering and reverse engineering, for a range of equipment.  Contractors may use commercial products or existing government inventories to provide the best value solution using processes and practices to reduce cost and schedule and performance risk and to promote future competition for design upgrades and operational support costs. 

Modification Installation effort:  At present, the Government is planning on contractor installation of the modification kits at contractor operated facilities.   A possibility does exist to have the Government install the modification kits using Government personnel at Government owned facilities.  Therefore, the Government is considering a contract structure that allows installation by the Government or contractor as an option to be unilaterally determined by the Government.  The Government is considering variable quantity pricing to allow for program funding changes.  

Businesses with the capability of providing the required services are invited to submit, on a voluntary basis, in writing, sufficient information that demonstrates their ability to fulfill this requirement, information concerning performance-based contract measurement recommendations, contract type, and any other relevant recommendations.

As such, your inputs should not be restrictive or proprietary in any fashion. Although the identification of the contributing companies will not be divulged outside the Government, the Government reserves the right to use in whole or part any industry information received as a result of this RFI as part of a future acquisition strategy.

Maintenance and repair service is presently provided during normal business hours Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. Comparable or better maintenance service is desired. The serial numbers and brands of the freezers are provided in an attachment to this notice. All freezers must be covered by this maintenance coverage-please note that line item #43 of the attachment, the Kenmore freezer with the serial number 703118, is being excessed, so it will no longer be covered by maintenance. Please note that all maintenance service must be quarterly or monthly in arrears, so that any quotations submitted should be forwarded with preference of quarterly or monthly billing. Payment cannot be rendered "up front." No other solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, and may submit a quotation for the service. This procurement is a repost and is no longer set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis of Proposed Competitive 8(a) Procurement of Detention Services at the El Paso Service Processing Center (SPC) located in El Paso, Texas for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) The forthcoming solicitation will be for detention services to include officers, guards and transportation costs at the El Paso Service Processing Center in El Paso, Texas. The procurement will be 8(a) competitive. The solicitation is expected to be posted before April 1, 2008. The period of performance is expected to be July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 for the base year plus four one year options. The mission of the Detention and Removal Operations Program (DRO) is the planning, management, and direction of a broad program relating to the supervision, detention and deportation of aliens who are in the United States illegally. These activities are chiefly concerned with enforcement of departure from the US of aliens who have entered illegally or have become removable after admission. In implementing its mission, DRO is responsible for carrying out all orders for the required departure of aliens handed down in removal proceedings, or prior there to, and arranging for detention of aliens when such becomes necessary. DRO maintains and operates the Deportable Alien Control System (DACS) to process cases located by the Border Patrol, Investigations and Inspections activities. Investigative and Border activities locate aliens who are denied entry or further stay in the US and whose departure must be enforced. The Contractor is required, in units housing ICE detainees, to perform in accordance with the most current editions of the ICE Detention Standards, American Correctional Association (ACA) Standards for Adult Local Detention Facilities (ALDF), and Standards Supplement, Standards for Health Services in Jails, latest edition, National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC). Some ACA standards are augmented by ICE policy and/or procedure. In cases where other standards conflict with DHSIICE Policy or Standards, DHS/ICE Policy and Standards prevail. ICE Inspectors will conduct periodic inspections of the facility to assure compliance of the aforementioned standards. The Contractor shall furnish armed &amp; unarmed detention officer services, including management personnel, supervision, manpower, relief officer, uniforms, equipment, and supplies to provide guard services seven (7) days a week, twenty-four (24) hours per day for the El Paso Service Processing Center. The Contractor is responsible for record keeping services. The El Paso Service Processing Center generally operates at an operational capacity of 800 detainees. The Contractor shall provide a minimum of one Detention Officer of the same gender as the detainees on each post. Detainees are classified as High (Level 3), Medium (Level 2), or Low Risk (Level 1). It is imperative that assigned posts are properly covered at all times. The Contractor shall provide its own fully operational and well-maintained equipment, supplies and forms that pertain to its own business enterprise. Business activities may include replacing equipment and manpower to ensure full service at the ICE location. The Contractor shall provide the transportation for detainees as described in the forthcoming solicitation. In addition, the Contractor shall provide full and complete cooperation for any request or investigation conducted by the Government.</p>

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program (MDA/GMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, Huntsville, Alabama, a new Core Completion Contract for the GMD program that will be comprised of four major work content elements. The four major work content areas that make up the Core Completion Contract include 1) the transfer of activity currently contracted for under HQ0006-01-C-0001 (critical activities necessary to complete the current spiral development), 2) Block 4 hardware and software, 3) European Interceptor Site integration support, and 4) Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities. The GMD Core Completion Contract will be a continuation of past and present BMDS development efforts to complete the current spiral development. Based on current operational schedules, this spiral must be completed by 4th quarter FY 13.
The proposed acquisition is directed to Boeing pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). These four major work content areas cannot be performed by any source other than Boeing without substantial and unacceptable programmatic risk, duplicative cost, and schedule delays. Only Boeing, the incumbent GMD System Prime contractor, has the necessary engineering, manufacturing, and software knowledge and expertise to perform and manage multiple major sub system developments, hardware/software programs and related integration activities without unacceptable delay to program schedules and unnecessary duplication of sunk development costs which cannot be recouped via competition. 

Boeing, as the current prime contractor for the operational capability, continuing spiral development and test of the GMD element of the BMDS, is the only qualified source to perform this completion effort within cost and schedule constraints. Furthermore, Boeing is the only source with the institutional technical knowledge that is critical for managing and integrating the completion of the ongoing development and fielding of the GMD System. Boeing is the only source with the engineering, manufacturing, software and fielding experience and expertise to conduct, manage and integrate the multiple major sub system developments, site design/build activities and related integration efforts without resulting in unacceptable program delays and enormous duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition. Duplication of prior development costs is unaffordable and would not be recoverable through competition for these requirements. There would be additional schedule and costs delays for the government to conduct extensive re-testing/re-validation to ensure the necessary GMD System capabilities, expertise and knowledge have been successfully transferred to any new system prime contractor. It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's critical schedule requirements and not disrupt current system operational capability.  

This proposed sole-source contract action does not preclude the on-going assessment of the future GMD potential competitive requirements which are a part of our current Request for Information (HQ0147-GMD-RFI-1). For the anticipated Core Completion Contract, a Cost Plus Award Fee type contract vehicle is contemplated. The anticipated period of performance to complete the current spiral development in the GMD Core Completion Contract covers 2nd quarter FY09 through 4th quarter FY13. Findings and conclusions from the on-going RFI are to be presented to a senior Integrated Product Team in the 3rd quarter FY 08 timeframe as a prelude to developing any competitive Request for Proposal(s) for competition candidate requirements.  

The proposed contract action is for work content for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties are advised that the GMD program office is currently in spiral development and that adequate system documentation is not currently available. Interested parties who believe they can perform this requirement without substantial duplication of cost or schedule impacts to the Government are invited to submit a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the Government's requirements. The above stated information must be received no later than 15 days after publication of this synopsis, should cite GMD Sole Source Core Completion Contract Acquisition, and shall be emailed to Ms.Cathy Hill at cathy.hill@mda.mil and Ms.Chanda Tallman at chanda.tallman@mda.mil.  

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, as outlined above, which will be considered.  

This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.  

This action is not open to allied participation. See Notes 22 and 26.

<SUBJECT>Clarification Synopsis for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Sole Source Core Completion Contract
<SOLNBR>HQ0147-08-R-0001
<CONTACT>Chanda Tallman, Contract Specialist, Phone 256-450-1444, Email chanda.tallman@mda.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide further clarification relative to the GMD Core Completion Contract (GMD CCC) for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program, published March 21, 2008.  This information is provided in response to comments/questions received in response to the original synopsis and describes the intended CCC requirements in additional detail.

The new GMD CCC consists of four major work content elements as follows: (1) Transitioned Efforts from the Existing Contract; (2) Block 4 Hardware and Software; (3) European Interceptor Site (EIS) Integration Support by GMD; and (4) the Critical Core Weapon System Completion Activities.  The first two elements were part of the overall GMD system requirements authorized for noncompetitive acquisition from Boeing by a previous Justification and Approval (J&A), signed by the Director, MDA, in 2000.  The third element was described as a collateral supporting requirement to the separate EIS contract in the EIS J&A, signed by the MDA Director in 2007. The third element will provide essential support from the GMD system contract to the EIS contract to assure a fully integrated operational interceptor site in Europe.  

Further detail of this work is described below:

(a)  Transfer of Activity Currently Contracted under HQ0006-01-C-0001:  This contract is for an extremely complex, major system that was awarded in 2001.  Since that time significant work added to the contract has made the contract itself too complex to administer effectively.  Affordability issues have also resulted in significant perturbations to technical content and schedule.  As a result there have been numerous contract restructures which have precluded timely completion of the program.  The intent is to complete the residual work remaining on this contract under a new contract structured to allow more favorable terms and conditions and more effective administration.  All work content extending beyond December 31, 2008, will be transferred to the GMD Core Completion Contract.  This work content is currently under contract to Boeing and was approved for noncompetitive acquisition by Lieutenant General Ronald T. Kadish, Director, Missile Defense Agency on February 4, 2000.

(b)  Block 4 Hardware and Software:  The overall Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) is being acquired under a spiral development methodology.  Individual spirals are identified as blocks within a sequential block structure, ultimately leading to completion of the BMDS.  This element includes Block 4 hardware, software, and related system engineering and integration activities.  Currently Block 4 represents the last major GMD system development spiral.  This block is intended to provide the necessary hardware and software to enable European Capability.  Block 4 includes additional, improved versions of assets previously procured under the current GMD system contract with Boeing.  Design and development of Block 4 improvements are being performed under the current GMD System prime contract with Boeing.  The intent will be to procure enough hardware/software and related system engineering and integration to support and deliver ten (10) additional Ground Based Interceptors (extends through FY13), silos and related flight and ground test assets.  Hardware/software for FY09 includes Launch Site Components (LSC) and Command Launch Equipment (CLE) hardware and related software, launch equipment and related Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), Re-locatable In-Flight Interceptor Communications System (IFICS) Data Terminal and tactical/non-tactical communications capability (extends through FY10).  This additional hardware/software will complete the currently-planned GMD production with a total of 54 operational interceptors at all sites. It is noted that up to 100 interceptors were authorized by the J&A of January 2000.  

(c)  European Interceptor Site:  This element includes GMD system development and site activation engineering and integration activities in support of the European Interceptor Site requirement.  This element will provide for the integration of all Government furnished equipment (GFE) and contractor furnished equipment (CFE).  It includes design, development, and installation of the hardware and software to support the European Missile complex; ensure facility-GBI launch equipment and communication component interfaces are coordinated; integration of tactical and non-tactical facilities and related infrastructure; and procurement and integration of communication links.  A J&A for the design, development and construction of the EIS was approved for other than full and open competition by Lieutenant General Henry A. Obering on January 12, 2007, and a separate EIS contract was awarded to Boeing in April 07.  The GMD system development, engineering and integration support covered by this element was specifically identified as an essential collateral element to the separate EIS contract authorized by that J&A.  The EIS contract and the GMD contract are separate, but inter-related; support is required from the GMD System contract to the EIS contract for effective execution and integration of the overall EIS effort.  

Additional GMD specific systems engineering and integration support and program synchronization will be provided by Boeing to other European Missile Complex Contracts (i.e. European Midcourse Radar acquisition, as well as the Command and Control Battle Management and Communications (C2BMC) acquisition) as necessary to assure compatibility between separate European facilities/systems.

(d)  Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities:  This effort provides for Critical Core GMD Weapon System Completion Activities. This consists of work specifically planned or contemplated for inclusion on the current contract if it were continued.  It is essential to commence this work by second quarter FY09 in order to meet the required operational capability for this work content.  This remaining Core GMD Completion work content will be comprised of critical acquisition activities necessary to complete GMD system spiral development including ongoing integrated acquisition logistics development activities and related element readiness testing.  It will also include on-going agency requirements such as sustainment, operations, and support to Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) systems integration and testing until completion and award of competitive breakout acquisitions which result from the ongoing GMD RFI Process.  Specific content includes:

(1)  Block 3 Core Development: Completes Near Term Discrimination, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) upgrades/improvements, Divert & Attitude Control System (DACS) improvements, and completes close out of software discrepancy reports.

(2)  GMD Element Testing: Continues with the planning, execution, and analysis of GMD element readiness tests which include ground tests, simulations, and other appropriate activities against the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense segment of the BMDS as part of the walk-up to BMDS integration and flight tests.  The element readiness tests will be against Block 4 or earlier configurations.

(3)  GBI Refurbishment: Continue to procure and install refurbishment kits through FY09.  Refurbishment after FY09 is a competition candidate activity and is to be addressed in the ongoing GMD RFI process. 

(4)  Support to BMDS System Testing: Continue GMD-related flight and ground test activities for the broader BMDS until establishment and approval of the BMDS Acquisition Strategy for these test events is approved and implemented. 

(5)  BMDS Development:  Development of the following functions: Track Correlation, System Discrimination, Sensor Registration, Engagement Coordination, Hit/Kill Assessment: for the C2 portion of the service oriented architecture is not included in the Core Completion Contract and will be implemented as a part of the broader BMDS Acquisition Strategy.  The integration of these common functions into the GMD element is included in the scope of this J&A.  This also includes minimal GMD-specific development and integration support  to other BMDS development efforts to include Command & Control Battle Management & Communications/Global Engagement Manager (C2BMC/GEM), Multiple Kill Vehicle (MKV), and Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI); future upgrades for Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) and Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR); Joint GM/Kinetic Interceptor (KI) Booster Avionics Commonality, Command & Control Battle Management & Communications/GMD Fire Control (C2BMC/GFC) System Track, Thermal Initiated Venting System (TIVS), Ground Systems Obsolescence, and BMDS future discrimination activities through FY09.  BMDS Development, with the exception of Thermal Initiated Venting System (TIVS), after FY09 is a competition candidate activity and is to be addressed in the ongoing GMD RFI process. 

(6)  Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) / Fort Greely Alaska (FGA) Enhancements: Includes GMD-specific facility upgrades and re-designs through FY09.  Enhancements after FY09 are a competition candidate activity and are to be addressed in the ongoing GMD RFI process. 

(7)  Modeling and Simulation (M&S) development:  Future GMD-specific test lab upgrades and M&S development through FY09.  M&S development after FY09 is a competition candidate activity and is to be addressed in the ongoing GMD RFI process.  In addition, GMD test lab sustainment and maintenance through FY09.  It is contemplated that these will be separate line items due to differences in funding sources.  

(8)  GMD Weapon System O&S:  This includes analysis leading up to a performance based logistics (PBL) concept for all GMD weapon system components.  It is anticipated that the actual PBL construct will be fully implemented in CY10 and beyond.  Work beyond CY09 is a candidate for competition.  O&S/PBL after CY09 is a competition candidate activity and is to be addressed in the ongoing GMD RFI process. 

(9)  This element may include potential additional follow-on requirements for GMD specific support in the areas of development, integration, testing, operations and sustainment.  The GMD RFI analysis is ongoing.  If the RFI process confirms any of the RFI areas are not practicable for competition, this J&A will be amended and a modification will be initiated against the contract(s) vehicle resulting from this J&A.

From August 2007 to January 2008, the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program performed a comprehensive acquisition risk analysis that addressed GMD work content planned for execution from January 2009 to September 2013.  The risk analysis included participation by the Chief Engineer, as well as, Program Managers from Ground Systems (GS), Ground Based Interceptor (GBI), Test and Evaluation, Sensors, and Operations and Sustainment (O&S) Directorates.  The analysis assessed impact to GMD cost, schedule and performance and correlated a risks probability of occurrence to a system maturity criterion, data availability metrics and the criticality of Boeings role in future efforts.  Seven critical competition risk areas were identified for both the GMD Continuing Development and Operations and Sustainment programs.

(a)  Continuing Development:

(1)  Test laboratories and Embedded Test (ET) Availability

(2)  Interceptor Integration Facility Availability

(3)  GDIL Availability

(4)  Interoperability, delivery, and upgrade of operational hardware and software

(5)  Integration of incomplete capabilities into existing system

(6)  Boeing technical/corporate knowledge base

(7)  CONUS to EIS integration


(b)  Operations and Sustainment:

(1)  No configuration baseline

(2)  Future work/maintenance and repair relies on incomplete Logistics Data

(3)  Obsolete System Architecture

(4)  Training

(5)  Multiple Integrators and OEMs

(6)  Loss of investment (Trained Manpower and Infrastructure)

(7)  Facility infrastructure support based on incomplete TDP

The Risk Analysis concluded that the Agency does not have the necessary technical data packages and associated data rights to adequately support competitive acquisition of the requirements under the GMD CCC J&A.  Award to a source(s) other than Boeing would result in unacceptable schedule delays for any other source(s) to establish the necessary GMD System knowledge, expertise, and capabilities to successfully perform the requirements under the GMD CCC.  Duplicative costs to the government would accompany the learning curve and schedule delays associated with award of these requirements to a source(s) other than Boeing. Further, GMD schedule delays would significantly impact other elements of the integrated BMDS.  Significant cost and schedule delays would be incurred against other BMDS contracts due to delays in BMDS-level testing resulting from GMD schedule delays.  

The GMD Contracting Officer issued a Request for Information (RFI) to industry via the FedBizOpps on November 19, 2007.  Modification 01 to the RFI was posted on November 20, 2007.  The RFI identified the following GMD critical risk areas for government assessment: 

(1)  System Test Capability

(2)  Simulated Combat Environment Capability

(3)  Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) Integration Facility Capability

(4)  GBI Development and Integration Lab Capability

(5)  External Interface Capability

(6)  Sustainment and Upgrade of CONUS/OCONUS Operational HW/SW

(7)  Integration of Capability into the GMD System

(8)  Data Requirements

(9) Any Additional Considerations (teaming arrangements)

(10)  Total System Integration (Late Addition Provided to All Current Respondents to Original RFI)

Each potential source submitted a white paper detailing its approach to the GMD RFI.  Industry briefings were held from January 16 through January 31, 2008.  Follow-up questions were then sent to individual contractors to enable the government to better understand certain aspects of their presentations.  Industry inputs are being utilized to develop the Governments risk assessment for the above critical acquisition risk areas and potential impacts against competition for the areas identified above.  The white papers and associated briefs are being assessed by a panel of subject matter experts to determine if the proposed mitigation approaches are technically feasible and executable.  Findings and conclusions are to be presented to a Senior Integrated Product Team in May 2008 as a prelude to developing a competitive Request for Proposal(s) for the competition candidate requirements.

The Missile Defense Agency Ground-Based Midcourse Defense Program (MDA/GMD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company, Huntsville, Alabama, a new Core Completion Contract for the GMD program that will be comprised of four major work content elements.

<DESC>1. OBJECTIVE & SCOPE

1.1 INTRODUCTION
As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of a centralized geocoding platform (service and/or system) which will best serve the broad geocoding needs of the Department and its component agencies. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit innovative and efficient geocoding methodologies that provide the GMO with insight into the current state of the art both from a data content and system perspective. The information collected will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for any enterprise geocoding solution the Department may wish to develop in the future.  

1.2 BACKGROUND
The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize DHSs return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO has developed a geospatial solutions architecture, the Geospatial Information Infrastructure (GII), which is the technology target for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized geocoding solution that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Departments enforcement, preparedness, response, recovery mission areas.    

1.3 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS
At present there are approximately 15 known geocoding engines servicing various system requirements within DHS. In this current environment, each geocoding engine and their associated reference layers are maintained by a variety of technology, data, staff and other ongoing operations and maintenance infrastructure. Additionally the amount and availability of geocoding functionality from these various geocoding services is largely inaccessible to the broader end users. These current disparate configurations also hinder the ability for remote staff to access geocoding services in a manner that is timely and efficient. 

1.4 FUTURE STATE OF OPERATIONS
The future geocoding environment for DHS will be consolidated to a single solution that supports Department-wide geocoding operations. This fully integrated solution, will help to minimize overall levels of IT investment, enhance overall service delivery, and will be implemented in one of DHSs two data warehouses. Although this more centralized environment will likely exist within an infrastructure controlled and managed by the government, it should also be able to leverage distributed services for certain aspects of desired functionality and/or take advantage of a vendor supplied service delivery that might be cost prohibitive for the government to implement or would offer the desired levels of dynamic failover to a redundant service. Centralizing DHSs geocoding requirements also meets the intent of DHS Management Objective 4030, and the Departments Investment Portfolio Management Program.  

This future geocoding solution will support DHS business processes in the areas of:

Ad hoc street address matching to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Batch processing of street addresses to include validation, standardization, and geocoding,

Address validation, certification, correction, and other interpolative capabilities

Methods of determining and matching the location of landmarks, cities, towns, and other commonly-used geographic references (i.e. Gazetteer level functionality)

Proximal intelligence or supplemental detail on environs of geocoded results beyond simple latitude and longitude returns (i.e. demographics, political boundaries, census designation, Congressional Districts etc)

Ability to load and manage custom taxonomies, data dictionaries and GIS datasets.

Reverse geocoding capabilities to translate incoming coordinate data and dimensionalize that geo-location data to a local street address, nearest populated place etc... 

While serving the businesses processes described above are of immediate interest to the Department and the majority of its mission owners and operators, it is conceivable that a future state of operations may also optionally contain a capability to search text documents using various geographic keywords and display that information geographically on a map interface.   

This future geocoding environment will be implemented in such a way as to support the broadest end users possible, the following DHS components are specifically in scope for this desired implementation given known requirements and existing mission needs:

Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE)
Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
U.S. Secret Service (USSS)
National Operations Center (NOC)
U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)

Anticipated volume/usage metrics:

The estimated monthly volume of ad hoc geocoding requests. .   500,000
The estimated monthly volume of batch geocoding requests... 1,000,000
The estimated monthly volume of unstructured (gazetteer) requests. 20,000,000	

Characteristics of the future solution may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:

Systems provisioned via service oriented architectures/automation interfaces,
Systems hosted and maintained by solution provider outside DHS firewalls,
Systems hosted and maintained by DHS within its firewalls,
Systems that provide graphical user interfaces

viii.  DHS Use Case Scenarios
In addition to describing the system/architectural elements of their solution(s), respondents should also outline how end users would specifically interact with their proposed solution(s) in the following use case scenarios:

 Batch Geocoding Use Case:
A program analyst has recently received a comma delimited export file from an existing DHS mission critical application. This file contains several hundred thousand to several million addresses which needs to be geocoded in a batch process to support follow on analysis. Some of these records share a single street address (i.e. commercial office or high rise apartment building). Any address which is not directly matched to a particular reference data set should be re-geocoded using multiple reference data sources to reconcile address mismatches. Assuming this analyst has access to the DHS intranet as well as the outside internet, please describe how this end user would interact with the proposed solution to achieve a geocoding match rate above 85% 

 Gazetteer Level Functionality: 
A variety of DHS mission domains require access to a rapid map display functionality based on simple keyword searches for purposes of geolocation and to better orient themselves to a particular area of interest quickly. Typical keyword searches used might include:

 Exact/Partial Street Address
 City/Neighborhood/County Name
 Landmark Alias (i.e Empire State Building, Golden Gate Bridge etc)

For example, a good Samaritan observes a signal flare from the 3rd floor of his beach front hotel and telephones in to a local US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) operations center. During the call the SAR controller must rapidly translate that observer and observed information to a corresponding Latitude/Longitude, in order to best vector USCG assets to aid those in distress. Please describe how the proposed geocoding solution(s) might support this potential call center application and provide a flexible gazetteer level functionality to both DHS end users with and without outside internet connectivity.

 Ad-hoc Interactive Geocoding from a GIS Enabled Desktop Workstation
Describe how the proposed solution(s) could support a geospatial analyst using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software application to support geocoding in an ad hoc or interactive way. Respondents should describe in detail how the proposed solution leverages both existing COTS GIS functionality and any proposed plug-ins, additional applications, and/or toolbar(s) to support accurate and efficient geocoding. Respondents may assume the geospatial analyst has access to both the DHS intranet and the wider internet.

 Geo-Entity Extraction from a Structured/Unstructured Text
Please describe how the proposed solution(s) might support a geographic keyword search across a variety of text based documents, messages, and/or reports and then display the results in a geographic context on a map display to better inform analysis and/or decision making.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) issued a delivery order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-07-G-0008 to the Bell-Boeing Joint Program Office, 401 Tiltrotor Drive, Amarillo, TX  79111 on a sole-source basis for the implementation of Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) for the Procurement of EMI Hardened Proximity Sensors for the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft.  The ECP implemented the configuration change into seventeen (17) operational aircraft to assess system redesign in an operational environment.  This effort includes procurement and installation of 17 hardware kits at CONUS site, and delivery of installation service instruction.
