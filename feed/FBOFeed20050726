PLEASE REGISTER AS A SOURCE (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil) TO BE NOTIFIED OF IFB, AMENDMENTS, CLARIFICATIONS, ETC.  Offerors (including those registered as a source) ARE RESPONSIBLE TO CHECK THE  PIXS WEBSITE FOR CURRENT INFORMATION.    This project consists of replacing 6 actuators for raw water valves ranging from 16" diameter to 72" diameter.  These valves are located in valve pits throughout the Base and some are controlled remotely from a central location, while some are locally controlled at the valve pit.  Additionally, this effort will provide and install sump pumps and high water level alarms in 10 valve pits.  Some of the alarms will be connected to the central system, and provide indication on the control system graphics panel, while others will only require a local high water level alarm.   An optional part of this contract will be to replace the actuator for an existing 12" diameter valve, and replace 3 manually operated water valves with new valves and actuators (20" diameter, 24" diameter, and 36" diameter).   Included in this option will  be sump pumps and local high water level alarms for 3 additional valve pits. Electrical work will include providing and installing electrical conduit, wiring and essential accessories as required for lighting, actuators, and sump pumps.  This work will require entry into confined spaces and access to valves located in water filled valve pits in some cases.  Coordination with test schedules and minimization of water outages will be required.

Project No. 4CA0048

Summary Requirement:
The General Services Administration desires to lease approximately 12,535 rentable square feet of office space, and must be located on the second floor or higher.  Space on the first floor will only be considered by the FBI when no other space is available, or if deemed appropriate by the FBI.  The rentable square foot number must yield a minimum of 10,900 to a maximum of 11,445 ANSI/BOMA Office Area for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to house personnel, furnishings, and equipment, together with fourteen (14) secured, on-site parking spaces.

Building Requirement:
The General Services Administration will use the Quality Solicitation for Offers to satisfy this requirement in an office building in a section of the city that is professional and prestigious in appearance, well maintained, of modern design, and of sound and substantial construction.  The requested space must be fully serviced, and in a building capable of being altered to meet the Government’s needs and security requirements as well as requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

The vehicle barrier must be within the property line and be accomplished by any or all of the following methods:  natural, mechanical, and/or fixed means.  However, Government parking can be within the 50-100-foot distance if the Offeror can demonstrate that the public cannot enter into this secured area.

An award of contract will not be made for a property located within a base flood plain or wetland unless the Government has determined it to be the only practicable alternative.

Location / Delineated Area:
The building offered must be located within the City of San Diego, California, within the following boundaries:

North:  Rancho Bernardo Road
East:  Pomerado Road south from Rancho Bernardo Road to Interstate 15.  From Interstate 15 to Aero Drive, then a 1.5 mile corridor east to Interstate 15

Lease term:
The term is for five (5) years firm.  

Occupancy Date:
Occupancy must be within 270 days after receipt of the GSA approved layout.

Expressions of interest should include the following:
	1.	Building/subdivision/lot name and address.  
	2.		Rentable square feet, and rate per rentable square foot.  Indicate the size of the lot if offering a build to suit.
3.	Confirm BOMA Method of Measurement, usable yield for available space by floor and building common area factor.

NSN:  5410-01-512-3416EJ, P/N 9434477-50 Noun:  Dome Shelter 5K

Dome Shelter Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs)
				Basic		Option I	Option II	Option III
FY05		FY06		FY07		FY08
5410-01-494-5130EJ		9		2		1		1

5410-01-512-3416EJ, 		2		1		1		1

General Characteristics:  The Dome Shelters are a group of shelters used for a variety of applications including warehousing and as an aircraft hanger.  The shelters do not require a foundation and can be erected on both a smooth natural site relatively free of surface rock or on a pre-existing concrete pad.  The domes consist of an aluminum arched frame, tensioned weatherproof fabric, and an electrical system.  The shelters can be erected and disassembled from ground level.  All tools necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package.  The various configurations have different lengths, door types, end walls, and electrical systems.

The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-363-0090EJ) has two Big Mouth Doors that span the shelter width.  It is approximately 60 feet by 60 feet yielding a square footage on the order of 4000 square feet.  The 8K Dome Shelter (5410-01-494-5130EJ) also has two Big Mouth Doors, but has twice as many body panels, approximately doubling the length of the shelter.  The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-455-2004EJ) with gabled (flat) end wall is similar to the 4K Dome Shelter, but a flat end all replaces one of the Big Mouth Doors.

The Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-500-7537EJ) is not a stand alone item.  It contains the components to create a Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-512-3416EJ) that is approximately 5000 square feet, from an existing 4K.  The dome extension contains additional aluminum frame, replacement fabric for the entire shelter, a replacement lighting system, and additional component, including electrical.

Dome Shelters and the Dome Extension Assembly each will require a First Article.  Condition(s) for Waiver of First Article Approval:  Offerors currently in production of the same or similar article for an Air Force contract and who have received First Article approval under the existing contract or offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Air Force, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Air Force or provided not more than 60 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.

Electronic procedures will be posted for this solicitation on or around 15 Apr 05 and will be posted under RFP FA8518-05-R-75816 at http://www.fedbizops.gov/.  Government Data/Drawings will be available for these items and will be posted with the solicitation.

HU25 FULL FACE QUICK DONNING OXYGEN MASK PART NUMBER (P/N) MF10-03-02 REPAIR/OVERHAUL
STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
22 JUNE 05

1.	BACKGROUND
The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Masks, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, were installed in these aircraft in 1991 and are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking also provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, and item location.  

2.	OBJECTIVE
2.1	The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain services of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or an FAA authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.  Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications In Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25 935030.0 dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition and will be replaced as necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6) years. 

The Coast Guard anticipates two levels of repair.  First, a “return to service” is considered as test/inspect/repair as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy., Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.) if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to service requirements (component time continues). Secondly, an overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary. An overhaul zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO). 

The Contractor shall install Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to Hose Assembly P/N DTS series for both repair and overhaul.  

The Contractor shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  Offerors may propose additional levels of service.

The Contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul oxygen masks.
The Contractor responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that all OEM service bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon completion of work.

THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE APPLICABLE:

3.1	OEM Component Maintenance manual: 
CMM 35-13-61, REV 2, dated 01/31/2003

3.2	CG Technical Orders:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

FAR Clauses:  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.  Instead, a solicit! ation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record.  Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help y! ou gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-1 Buy American Act-Supplies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.o.B.

<DESC>JOEF is one of the Battle Management projects within the Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense Program.  JOEF is a modeling and simulation tool required to determine the effects and assess the impact and risks associated with CBRN hazards, as well as Toxic Industrial Materials (TIM), on military operations and personnel.  This system requirement supports a non-real time, advance planning and analysis capability, as well as a near real time dynamic staff action support tool capability.  JOEF is required to accurately depict the CBRN warfare environment including sensor/system deployment and the effects on personnel, equipment, and operations.  JOEF is a CBRND tool to meet the  Capability Development Document (CDD) requirements for fixed sites, mobile forces, and medical and automation of Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and provide for Consequence Management (CM). JOEF will provide a computer-based federated software system capable of providing deliberate and crisis planning support for the development of CBRND operational plans and near real time decision aids in a combat environment. The federated capability approach will allow JOEF tobe tailored to specific user needs.  JOEF will provide the Joint Services with the capability to prioritize CBRND development efforts and focus existing and future efforts towards satisfying CBRND Joint Future Operational Capabilities (JFOCs).  JOEF will provide support tools and software systems that will assist operational planners in determining the operational effectiveness of proposed systems; determining requirements (e.g., detection levels, protection levels, etc.); evaluating technology and concepts; designing forces; developing TTPs; training; and planning/preparing for military operations; optimizing logistics and medical resources. The overall JOEF requirement will be developed in the following three increments: Increment "I" will be hosted on Common Operating Environment (COE) Command, Control, Computers, Communications, and Intelligence (C4I) hosts systems and Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC), in a networked environment.  It will support the deliberate planning for operational and strategic users, and crisis planning for operational users.  This BAA addresses JOEF Increment I only. Increment "II" will be hosted on C4I systems as in Increment I and also operate in stand-alone mode.  It will add deliberate planning for tactical users, and crisis planning for the strategic and tactical users.  The second increment extends the capabilities to include military capabilities in support of incident management and consequence management to military users at all three command levels. Increment "III" includes all the capabilities in Increments I and II and will extend the consequence management and incident response management capabilities to include civilian commands. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT FOR JOEF OPERATIONAL PROTOTYPE - INCREMENT I, PLEASE SEE ATTACHMENT.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC PC) intends to award a sole source purchase order to UGS Corporation of Plano, Texas for an anthropometrical and ergonomic modeling and simulation design tool called JACK.  This software enables engineers to position biomechanically accurate digital humans in virtual environments, assign them tasks and analyze their performance.  JACK (and Jill) digital humans can tell engineers what they can see and reach, how comfortable they are, when and why they’re getting hurt, when they’re getting tired and other important ergonomics information.  The JACK M&S tool allows the engineer to add a human ergonomic and anthropometrical model to the virtual (CAD) Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) environment, thus providing the opportunity for a comprehensive analysis of the human factors of the design before any physical prototypes are built.  JACK will be used on a variety of Naval programs, but primarily on the Littoral Combat Ship (L! CS) program.  NSWC PC uses Solid Edge base-wide as the modeling software for mechanical engineers to create virtual mechanical designs.  JACK and Solid Edge are made by UGS and are designed to work specifically with each other.  Extensive LCS modeling has been created in Solid Edge. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  JACK is made to work specifically with Solid Edge CAD toolset; JACK and Solid Edge are both made by UGS.  Since the mechanical engineers are using Solid Edge to create the virtual LCS environment, JACK is the only software module that ensures 100% compatibility.  JACK was selected by Micro Analysis and Design in an SBIR for Scriptable Human Figures in an Open Environment Architect.  The SBIR was created to allow a CAD software, an anthropometrical software (JACK) and a human performance software (MicroSaint) to talk with each other and interact in a virtual environment.  The SBIR created “script translations”!  specifically for the 3 software interfaces, including JACK.  Therefore, using JACK in the Open Environment Architect would eliminate the cost of “script translations” since they were already done for this particular anthropometrical software. JACK offers the features that are desired for a Human-Centered Design Analysis in the virtual LCS environment.  The anticipated award date will be on or about August 13, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 541511 applies. SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees. FSC is 9999.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Massachusetts Institutes of Technology (MIT) Department of Economics and Center for Energy and Environmental Policy for experts who have extensive experience in energy and environmental economics. The services to be acquired for a contract to fund a multi-year research program to develop an analytical framework and modeling capability to evaluate the potential for integrating weather forecast date into air quality regulation in order to reduce economic cost and improve environmental effectiveness.  The problem to be evaluated in the initial step is ozone non-attainment and the control of NOx precursor emissions in the Northeastern United States.  Sole source determination is based on the need that this contract builds on a feasibility study that examined whether operating reserve capacity within the electrical system provides enough potential quick-response flexibility in dispatch for sufficient reduction in NOx emissions even during peak demand hours. The objective of this research is to address two policy concerns. The first is to explore in detail the potential for redispatching electric power generators by NOx emissions when realistic transmission and operational constraints are accounted for.  The second task is to explore the relationship between predictability of ozone exceedences and the time horizon of the forecast.  This will be a joint NOAA/EPA project.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jointly been developing a national forecast capability.  This system was tested for the northeastern U.S. during the ozone season of 2004.  This requirement is being advertised under Other Than Full and Open Competition by the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, citing U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1),Only One Responsible Source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541620, and the size standard is $6.0M. The period of performance will be for a base period of twelve months and two twelve month option periods. This is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation will be published.  However, any interested party may submit written evidence of their interest and bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement to cheryl.coxen@noaa.gov no later than the response date for this posting.  Supporting evidence must be furnished with a statement in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements noted above.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the agency.  SEE NOTE 22.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with 2B Technologies, P.O. Box 288, Golden, CO  80402-0288 for five (5) ozone monitors.  NOAA requires a small, lightweight (less than 7 kg) instrument where the pilot must be able to load the instrument package on the aircraft single-handedly and the package must fit into a 45cm x 35cm x 17cm (length x width x height) space.
The analyzer is to be used on small aircraft and must be able to operate autonomously.  The analyzer will be added to an existing aircraft network of 2B Technologies ozone analyzers that all must have the same configuration and specifications to maintain data integrity across all network sites. The instrument must be capable of recording the data in ASCII format using RS-232 output as well as inputs from auxiliary sensors including a GPS unit, temperature and humidity probes.  The instrument must operate on a rechargeable battery.  A removable memory device (flash card) that contains the recorded data must be a part of the analyzer so that the data can be readily sent back to NOAA for analysis. The instrument must operate using the standard technique of absorption of ultraviolet light with dual cell design to provide 1 ppb precision for 1 minute data resolution.  No liquid chemicals or bottle gases can be part of the instrument.

<CONTACT>MATTHEW J. GROWNEY, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2029, E-Mail: growney.matthew@epa.gov
<DESC>Under authority granted in FAR 13.501, the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to seek a quotation on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS from Quantum Analytics to provide a Markes Autosampler and Desorber coupled to Agilent GC-MS system. The primary use of this instrumentation will be to fulfill Agency requirements to assess ambient carcinogens as trapped on fine particulate filters, specifically particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and similar particle bound organic species.  The requested system is a complex hybrid of state-of ?the-art instrumentation.  The Agency has developed methodology for the Agilent GC-MS system and requires such a system for compatibility with existing published methods.  The Markes sample processor is uniquely developed to incorporate highly inert internal flow paths required for processing semi-volatile organic compounds such as PAHs.  The specific requirements are listed below: ?	It is required that the instrumentation is seamlessly coupled from sample processing through analytical finish and that a single vendor is responsible for installation, training and demonstration. ?	It is required that the sample format be flexible to allow for different adsorbent materials and that once the sample format is prepared that there is no further manipulation required, either by personnel or by machinery, with respect to removal of seals, caps, etc. during the analytical process to avoid compromising sample integrity. ?	It is required that the system can be automatically set to analyze a large number of samples automatically (~100) and that sample integrity is maintained over the period of time required to analyze all of the samples. ?	It is required that the system be capable of fulfilling quality assurance functions such as re-analysis of any given sample automatically from the same sample tube, and for testing recovery efficiency and sample load carry-over. ?	It is required that the system can measure sub-nanogram quantities of semi-volatile compounds with molecular mass up to 300 amu. Quantum Analytics, is the only known vendor capable of providing this equipment, interfacing multiple systems from original equipment manufacturers, and performing installation and training.   The Quantum Analytics equipment has a series of unique technical features that enable this success.  These include, but are not limited to, a unique sealing mechanism for the sample devices that does not require physical removal of the caps, (a proprietary design called DiffLoktm ) and a unique feature for method validation for quantitative repeat analyses (a proprietary design called SecureTDtm ).    THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by August 10, 2005 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the July 2005 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-04.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519120 with a small business size standard of $6.0 million.  The mission of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is to collect, preserve and disseminate biomedical information.  In support of this mission the Library has assembled one of the largest collections of biomedical literature in the world and continues to collect in some forty biomedical areas and to a lesser degree in related areas.  In total the Library’s collections contain approximately 7.5 million print and non-print items.  The Library’s print collections are housed in the General Collection, the History of Medicine Division (HMD), and the Main and HMD Reading Rooms.  NLM’s serial collection contains approximately 92,000 serial titles (some with more than one holdings location).  Of that number 13,524 are titles that have been indexed by NLM (noted hereafter as IM titles).  Of the total number of IM titles, 4,850 titles currently are being indexed.  The baseline inventory will be an item by item review of bound and unbound serial items that number approximately 1,280,000 bound serial volumes and 8,000-11,000 unbound serial issues.  The work to be accomplished will consist of comparing physical volumes at the shelf with the online records, creating, correcting or deleting item records, adding barcodes and security labels, creating or correcting existing holdings records, and identifying and resolving or referring problems as instructed by NLM.  The serial titles to be inventoried are housed in the General Collection and HMD collections on the B1, B2 and B3 floor levels.  With the exception of titles in HMD and General Collection oversized volumes, the contractor staff shall complete the inventory of each title regardless of the shelving location(s), making sure that every title in the General Collection shelved on the B1 and B3 floor level is treated as a unit.  Serials shelved in a special area on B3 designated for oversized items (GENCOLLOV3) and HMD titles will be batched and inventoried separately by the contractor.  The inventory of each title shall begin with the first item on the shelf for the title through the last bound volume.  The unbound journal issues for open titles that were published beyond the last bound volume on the shelf will not be included in the inventory, although missing and lost item records shall be verified or corrected.  The following phases of the inventory are in priority order and shall be done in that order by the contractor:

Phase One:  	All W1, non-W1, and classed serials that have been indexed by NLM (IM titles), excluding indexed analyzed titles.  (Estimated 13,525 titles. in 13,720 shelving locations)
Phase Two:  	Non-Indexed W1 serials (Estimated 51,029 in 51,992 shelving locations)
Phase Three:  	Non-Indexed classed collection and W2 serials (Estimated 500 titles. in 503 shelving locations)
      	Phase Four:  	Analyzed titles   (Estimated 26,960 titles)

Most of the serial titles in HMD and many in the General Collection were published in foreign languages.  The contractor shall refer to Manual of European Languages for Librarians to decipher titles and volume information whenever necessary.  A copy of this reference tool will be provided to the contractor by the Project Officer along with other reference materials.  The NLM has scheduled a site visit to review the performance site.  The site visit is on Tuesday August 15, 2005 from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>The NIH Clinical Center plans to procure from Thomas Lewis, 11801 Gainsborogugh Rd. Potomac MD 20854 for MIS/CRIS Consultation. The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform this requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the Clinical Center to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE TAKEN REGARDING THIS SOLICITAION. ALL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED BY C.O.B. AUGUST 8, 2005 EST. PLEASE SUBMIT PROPOSALS VIA EMAIL TO AMCGEE@CC.NIH.GOV 

The Clinical Center is a clinical research hospital providing all medical services for patients participating in human research protocols of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The Clinical Center provides patient facilities and services for clinical investigations by the NIH Institutes, research in related areas and supervises residency and other training programs. The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for processes and systems that directly affect users in the care delivery and research settings.  Work focuses on the analysis and evaluation of clinical research informatics needs and requirements, the development of design options that support the work processes of clinical research, and the implementation and management of responsive IT solutions.  

The purpose of this contract is to continue the services of a contract consultant to complete the MIS migration for the Clinical Data Warehouse for Clinical Research Information System (CRIS).   The project has been ongoing for approximately three years.  The migration is 90% complete.  This contract is a time and materials contract that is time limited and being executed so that the project can start before or on August 28, 2005 and completed by November 1, 2005.   The contractor’s involvement in the project and his inherent knowledge of the relevant data structures makes him uniquely able to assist in this task.  This is considered a sole source statement of work. 

The contractor, working closely with the Clinical Data Warehousing team will perform the following task: Support requests for data extractions – the current tools used for extracting data from both Medical Information System (MIS) and the Clinical Data Repository (CDR) are arcane and specialized. Ad hoc queries require significant time and effort to design and execute.

The contractor will be required to assist the Clinical Data Warehouse team as follows; design database tables, eliminate duplicates, and populate the tables on the development and production servers; process all appointment data, demographics, and vitals; process all blood bank and medication administration (hereafter referred to as admin); process all X-ray and orders; process all IV admin and “nursing data” (remaining A data, nursing notes, etc.); Recover corrupted purge data on a periodic basis as time permits over the four iterations of development.

The contractor will meet initially with the Technical Deputy CIO to establish a timeline for completion of the proposed tasks.

The contractor will provide written progress reports on a monthly basis regarding the status of tasks.

The government will provide the contractor with the necessary facilities to support task completion, including desktop computers, software and network services.

Any personal data collected and/or used under this contract is subject to the Privacy Act Clause (FAR 52.224-2).  The Contractor will use any Privacy Act information provided by the Government or other Government contractors for the purposes authorized by this contract only and for no other.  The Contractor will not provide the information to any other person or entity, unless explicitly directed.  Each person providing service under this proposal will be required to sign a document of understanding stating that he/she understands and will comply with Privacy Act requirements. Sources of expertise for this particular Information Systems technology are very limited.   Dr. Lewis has extensive and unique knowledge of the medical information system that is critical to operations of the Clinical Center.  The unique knowledge is designer’s knowledge of the internal architecture.  Dr. Lewis brings to the project 21 years of expert experience in developing and implementing the MIS.  His expertise is invaluable as the Clinical Center moves to the selection and implementation of a new hospital information system, the Clinical Research Information System, CRIS.

The first two phases of that project, Concept Definition (Phase 1) and Design and Risk Reduction (Phase 2) are complete.  This contract is a follow-on to the efforts completed under the HAA ACTD Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Under the follow-on contract Lockheed Martin will demonstrate the technical feasibility of the high altitude airship by conducting key risk reduction activities culminating in the build and flight demonstration of a prototype high altitude airship while also maturing technologies required for future operational airships.

No other source has access to the proprietary data, resident expertise and insight to the previous work performed under the HAA ACTD Concept Definition and Design and Risk Reduction Phases, which are as a basis for the follow-on requirement.  This expertise cannot be attained by any other contractor within the anticipated four-year period of performance without substantial duplication of costs.  The estimated value of the contract is $180 million, inclusive of Contractor cost contributions.  The anticipated date of contract award is October 15, 2005.  See Note 22.

*****Note 22:  The proposed contract action is for airship expertise for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement in writing to the Contracting Officer at the address stated below.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) plans to procure on a sole source basis OncotypeDx Testing Services for TAILORx Breast Cancer Trial from Genomic Health, Inc. 301 Penobscot Drive, Redwood, CA 94063.  For a one year base period with two one year options.          

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $10million.  

The DCTD is supporting the Clinical Cooperative Groups to conduct a large trial involving patients with early stage breast cancer.  The trial will test whether patients whose Recurrence Score (RS), as measured by the OncotypeDx assay, falls in the range from 11-25 benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to hormonal therapy.  The OncotypeDx assay (Genomic Health, Inc.), an RT-PCR expression profile, has been shown to reliably predict the risk of recurrence in patients with node negative, hormone receptor positive breast cancer (N Engl J Med.  351:2817-26, 2004).  The Trial Assigning IndividuaLized Options for Treatment (TAILORx) is designed to use a molecular analysis tool the OncotypeDx to select lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancers for treatment that will be tailored according to their risk of recurrence, as measured by the test.  Approximately 1200 patients will have to be tested to identify 4800 with an intermediate RS.  The TAILORx trial is specifically designed to use the OncotypeDx test because this is the only test that has been standardized and evaluated in appropriate specimens from randomized clinical trials.  There is no other equivalent test.  This test is performed in only one place, the CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988) certified laboratory of Genomic Health, Inc. (GHI).  The OncotypeDx test is not a kit that can be purchased to be performed in any clinical laboratory.  Therefore, GHI is the only source for the performance of the OncotypeDx test.

This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, August 5, 2005.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Deborah Moore, Contract Specialist, at dm170b@nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Reference number NCI- 50100-NV must be stated on all correspondence.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intend to acquire services to conduct a community based shoreline cleanup, education, develop long-term coastal stewardship.

STATEMENT OF NEED AND PERFORMANCE REQUIRED

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE

The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS) was designated by Congress in 1992 to protect the humpback whale and its habitat in waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. 

This windward Waiohinu -- Ka Lae (South Point) coastline of Hawaii Island has long been known as a site for accumulation of marine debris.  Kamilo (a site within this area) is described in Native Planters of Old Hawaii: “Its name means ‘swirling currents.’ The currents swept Oregon logs and other flotsam into the small inlet.”  Most of this coastline is very remote and difficult to access over miles of unpaved and torturous lava rubble roads.  This coast is probably the most debris littered coast in the state, primarily due to its difficult access and debris removal difficulties.  Not only is the debris unsightly, it poses an entanglement threat to wildlife and may refloat during storms.  Endangered humpback whales have been documented entangled in derelict marine debris in Hawaii. 

In September 2002, an organization, the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, working with a $10K contract from the State of Hawaii, organized a debris cleanup along a portion of this coastline.  Many organizations and individuals participated.  This 2-day weekend effort covered about 1 mile of coast and involved 2 dump trucks, 2 tractors, several pickup trucks, and 150 volunteers to get 50 tons of debris off the beach and into piles.  Many of the large bundles of line and net were partially buried in the sand, some weighed hundreds of pounds and tractors were the only way these debris bundles could be removed and loaded onto trucks.  Later, over a period of four months the debris piles were reloaded on pickup and dump trucks and taken to a Hawaii County disposal site. 

Subsequent smaller cleanup efforts by Hawaii Wildlife Fund have resulted in large amounts of debris removal as well.  Within a one day trip with about 10 people can easily yield a ton of material.  The HIHWNMS is interested in supporting a collaborative effort to sponsor a more extensive cleanup effort with a contractor with extensive demonstrated experience.

SCOPE OF WORK/OBJECTIVE

A contractor with known, proven talent of a high-level of expertise and capability that can provide the specialized support to the HIHWNMS to conduct a full cleaning of this coastline, educate the community about the problem, and organize a consortium of interested community groups and individuals to begin a regular cleanup schedule.  After this project is completed, the future task will not appear as daunting as at present with decades of debris accumulated on the shore.
 
Working with the State and County governments, other NGOs, community groups and individual volunteers, and contracted tractors and dump trucks, complete the removal of marine debris from this Waiohinu coastline.  This can be accomplished in five two- day events over a period of six months with the debris delivered to the Hawaii County disposal site after each beach cleanup event.  As conducted earlier and found to be a cost-effective process, removal will be a two stage process: 1) volunteers and small tractors will remove debris from the shoreline and place bagged debris and large net/line bundles into piles, 2) larger tractors will load these piles into pickup and dump trucks for transport away from the coastline to the disposal site.  While Hawaii County has been cooperative and supportive of this work in the past, disposal of the debris requires coordination of hauling and dumping debris with operators of the dump site to ensure space availability in the disposal containers.  

This coast is very remote. Access and debris hauling requires slow driving with 4x4 vehicles up to 5 miles to and from the coastline over lava flows and soft volcanic ash. Volunteers will need to be shuttled to the sites in a rented 4x4 van.  Water, sun shelter, and portable toilets need to be provided for the volunteers. Shade covers, cooler chests for water, tables, a winch, and some other debris handling equipment will also be needed.

During these months of shoreline cleanup activities, the contractor will be responsible for obtaining media coverage of the effort and encourage volunteer participation of groups and individuals; volunteer efforts are a necessary component of the beach debris bagging operation.  The media coverage will also inform and educate the general public of the problem and the need for a continuing effort to manage the accumulating debris on this coast. 

During the performance this effort the contractor will attempt to organize those that demonstrate a strong and continuing interest in this work into a dedicated community action group, possibly a coalition of NGOs, that will manage at least a biannual cleanup of this coast in the future.

Solicitation Number:  FA8519-05-R-75816

Set Aside:  Total Small Business

This acquisition is a Small Business Set Aside for a Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract, with 1 Basic year and 3 option years for the purchase of the following:

NSN:  5410-01-494-5130EJ, P/N 9434477-20 Noun:  Dome Shelter 8K
NSN:  5410-01-455-2004EJ, P/N 9434477-30 Noun:  Dome Shelter 4K

NSN:  5410-01-500-7537EJ, P/N 9434477-40 Noun:  Dome Hanger Extension Assembly
NSN:  5410-01-512-3416EJ, P/N 9434477-50 Noun:  Dome Shelter 5K

Dome Shelter Best Estimated Quantities (BEQs)
				Basic		Option I	Option II	Option III
FY05		FY06		FY07		FY08
5410-01-494-5130EJ		9		2		1		1
5410-01-455-2004EJ		11		2		1		1

5410-01-512-3416EJ, 		2		1		1		1

General Characteristics:  The Dome Shelters are a group of shelters used for a variety of applications including warehousing and as an aircraft hanger.  The shelters do not require a foundation and can be erected on both a smooth natural site relatively free of surface rock or on a pre-existing concrete pad.  The domes consist of an aluminum arched frame, tensioned weatherproof fabric, and an electrical system.  The shelters can be erected and disassembled from ground level.  All tools necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package.  The various configurations have different lengths, door types, end walls, and electrical systems.

The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-363-0090EJ) has two Big Mouth Doors that span the shelter width.  It is approximately 60 feet by 60 feet yielding a square footage on the order of 4000 square feet.  The 8K Dome Shelter (5410-01-494-5130EJ) also has two Big Mouth Doors, but has twice as many body panels, approximately doubling the length of the shelter.  The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-455-2004EJ) with gabled (flat) end wall is similar to the 4K Dome Shelter, but a flat end all replaces one of the Big Mouth Doors.

The Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-500-7537EJ) is not a stand alone item.  It contains the components to create a Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-512-3416EJ) that is approximately 5000 square feet, from an existing 4K.  The dome extension contains additional aluminum frame, replacement fabric for the entire shelter, a replacement lighting system, and additional component, including electrical.

Dome Shelters and the Dome Extension Assembly each will require a First Article.  Condition(s) for Waiver of First Article Approval:  Offerors currently in production of the same or similar article for an Air Force contract and who have received First Article approval under the existing contract or offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Air Force, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Air Force or provided not more than 60 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.

Electronic procedures will be posted for this solicitation on or around 15 Apr 05 and will be posted under RFP FA8518-05-R-75816 at http://www.fedbizops.gov/.  Government Data/Drawings will be available for these items and will be posted with the solicitation.

<CONTACT>Lt Chris McCarney, 781-377-0658, Christopher.McCarney@Hanscom.af.mil<br> Gary Scalzi, 781-377-0216, Gary.Scalzi@Hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Geodesic Dome Array Antenna with Digital Beam Forming For Distress Alerting Satellite Service<br> General Information<br> This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis.  The following information is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting market research of industry to identify sources of commercial and manufactured items that meet Air Force requirements. <br> This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. There will be no reimbursement for the information provided.  AFRL is considering competing select service providers and carries special requirements as defined, but not limited to, selection criteria noted in this synopsis.  Please mail or e-mail qualification statements by ***DATE*** to either POC identified below. <br> Description<br> The Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate, Antenna Technology Branch (AFRL/SNHA), Hanscom Research Site (HRS), is seeking capable sources to perform detailed design, implementation and integration tasks, in support of a current design concept, for an outside agency. Anticipated deliverables include a ground-based antenna and all accompanying articles.  The technologies and/or technology applications will be considered for system development efforts beginning in Fiscal Year 2006, with an approximated 36 month delivery schedule. Distress Alerting Satellite Service The Distress Alerting Satellite Service (DASS) will be used to provide civilian search and rescue (SAR) personnel with the capability to quickly identify and accurately locate persons in need of rescue services.  Some noted aspects of the DASS architecture and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) include: <br> -	406 MHz distress beacon (user segment) <br> -	SAR "bent pipe" transponder (space segment) on BPS BLKs IIR/IIF/II constellations<br> -	Ground stations receive, process, and distribute distress, alert, and location data from GPS satellites to the SAR network<br> The SAR transponder on each of the GPS satellites is a "bent pipe" repeater that relays the 406 MHz beacon signals to the DASS ground stations via an L-band down link frequency (1544.9MHz).  The ground station antenna for DASS must meet following basic specs: <br> -	Down link frequency: 1544.8-1545.0 MHz (Center frequency: 1544.9 MHz) <br> -	G/T=8 dB/K<br> -	Data rate: 15 kbps per beam, 8 beams per site<br> -	Satellite payload transmitter: EIRP > 15 dBW over the entire earth<br> -	Polarization will be left-hand or right-hand circular (CP) <br> -	Antenna will be receive-only. No transmit capability required. <br> Geodesic Dome Array Antenna<br> AFRL/SNHA performed a preliminary ground station antenna architecture study and concluded that a Geodesic Dome Array Antenna (GDAA), with digital beam forming (DBF), is optimal for the DASS.  Studies have shown that a single GDAA could accommodate 8 simultaneous beams, in a hemispherical coverage. The GDAA is essentially a spherical array, with curved surfaces approximated by flat facets, or subarrays.  Each subarray, in the proposed concept, consists of a multi-layer panel and digital receiver at each element.  A typical panel structure is envisioned to have layers for radiating elements, RF calibration, 90 degree hybrids for circular polarization (CP), local oscillator (LO) signals, and power distribution.  The digital receivers will primarily consist of a front-end low noise amplifier (LNA) and an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. Digital data from each receiver may be processed in one of two ways: (1) Partial processing at the subarray level, to form eight subarray beams, for subsequent combination in a central processor to form the eight GD beams.  (2) Complete processing done in a single central processor to form the eight GD beams.  In either case each of the eight GD beams will be assigned to a visible GPS satellite by an antenna resource management computer.  Detailed DBF parameters will be specifically addressed after potential integrators have been identified. <br> Capabilities & Efforts<br> AFRL seeks integrators that will utilize GPS commercial off the shelf (COTS) components as material solutions where available, while maintaining the ability to manufacture specialized elements (i.e. multi-layer array panels).  Due to the short suspense, AFRL will entertain only those providers with previous experience in related (as deemed appropriate by AFRL) antenna fabrication and DBF projects.  Responses are highly encouraged by those service providers with mature planar phased array antenna manufacturing technologies and DBF network implementation. The potential effort will include: participating in, planning, and conducting system design, prototype fabrication, testing, and delivery. The efforts may also include, but are not limited to, technology demonstrations, evaluation programs and field exercises; develop test plan documentation; analysis, evaluation, and documentation of  technical data. The selected contractor will be expected to provide technical project planning and coordination; prepare and present formal and informal briefings; attend technical meetings for the purpose of providing technical expertise.  In addition, the contractor will be expected to develop, maintain, and document an appropriate GDAA cost model. Responses Where applicable and appropriate, white papers should directly compare and contrast capabilities with current COTS items or known developmental efforts with respect to improvements, limitations, weight, size, cost, power density, capacity, duration, dynamic range of performance, ease of production and use.  Specific performance data and materials compatibility information should be provided.  Any information submitted in response to this synopsis is strictly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.  Offerors having the technical skills and capabilities to perform the stated requirement are invited to provide information to contribute to this market survey/sources sought.  Interested offerors should address in their written response whether they can fulfill this requirement.  Responses shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, email address, business size and small business status such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned, teaming partners and/or major subcontractors or prime.  Responses should address how the Offeror can meet any part or all of the above requirements and should not exceed three (3) pages in total. AFRL will review all submittals to this posting, respond appropriately, and make recommendations regarding ability to serve and perform in the government's recommended capacity.  Recommendations will also be made for future capabilities briefings, between government personnel and potential service providers.  Such correspondence may include site visits, in order to gain first-hand knowledge of competence.  While all responses to a future Request for Proposal will be accepted and reviewed, ARFL does not wish to dissipate resources, both government and contractor. <br> References<br> B. Tomasic et al.

<DESC>The purpose of the amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation is to provide all potential offerors with a copy of the questions and answers that have been asked and answered regarding this solicitation.

W-Band Klystron Amplifier (Radar Transmitter) 

The klystron requires a load VSWR of 1.2:1, maximum.  In the block diagram an output isolator or circulator is not shown.***

1.  Is an output isolator required in the transmitter?

The transmitter will be connected to an "external" circulator assembly (not required as part of this procurement) to provide the correct match to the antenna. The circulator assembly has a return loss of -28.2 dB (VSWR 1.08:1). For additional testing purposes, NOAA is will purchase a high powered load with the correct VSWR ( 1.10:1) to match the transmitter requirements.*** 


2. Is the output isolator or circulator included in the block labeled T/R Switch?

NOAA has purchased the circulator as part of the T/R switch assembly. The assembly consists of a high power three port circulator and two cascaded low loss receiver protection switches (switched ferrite circulators), from EMS, Norcross Georgia.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation is to provide all potential offerors with a copy of the questions and answers that have been asked and answered regarding this solicitation.  Please note that the due date for proposals has been extended.  See note 6 below.***


1.      What exactly do you mean by "phase-locked detection of the cantilever motion"?  Does this mean frequency feedback to maintain constant phase? 

No, it was simply meant to indicate lock-in detection of the photodiode signal so that the phase as well as amplitude signal could be obtained. This was not clear as written.*** 


2.      What application requires the photodiode performance in the spec (3dB or less at 5MHz)? 

A primary use of this AFM will be to measure the frequencies of the resonant modes of the AFM cantilever when the tip is in contact with a sample. The third flexural mode of the typical cantilevers used (spring constant approx. 40-50 N/m) occurs between approximately 3 and 5 MHz. 

Note that our spec requires a bandwidth to 5 MHz without a specified rolloff. The spec mentioned by the vendor (3 dB or less at 5 MHz) is preferred only.*** 


3.      Why is the Z noise spec so high (0.25nm)? 

The primary application requires very precise control over the applied forces in order to make as accurate quantitative measurements as possible. Because most (if not all) AFMs operate in constant deflection mode instead of constant force mode, this spec was meant to represent force control. 

In scoring, a proposal will be awarded half the points for this category if it meets the stated spec. If the vendor can provide a better Z noise spec, the proposal will be awarded more points, up to the full number of points for that category.*** 


4.      Provide a list of "existing programs and files" that the AFM system computer must interface to. 

The programs and files mentioned are primarily LabView programs written in-house. 

The phrase occurs in a spec concerning the computer operating system. NIST computer policy requires that a computer have Windows XP or newer in order to be connected to the internal network, providing security/passwords, virus protection, ease of file access, etc.*** 


5.      What is the acceptance criteria for the system?  Please provide acceptance tests and protocol. 

At the time of system installation/training, the NIST end user(s) will go over the specs given in the Solicitation jointly with the vendor representative on the installed instrument and determine if the specifications are satisfied.***

6.  PROPOSAL DUE DATE:  The due date for proposals has been extended from Friday, July 29, 2005 to Wednesday, August 3, 2005, 4:30 p.m. local time.

<DESC>NAICS Codes: 334513 thru 334519    SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY- This is not a solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) in EPA’s Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting preliminary market research for informational purposes only to determine if there are Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) that can offer a large assortment of laboratory supplies and equipment for EPA laboratories located in Ada, OK, Athens, GA, Cincinnati, OH, Corvallis, OR, Duluth, MN, Edison, NJ, Grosse Ile, MI, Gulf Breeze, FL, Las Vegas, NV, Narragansett, RI, Newport, OR, and Research Triangle Park, NC.  Based on the responses to this market research, the government will ascertain whether it will be in its best interest to establish BPAs with SDVOSBs to provide laboratory supplies and equipment.  SDVOSBs capability statements must include information that supports its ability to provide the listed products (written agreements evidencing the SDVOSB as an authorized dealer/distributor).  Also, please keep in mind that as a small business set-aside, SDVOSBs that propose to provide a product over $25,000 that it did not manufacture can only provide the product of a small business manufacturer.  FAR 19.502-2 (c) states “For small business set-asides other than for construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer, unless the Small Business Administration (SBA) has granted a waiver or exception to the non-manufacturer rule...SBA has excepted procurements processed under simplified acquisitions procedures where the anticipated cost of the procurement will not exceed $25,000, from the manufacturer rule.”   The supplies and equipment listed in the capability statements will be used to determine if the EPA laboratories have a recurring need for the type of products being offered.  No feedback will be provided to companies regarding its individual capability statement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought announcement.  The capability statements should be sent via email to sugg.ruby@epa.gov.  The due date for the capability statements is 3:00 PM on August 12, 2005.  Questions must be submitted in writing to sugg.ruby@epa.gov.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: Philadelphia Area New National Cemetery; RFI: VA-786A-05-RI-0005 Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) firm capable to preparing a Master Plan, all design development documentation, schematics, construction documents, construction period services and site visits for Phase I of the new Philadelphia Area National Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The proposed acquisition is a 100% Small Business set-aside. Prime contractor shall have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm or team, with experience in planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreation facilities, or similar land development projects. The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines shall be members of the firm, or team which demonstrate expertise in their respective fields: Civil Engineer, Natural Resources Specialist, Water Management/Irrigation specialist and Architect. This project is to be divided into two contractual phases: Phase I is the development and completion of a Master Plan, to the schematic design level, for the entire cemetery facility, and Design Development design and study reports for the Phase I Development area. Phase II shall be exercised at the option of the government to prepare construction documents, drawings and specifications for all site work, buildings and features contained in Phase I development of the cemetery. The overall goal of the Master Plan is to provide approximately 169,500 interment spaces within the entire cemetery plus the buildings, roads, etc. described below to meet the needs for burials through year 2040. The goal of the Phase I Development is to develop approximately 16,000 gravesites for casket interments including 13,500 pre-placed crypts, 9,000-niche columbarium(s) and 1,500 in-ground sites for cremated remains, and a garden for scattering cremated remains. This first phase will include a fast-track burial area, with temporary administrative and maintenance facilities, a temporary committal shelter, minimal roads, utilities and irrigation system. Ultimately, the total Phase I project will develop approximately 65 acres to provide for approximately a ten-year inventory of gravesites to accommodate burials through year 2017. In addition to gravesite development, the construction includes an entrance area, flag and assembly area, four committal service shelters, public information center with restrooms, administration and maintenance complex, roads, utilities, signage, site furnishings, fencing, and landscape planting. It is the intent of the VA to use very basic conceptual layouts by NCA staff (to be furnished to the A/E) as the starting point for the design. Development of a Master Plan for a new national cemetery in the Philadelphia area includes the Environmental Assessment (EA) as the initial step in VA capital facilities planning. Copies of preliminary EA1 will be provided to selected A/E team. The Department of Veterans Affairs considers the total environmental approach a necessity to good master planning. The planning process must be founded upon a sound understanding of the features and dynamics of the environment. The selected cemetery site is composed of a variety of components: topography, soils, plant communities, wildlife habitats, riparian features, etc. Each component must be understood and interpreted as a contributing element to the natural functioning and development of the site. The existing landscape must be an integral part of the plan. The goal of the Master Plan is to provide an orderly, professional, and aesthetic development plan for the entire cemetery site of approximately 250 acres. The completed Master Plan will consist of the required drawings, details, studies and reports of all the elements listed in this Scope of Work and in the revised A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects. The completed Master Plan should be sufficiently detailed to enable the Department of Veterans Affairs to proceed directly into the preparation of Schematics and Design Development Drawings for the Phase I development and for future development phases of the cemetery. The Master Plan for the Philadelphia Area National Cemetery will include the design and location of the following: Entrance Area; Public Information Center with Cortege Assembly Area and Rest Rooms (900 gsf); Administration and Maintenance Complex, with service yard and parking; Flag Assembly Area; Memorial Walkway and Donations Area; Committal Service Shelters (2); Roadway System and Parking; Cremated Remains-approximately 1,500 in-ground cremains, garden niche or terrace sites, approximately 9,000 columbarium(s) niches, and garden for scattering of cremated remains; Grading, Drainage, and Plantings; Utility Distribution Systems; Irrigation System; Avenue of Flags; Veterans Memorial; Carillon Tower Location The schematics and design development will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost. The construction documents and construction period services shall be awarded at the option of the government. In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the estimating capabilities of the applicants. Applicants must have an established working office within 75 miles of the work site, of sufficient size as to be able to provide timely response and experience to accomplish the work and be licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Firms must indicate in response whether they meet the requirements for a small business concern. Preference will be given to firms with working offices in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. No firm will be considered unless an application consisting of completed SF 330 Part I and other evidence of experience and capabilities that the applicant considers relevant is received by the Project Manager, James Griffin, at Project Management Service (41F1), 811 Vermont Ave. N.W., Suite 235, Washington, DC 20005. Project Manager's phone number is (202) 565-4943. Three (3) copies are required within 30 days of the date of this advertisement. A current SF 330 Part II, representing and differentiating between the personnel, experience and capabilities of all involved offices, must be included with the application together with Current SF 330 part IIs for each proposed consultant's office involved. Applicants will be rated based on the relevant experience of both the firm(s) and assigned individuals, the applicant's consideration, the participation of Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, the participation of Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, the participation of minority-owned and women-owned consultants and demonstrate success in prescribing the use of recovered materials and achieving waste reduction and energy efficiency in facility design. Award of contract is dependent upon the availability of funds. This is not a request for a proposal. Note "covenant against contingent fee" clause is applicable to this solicitation."

Background a. The current U.S. Army Watercraft C4ISR/CEN equipment is outdated, unsupportable, and not designed for easy integration of new capability/technology.  It is our intention to transform the current outdated capability by taking advantage of advancements in  technology in communications and navigation equipment.  Further, we will no longer depend on paper charts or be satisfied with limited range of communication.  We must be able to communicate between U.S. joint services, Coalition forces, and civilian and host nation ships; as well as from ship to shore, vehicle to vessel and from one continent to another worldwide.  By taking advantage of current navigation technologies the vessel operators will gain the use of more advanced equipmente allowing for improve d satellite coverage, identification of friend or foe IIFF) systems, and digital charting which enhances the operator's navigation capabilities. b. To meet these goals we must procure C4ISR/CEN systems that:    (1) are state-of-the art    (2) are designed to be easily and economically upgraded as technology advances    (3) provide capability for communictions across joint services, between Army, Navy, Air Force, USMC, Coast Guard, Coalition forces, and civilian and host nation ships and personnel via secure and/or non-secure voice and data tactical and satellite modes . c.  Our current priority within the Army's fleet of watrcraft is the Landing Craft, Utility boat, the LCU-2000.  This vessel was fielded 12 to 15 years ago.  Thirty-one (31) vessels require upgrading. The communication suites are not equipped to operate in  a joint military environment.  The majority of the present LCU-2000 equipment is Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS).  Due to age of these systems and advances in technology they are logistically unsupportable.  Additionally, the majority of the fleet does no t comply with many of the current United States Coast Guard *USCG) regulations, International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations, and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations and/or the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). d.  In June 2005 the Army completed development of a prototype Navigation and Communication (C4I/CEN) suite for the LCU 2000 class of vessels.   This effort is being documented in the form of a Modification Work Order (MWO), which is expected to be complet e in August 2005.  The prototype suite will establish the configuration and identify the types of equipment to be incorporated by name, model number, and quantity.  Drawings, Technical Manuals, and Training Material being developed along with the MWO to su ppo rt the vessels and the C4I/CEN operations will be validated and verified against upon completion of the fleet installation/upgrade process.   When finalized, the MWO will be used to develop a Scope of Work to support awarding a contracting effort to upgrad e C4ISR/CEN equipment on the LCU fleet.  The contract is anticipated to include procurement and installation of the suite on the LCU fleet. IV.  Present Acquisition Requirements a. The Level 1 drawing(s), Technical Manuals, and Training Material developed from the prototype effort will be provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP) phase and the post award effort. This information will be part of the materials provided to any Offer or under this acquisition. b. At the present time funding is uncertain.  PM AWS is actively seeking program funds to modify all 31 vessels.  Funding will likely be spread over more than one fiscal year, and may never be adequate to modify the entire fleet.  We hope to secure a porti on of the necessary funding as early as FY06, however, no funding presently exists in our budget for this effort.   c.  The U.S. Army's LCU-2000s are positioned in at least four (4) different locations worldwide.  The locations are Kuwait; Japan; Ft. Eustis, VA, and Mare Island, CA.  Note that Kuwait is considered a war zone.  Depending on the amount and timing/availabi lity of funding allocated for this effort work could be required to be simultaneously executed at multiple locations, on multiple vessels.  The present location of LCU-2000 vessels is subject to change and therefore exact quantities of vessels at each loca tion will not be provided with this request for information. d.  The C4ISR equipment, while not secret, is classified operational security (OPSEC)sensitive and requires special handling, storage, and clearance.  Employees handling any COMSEC sensitive equipment and/or material will need to have a verifiable secret c learance.  In addition, the contractor's facility will require clearance prior to handling or performance of any effort relative to the COMSEC portion of the LCU-2000 C4ISR installation effort.  Securing Facility Clearance entails the completion of the Con tract Security Classification Specifications (DD Form 254) form, and a NSS facility review and approval.  The DD Form 254 is designed to provide security requirements and classification guidance needed for performance of a classified contract or one where handling of security sensitive equipment or data will be required.  The DD Form 254 will be annotated as to the security requirements that the Contractor and any/all related subcontracts/subcontracts must adhere to for the immediate/specific contract. e.  Contractor personnel assigned to the LCU-2000 C4I/CEN installation effort shall be capable of handling and processing information, material, and equipment at the appropriate security level throughout this effort and shall be fully trained and competent m in the use and operation of the C4I/CEN, having licenses for the tasks where licensing is required.  Upon written request of the government all validation and verification of qualifications, certifications, licenses and security clearances shall be provi ded to the contracting office. f. The MWO is not complete, however the following is a partial list of the major components for the Navigation and Communication suite equipment that will be placed onboard each LCU-2000 vessel.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a contract to the National Committee for Quality Assurance pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intents to procure the unique services of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) to assist CMS in the collection and management of the annual HEDIS data submission for Medicare Advantage managed care organizations.  CMS also requires the Contractor's specialized capabilities in the development and testing of new quality of care performance measures for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries.  Since January 1997, Medicare managed care organizations (MCOs) have been required to annually report performance measures from the Health Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS).  HEDIS is a widely used set of health plan performance measures employed by both private and public health care purchasers to promote accountability and to assess the quality of care provided by managed care organizations.  Originally designed for private employers'needs as purchasers of healthcare, HEDIS has been adapted for use by public purchasers, government compliance monitors, and managed care consumers.  HEDIS is developed and maintained by the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) with input from other health care stakeholders, providers/practitioners, managed care organizations, consumers and federal government health agencies.   
Annually CMS collects a subset of the HEDIS measure set.  It is critical to CMS's mission that we continue to collect and disseminate information that will help beneficiaries choose among health plans (consumer information); information that contributes to better health care through the identification of quality improvement opportunities (quality assurance); and provides for proper oversight and management of the Medicare Program  (program oversight).  Our working relationship with NCQA contributes significantly to the attainment of these goals.  
CMS requires an experienced contractor to provide and maintain an information system and IT infrastructure to collect and support submission of HEDIS measures data for Medicare Advantage plans and generate a database on Medicare plans.  In addition to providing MA plans with data submission tools and instructions with detailed technical specifications for submitting HEDIS measures, the contractor must facilitate and provide technical support and assistance to individual Medicare Advantage plans as they submit data according to Medicare requirements.  The effort will be for a twelve month period of performance.  This notice is a notice of intent to negotiate and award a contract to NCQA and should not be considered a request for proposals.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement that will be considered by the agency.  The statement must demonstrate that the firm(s) has capability to perform the required work.  All capability statements must be submitted via email to Joanne Day at:  Joanne.Day@cms.hhs.gov on or before August 25, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  CMS will not reimburse costs for submission of capability information.  The NAICS code for this action is 541710.   See FedBizOpps Numbered Note 22.

Any information you provide will be kept entirely confidential and is not for the purpose of “pre-qualifying” contractors.



Market research questions:

1.  For what non-federal or non-DOD entities does (or has) your company provide(d) transient alert services?  Include state, municipal, or other local government entities, as well as non-government entities.  If possible, provide a copy of the terms and conditions of the contract, or provide contact information where we can obtain information regarding the terms and conditions.

2.  If you are considering competing for this contract, what types of information will facilitate your ability to develop a competitive, fixed-price offer (nature of information and degree/quantity)?  What risks would make it difficult for you to develop such an offer?

3.  If your company normally provides transient alert services and has decided not to compete for this contract, what constraints within USAF control contributed to the decision?

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES
Smart Card Technology


Description:  The government is seeking information concerning the availability of FIPS-201-compliant 128K smart card products and supporting components.  

Background: On August 27, 2004, Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 12: Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors was signed.  As a result of this Directive, the National Institute of Standards and Technology issued Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 201: Personal Identity Verification for Federal Employees and Contractors, which provides the requirements for a uniform identity credential for access to Federal facilities and systems as designated by HSPD-12.  The Standard is supported by Special Publication (SP) 800-73: Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, SP 800-78: Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, and draft SP 800-76: Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification.  

A number of Federal agencies plan to add additional data beyond the mandatory elements in the card (e.g. additional PKI certificates), which will cause them to immediately approach the full capacity of standard 64k smart cards.  The government is interested in learning more about potential near-term solutions with larger data storage capacity, and therefore seeks answers to the following questions:  

1.  How soon could a 128K dual interface Smart Card that complies with technical requirements of FIPS-201 and SP 800-73 be developed, tested, manufactured and made available to government acquisition officers?

2.  When will they be available in sufficient quantities to meet government needs (approximately 150,000 cards per month over a period of two to three years)?

3.  Will this 128K dual interface Smart Card incorporate Global Platform and be certified as Version 2.2?

4.  How will the move to 128K Smart Cards impact current implementations using 64K Smart Cards (middleware, software, readers etc)?

5.  Will the cards have the ability to generate 2048bit RSA /224 bit Elliptic Curve key algorithms?

6.  Will the cards have the ability to perform functions using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithms?

7.  What performance implications are there for 128K smart cards?

8.  What are the projected relative costs for FIPS-compliant 128K smart cards versus 64K smart cards?

9.  What other considerations should the government be aware of when moving to 128K Smart Card products?

Concerns about the implementation of biometrics are central in the government’s interest in the higher capacity smart card.  In order to better understand the state of industry thinking on the subject of biometrics, the government also seeks answers to the following questions concerning the implementation of biometrics on smart cards:

10.  In the event the government elects to use biometric fingerprint image, what products are available to meet the IMAGE transfer and use today that could be evaluated for both the desktop and in conjunction with physical security door readers and as handheld devices?  

11.  What are the performance parameters for these IMAGE processing devices?

12.  In the case of fingerprint minutiae, what minutiae templates and algorithms do you support?  To which national or international standards do they conform?

13.  One suggestion is that the government might incorporate both IMAGE and MINUTIAE fingerprint biometric capabilities into its smart cards.  How does the need to support multiple biometric technologies impact the cost of readers and other ancillary devices and software?

14.  What are the cost differentials between readers capable of processing IMAGE fingerprint biometrics versus MINUTAIE fingerprint biometrics?

15.  What are the performance differentials between devices that support IMAGE versus MINUTIAE biometrics?
 
16.  What other considerations should the government take into account when making a determination to adopt either IMAGE or MINUTAIE fingerprint biometrics?

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to this Request for Information (RFI) for industry interest in a partnership for providing various commodities to JPL using eBusiness purchasing practices, specifically focusing on Oracle Module “iProcurement.” Contracts with JPL are funded by NASA and are subcontracted under a NASA prime contract with Caltech.  The Laboratory will consider making this effort a small business set-aside. BACKGROUND: The Laboratory’s current Just-In-Time (JIT) eBusiness system provides a mechanism for the expedited acquisition of frequently purchased commodities at JPL.  Just-In-Time was developed to satisfy the business operational needs associated with planning, purchasing, receiving, delivering and paying for commodities, as well as facilitate a faster requisition-to-delivery-turnaround. When initially implemented, JIT had a limited user base of employees; however with the enhancement of the application to allow for web-base order entry its user-base increased to include the entire JPL population. JPL currently has a JIT ordering system that includes the following commodities: (1) Software; (2) Office supplies and paper; (3) Chemicals; (4) Critical environmental products; (5) Laboratory supplies; (6) Cryogenics and gases; (7) Seating; and (8) Unix hardware. It is now approximately six (6) years since JPL implemented Oracle as its institutional business system. Both JPL’s business process and the original system architecture have changed significantly during that period. Oracle’s relational database and associated financial application suites have provided new opportunities for enhanced reporting and business process improvement. iProcurement is an Oracle COTS product that provides similar functionality to the current JIT business processes. Like JIT, iProcurement provides an intuitive, web-shopping interface that allows users to quickly find and purchase various commodities and provides the complete catalog and content management capabilities. The iProcurement system better enables Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing of orders, cancel and return data transmission. The Laboratory is interested in establishing an Indefinite Delivery Subcontract (IDS) with suppliers that can provide eBusiness system support for the purchase of frequently purchased commodities at JPL. The Laboratory is planning on eventually transitioning these commodities to iProcurement in the future. Also, of particular interest is solicitation of electronic parts and components using this electronic ordering approach.  JPL is open to consideration of other commodities that are being provided to customers using eBusiness. Your company is requested to present your capabilities in response to this RFI by providing the following:   (a) Name and address of company; (b) Name of contact person, phone, email and fax number; (c) Commodity and list of core product lines that your company provides; (d) Your affirmative interest in future procurement opportunities; and (e) A short description of your eBusiness system and your ability to communicate with Oracle iProcurement. In addition, please address the following to assist in JPL’s implementation:  CONTENT MANAGEMENT  1.  Describe your company’s ability to conduct business with Oracle iProcurement customers (please list customers and provide Oracle release if known). Specifically, provide a current contact person and phone number for two of these customers. 2.  Does your company currently conduct any business through Oracle Exchange?  If so, describe your process. 3.  Does your company maintain catalog data in an exportable format (tab-delimited, XML, CIF, or cXML)?	 a.  If so, describe how these files are properly formatted for bulk load onto Oracle iProcurement or Oracle Exchange. 4.  Does your company provide a website for searching through an online catalog, order placement and checkout?  Please provide the website URL, if so. a.  Is the website SSL certified? b.  Does your company maintain a test website that customers could connect to for testing purposes?  c.  How often has your production website been down in the last twelve (12) months and for how long each time? d.  Will you maintain a customer specific catalog on your website for online order placement and checkout?  If so, describe your ability to restrict items from displaying within online catalogs for your customers. Also, describe your standard process for updating customer specific online catalogs as it pertains to items being added or removed and price changes. e.  Describe how you provide an estimated delivery date for each item ordered. 5.  Does your company support punchout?   a.  If so, describe which formats (Oracle XML, cXML, or via Oracle Exchange). b.  Describe the kind of customizations you can provide. Example: JPL specific list of items with JPL negotiated delivery dates or bringing back JPL specific item attribute data such as recycled content percentage. c.  Discuss how many buying customers you conduct business with through punchout. 6.  Describe your company’s ability to support transparent punchout. a.  Discuss how many buying customers you conduct business with through transparent punchout. PURCHASE ORDER DELIVERY 1.

Discuss your standard policy for the return or cancellation of an order. 7.  Describe your standard turnaround time for a delivery. 8.  Discuss your company’s ability to provide desktop delivery.  9.  Discuss whether your company currently bar-code packages for your customers.  Items to cover include: a.  Describe the format that the machine-readable code is in. b.  Describe how it is bar-coded, by package or item ordered. c.  Describe if the bar code is in a custom format that is customer specific, a standard company format, or a UPS/FedEx bar code.  If it is custom or company format, what information is contained in the bar code? d.  Describe other customization that is available and if you can include the PO #, Line # and Quantity in the bar code. 10.  Describe your company’s ability to provide Advanced Shipment Notices (ASNs). a.  Discuss the electronic delivery format. b.  Discuss the content that is provided in the ASN. 11.  Discuss if your system can handle an invoice-less process with a 10-day payment terms, and only receive a remittance advice with payment. Example: Subcontract is setup in JPL’s system with an evaluated receipt settlement process that creates an invoice at the time of receipt and processes that invoice for payment within ten (10) days. RESPONSES DUE: Please submit your expression of interest and any applicable information by July 28, 2005 to: JPL, Attention: Business Opportunities Office, Mail Stop 190-205, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109-8099; Phone: (818) 354-7532. DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL will solicit you for such procurement in the future.  Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information.  Be advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technology/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Caltech/JPL), operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), seek responses to this Request for Information (RFI) for industry interest in a partnership for providing various commodities to JPL using eBusiness purchasing practices, specifically focusing on Oracle Module “iProcurement.” Contracts with JPL are funded by NASA and are subcontracted under a NASA prime contract with Caltech.  The Laboratory will consider making this effort a small business set-aside. BACKGROUND: The Laboratory’s current Just-In-Time (JIT) eBusiness system provides a mechanism for the expedited acquisition of frequently purchased commodities at JPL.  Just-In-Time was developed to satisfy the business operational needs associated with planning, purchasing, receiving, delivering and paying for commodities, as well as facilitate a faster requisition-to-delivery-turnaround. When initially implemented, JIT had a limited user base of employees; however with the enhancement of the application to allow for web-base order entry its user-base increased to include the entire JPL population. JPL currently has a JIT ordering system that includes the following commodities: (1) Software; (2) Office supplies and paper; (3) Chemicals; (4) Critical environmental products; (5) Laboratory supplies; (6) Cryogenics and gases; (7) Seating; and (8) Unix hardware. It is now approximately six (6) years since JPL implemented Oracle as its institutional business system. Both JPL’s business process and the original system architecture have changed significantly during that period. Oracle’s relational database and associated financial application suites have provided new opportunities for enhanced reporting and business process improvement. iProcurement is an Oracle COTS product that provides similar functionality to the current JIT business processes. Like JIT, iProcurement provides an intuitive, web-shopping interface that allows users to quickly find and purchase various commodities and provides the complete catalog and content management capabilities. The iProcurement system better enables Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) processing of orders, cancel and return data transmission. The Laboratory is interested in establishing an Indefinite Delivery Subcontract (IDS) with suppliers that can provide eBusiness system support for the purchase of frequently purchased commodities at JPL. The Laboratory is planning on eventually transitioning these commodities to iProcurement in the future. Also, of particular interest is solicitation of electronic parts and components using this electronic ordering approach.  JPL is open to consideration of other commodities that are being provided to customers using eBusiness. Your company is requested to present your capabilities in response to this RFI by providing the following:   (a) Name and address of company; (b) Name of contact person, phone, email and fax number; (c) Commodity and list of core product lines that your company provides; (d) Your affirmative interest in future procurement opportunities; and (e) A short description of your eBusiness system and your ability to communicate with Oracle iProcurement. In addition, please address the following to assist in JPL’s implementation:  CONTENT MANAGEMENT  1.  Describe your company’s ability to conduct business with Oracle iProcurement customers (please list customers and provide Oracle release if known). Specifically, provide a current contact person and phone number for two of these customers. 2.  Does your company currently conduct any business through Oracle Exchange?  If so, describe your process. 3.  Does your company maintain catalog data in an exportable format (tab-delimited, XML, CIF, or cXML)?	 a.  If so, describe how these files are properly formatted for bulk load onto Oracle iProcurement or Oracle Exchange. 4.  Does your company provide a website for searching through an online catalog, order placement and checkout?  Please provide the website URL, if so. a.  Is the website SSL certified? b.  Does your company maintain a test website that customers could connect to for testing purposes?  c.  How often has your production website been down in the last twelve (12) months and for how long each time? d.  Will you maintain a customer specific catalog on your website for online order placement and checkout?  If so, describe your ability to restrict items from displaying within online catalogs for your customers. Also, describe your standard process for updating customer specific online catalogs as it pertains to items being added or removed and price changes. e.  Describe how you provide an estimated delivery date for each item ordered. 5.  Does your company support punchout?   a.  If so, describe which formats (Oracle XML, cXML, or via Oracle Exchange). b.  Describe the kind of customizations you can provide. Example: JPL specific list of items with JPL negotiated delivery dates or bringing back JPL specific item attribute data such as recycled content percentage. c.  Discuss how many buying customers you conduct business with through punchout. 6.  Describe your company’s ability to support transparent punchout. a.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST),  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Picosecond Pulse Labs for two (2) pulse generators.  The first generator must meet the following critical specifications:  1) Rise- or fall-time of less than 15 ps but more than 10 ps; 2) Pulse amplitude of 0.2 V; 3) 50 nominal source impedance; 4) Externally triggered operation with repetition rate of 500 kHz or more; 5) Internal trigger source with repetition rate of 500 kHz or more; 6) Jitter between output pulse and trigger of less than 1.5 ps; and 7) 1.85 MM coaxial output connector.  The model 4015D-307 meets the criteria required.  The second generator must meet the following critical specifications:  1) Rise- or fall-time of less than 5 ps; 2) Pulse amplitude of 0.2 V; 3) 50 nominal source impedance; 4) Externally triggered operation with variable repetition rate between 100 kHz and 10 MHz or more; 5) Internal trigger source; 6) Jitter between output pulse and external trigger of less than 0.5 ps; and 7) 1.85 MM coaxial output connector.  The model 4016A-307 meets the criteria required.  The most critical specification for both units is number 1 because pulse must be fast enough to stress the equipment.  This unit will be used for testing high speed electrical equipment within the laboratory.  Market research has been conducted and it is the Government’s belief there in no other unit(s) commercially available than can meet this criteria.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).  This synopsis is issued for information only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Award date will be August 11, 2005.

<DESC>I.  The Product Manager, Army Watercraft Systems (PM AWS) intends to pursue modification programs to upgrade the C4ISR/CEN systems on fielded watercraft systems.  The intent of this request for information is to determine if interested and capable co mmercial sources exist to execute such an effort.  This questionnaire focuses on upgrading the C4ISR/CEN equipment on the fleet of Landing Craft, Utility (LCU-2000) vessels, however, the responses to this questionnaire will assist PM AWS in planning and im plementation of current and future modification programs on Army Watercraft.   II.  Definitions     C4ISR	Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence,                              Surveillance and Reconnaissance     C4I/CEN 	C4ISR and CEN abbreviated     CEN	Communications, Electronics and Navigation     CFR		Code of Federal Regulations     COMSEC	Communications Security     CONUS	Continental United States     COTS	Commercial off the Shelf     IFF 		Identification of Friend or Foe     IMO	International Maritime Organization     LCU	Landing Craft, Utility      LCU-2000 	Landing Craft, Utility vessel     MWO	Material Work Order     NSS		National Security Strategy office     OCONUS	Outside the Continental United States     OPSEC   	Operational Security      RFP		Request for Proposal     SOLAS	Safety of Life at Sea III. Background a. The current U.S. Army Watercraft C4ISR/CEN equipment is outdated, unsupportable, and not designed for easy integration of new capability/technology.  It is our intention to transform the current outdated capability by taking advantage of the advancement s in technology in communications and navigation equipment.   Further, we will no longer depend on paper charts or be satisfied with limited range of communication.  We must be able to communicate between U.S. joint services, Coalition forces, and civilian  and host nation ships; as well as from ship to shore, vehicle to vessel and from one continent to another worldwide.   By taking advantage of current navigation technologies the vessel operators will gain the use of more advanced equipment allowing for im proved satellite coverage, identification of friend or foe (IFF) systems, and digital charting which enhances the operators navigation capabilities.  b. To meet these goals we must procure C4ISR/CEN systems that:      (1) Are state-of-the art      (2) Are designed to be easily and economically upgraded as technology advances      (3) Provide capability for communications across joint services, between the Army, Navy, Air Force, USMC, Coast Guard, Coalition forces, and civilian and host nation ships and personnel via secure and/or non-secure voice and data tactical and satellit e modes.    c. Our current priority within the Armys fleet of watercraft is the Landing Craft, Utility boat, LCU-2000.  This vessel was fielded 12 to 15 years ago.  Thirty-one (31) vessels require upgrading.  The communication suites are not equipped to operate in a joint military environment.  The majority of the present LCU-2000 equipment is Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS).  Due to age of these systems and advances in technology they are logistically unsupportable.  Additionally, the majority of fleet does not compl y with many of the current United States Coast Guard (USCG) regulations, International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations, and Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) regulations and/or the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).   d. In June 2005 the Army completed development of a prototype Navigation and Communication (C4I/CEN) suite for the LCU 2000 class of vessels.   This effort is being documented in the form of a Modification Work Order (MWO), which is expected to be complete  in August 2005.  The prototype suite will establish the configuration and identify the types of equipment to be incorporated by name, model number, and quantity.  Drawings, Technical Manuals, and Training Material being developed along with the MWO to support the vessels and the C4I/CEN operations will be validated and verified against upon completion of the fleet installation/upgrade process.   When finalized, the MWO will be used to develop a Scope of Work to support awarding a contracting effort to upgrade C4ISR/CEN equipment on the LCU fleet.  The contract is anticipated to include procurement and installation of the suite on the LCU fleet. IV.  Present Acquisition Requirements a. The Level 1 drawing(s), Technical Manuals, and Training Material developed from the prototype effort will be provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP) phase and the post award effort. This information will be part of the materials provided to any Offer or under this acquisition. b. At the present time funding is uncertain.  PM AWS is actively seeking program funds to modify all 31 vessels.  Funding will likely be spread over more than one fiscal year, and may never be adequate to modify the entire fleet.  We hope to secure a porti on of the necessary funding as early as FY06, however, no funding presently exists in our budget for this effort.   c.  The U.S. Armys LCU-2000s  are positioned in at least four (4) different locations worldwide.  The locations are Kuwait; Japan; Ft. Eustis, VA; and Mare Island, CA.  Note that Kuwait is considered a war zone.  Depending on the amount and timing/availab ility of funding allocated for this effort work could be required to be simultaneously executed at multiple locations, on multiple vessels. The present location of LCU-2000 vessels is subject to change and therefore exact quantities of vessels at each loca tion will not be provided with this request for information.  d. The C4ISR equipment, while not secret, is classified operational security (OPSEC) sensitive and requires special handling, storage, and clearance.  Employees handling any COMSEC sensitive equipment and/or material will need to have a verifiable secret c learance.  In addition, the contractors facility will require clearance prior to handling or performance of any effort relative to the COMSEC portion of the LCU 2000 C4ISR installation effort.    Securing Facility Clearance entails the completion of the C ontract Security Classification Specifications (DD Form 254) form, and a NSS facility review and approval.  The DD Form 254 is designed to provide security requirements and classification guidance needed for performance of a classified contract or one where handling of security sensitive equipment or data will be required.  The DD Form 254 will be annotated as t o the security requirements that the Contractor and any/all related subcontracts/subcontracts must adhere to for the immediate/specific contract.  e. Contractor personnel assigned to the LCU-2000 C4I/CEN installation effort shall be capable of handling and processing information, material, and equipment at the appropriate security level throughout this effort and shall be fully trained and competent in the use and operation of the C4I/CEN, having licenses for the tasks where licensing is required.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Extensograph
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Grain Marketing and Production Research Center, Manhattan, Kansas, intends to enter into a single source contract with C. W. Brabender Instruments, South Hackensack, New Jersey, for the purchase of an Extensograph E for measuring and recording the quality of wheat flours in terms of stretching behavior of the dough, baking characteristics, influence of flour additives and rheological optimum.  This equipment is used in several Federal and State research laboratories and commercial baking laboratories that test flour quality traits.  It is critical that results generated are well correlated with results from other dough rheology instruments such as a Government-owned Farinograph E, which is used to prepare the sample dough needed for the Extensograph E.  The physical dough test protocol for the extensograph method is AACC Method 54-10, which will be applicable in testing extensibility traits of wheat flour dough.  Dough extensibility data from the Extensograph is important in many wheat importing countries and the information will be used by wheat breeders in the development and release of new varieties that meet export demands.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business August 8, 2005, if interested in this procurement.

The main intent of this AOO is to find out if there are any interested Developers that would like to be involved in this opportunity at Hangar One. Hangar One is located at Moffett Field, California. The hangar was built in 1932 to house the U.S.S. Macon, a U.S Navy dirigible. Hangar One is a distinctive landmark of the San Francisco Bay Area. The hangar structure consists of steel truss arches, metallic sheathing and full clamshell doors. The hangar is 1,140 feet in length, 308 feet in width and 198 feet in height.  Hangar One is a designated federal historic property and is the principal historic property of the Shenandoah Plaza Historic District. The siding covering Hangar One is contaminated with hazardous materials, namely PCBs and asbestos, as well as lead paint. The U.S Navy is obligated to remediate the hazardous materials under orders from the EPA.  Assuming that the Navy elects to remove the contaminated exterior siding and leave the structural frame of the hangar (Exhibit B, Alternative 2-E), NASA intends to enter into an enhanced use lease or other legal instrument (not a procurement action) with a third party (for purposes of this AOO, a "Developer") to install a new Photovoltaic (PV) system that will generate a minimum of two megawatts of electricity along with the hangar's re-siding work at no cost to the Government. NASA WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY FUNDS FOR THE SIDING, PV SYSTEM, OR ITS INSTALLATION.  NASA’s contribution is to provide the use of the Hangar One’s outer surface area, with options to purchase delivered power, and the right to use the project for credentials, publications and advertising.  The document entitled “Proposed Photovoltaic Power System for Hanger One” dated July 25, 2005 is made up of 6 sections: Section I: Background Information; Section II: NASA Ames’s Goals and Objectives; Section III: Scope of Services; Section IV: Proposal Requirements; Section V: Site Visit and Proposal Submission; and Section VI: Exhibits.  The Exhibits are: Exhibit A – a US Department of Energy Federal Energy Management Program Technical Assistance Report; and Exhibit B – The Navy’s Proposed Alternatives. The anticipated schedule of events includes a Site Visit on September 6, 2005.  Developers with Expressions of Interest of this AOO should attend the Site Visit to be held on September 6, 2005 at 10:00 AM at the north end of Hangar One parking lot, Moffett Field, CA.  (Note:  A valid driver’s license or other photo identification is required to pass the guard station.)  If you plan to attend the site visit, send an email to Keith Venter at keith.venter@nasa.gov no later than September 1, 2005 with your intention to attend. The deadline for submitting questions on this AOO, to keith.venter@nasa.gov, is no later than 5:00 PM Pacific Time on September 13, 2005.  Questions and respective answers, and any necessary amendments to documentation will be posted on or around September 29, 2005.  The Deadline for submission of Proposals (see Section V of the July 25, 2005 document for specific requirements) is 5:00 PM Pacific Time on October 14, 2005.

<SUBJECT>B -- VFLO HYDROLOGIC LANDSLIDE PREDICTION MODULE
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL), proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Vieux & Associates, Inc. for Vflo Hydrologic model support services and the customization of a landslide prediction module in the existing Hydrologic Decision Support System (HDSS). This work is critical to the Joint NOAA/Taiwan technology transfer agreement collaboration.  The main goal for this procurement is for the development of a landslide prediction model within the Vflo model.  The proprietary Vflo model has been operational in Taiwan and is the required software infrastructure for the landslide module.  Development of a landslide model outside of Vflo would require an entirely new hydrologic model and would be cost prohibitive.  The landslide module within then Vflo model will require testing, configuration and coupling with existing Central Meteorological Bureau (CWB) infrastructure.  The proposed effort would focus on extending the Vflo model to include a landslide prediction component, training, calibration studies, display enhancements, test feasibility of the new landslide module. The real time model operation, distributed flood level criteria development, and operational implementation will be a shared responsibility between the CWB and Vieux & Associates.
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K). This synopsis is issued for information only. No competitive solicitation is planned. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Any questions regarding this notice shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is August 12, 2005.

<SUBJECT>B -- Prevalence Estimates
<DESC>Down syndrome (DS) is a serious birth defect that occurs in approximately 1out of every 800 live births in the United States.  DS is associated with mental retardation, congenital heart defects, dysmorphic facial features, hand anomalies, and defects of the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and the endocrine system. People with DS are also at an increased risk of leukemia and dementia. Survival with DS has improved over the years, with the median age at death increasing from 25 years of age in 1983 to 49 years of age in 1997.  The DS phenotype is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, which is the presence of additional chromosome 21 materials in addition to the normal set of chromosomes. The most common form of DS occurs when there is a complete extra copy of chromosome 21 (non-disjunction, 92% of US cases). The second most common form of DS occurs when part or all of chromosome 21 is translocated to another chromosome, usually chromosome 14 (3-4% of U.S. cases).  Individuals with the first two forms of DS are typically indistinguishable by phenotype. Mosaic Down syndrome, the least common form, occurs when a proportion of the cells in the body have the normal number of chromosomes, and the remaining cells have trisomy 21 (2-3% of U.S. cases).  Individuals with mosaic DS can have milder physical features associated with the birth defect than children with non-disjunction or translocation. Risk factors for DS include maternal age, history of a previous pregnancy affected by DS, and the translocation of parental chromosome 21. Recent birth prevalence estimates for DS have been reported by at least 35 states in the U.S.

The birth prevalence from 1997 through 2002 ranged from 10.63 per 10,000 live births in New York to 18.12 per 10,000 live births in Colorado. Spina bifida (SB) is a common birth defect that develops within the first 28 days after conception and results from the improper closure of the neural tube.  The more severe cases of SB are associated with physical, mental, and psychological difficulties. Early complications include problems with walking and coordination, urinary and bowel incontinence, and limb numbness and paralysis. Long-term complications and secondary conditions include scoliosis, seizures, shunt complications, urinary tract infections, latex allergies, skin ulcerations, obesity, a decreased growth rate, learning disabilities, and emotional problems. Survival to age 1 among infants born with SB in Atlanta has improved from 85.4% in 1979-1983 to 95.5% in 2000-2002.

The prevalence of SB has been decreasing in the United States and other regions of the world.  This decline in SB prevalence at birth could be due to fortification of foods with folic acid, increased multivitamin use during the periconceptional period of pregnancy, and an increased prenatal detection and termination of SB pregnancies. In some areas of the United States, approximately 20% to 30% of pregnancies affected by neural tube defects are electively terminated.  In 2000, the birth prevalence of SB without electively terminated.  In 2000, the birth prevalence of SB without anencephaly was approximately 2 out of every 10,000 live births in the U.S., and survival has improved through the years.   Recent birth prevalence estimates for SB have been reported by at least 35 states in the U.S.  The birth prevalence from 1997 through 2002 ranged from 1.85 per 10,000 live births in New Jersey to 6.03 per 10,000 live births in Iowa.

The primary purpose of this study is to provide prevalence estimates (by state and metro region) for Down syndrome (DS) and spina bifida (SB) among children and adolescents and to determine the survival probabilities and predictors of survival for these infants.  The National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities recently developed a methodology to estimate the prevalence of SB among children and adolescents in Atlanta using data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP) and from the U.S. Census.  Using regional birth defects surveillance data, these methods will be replicated in this study to estimate prevalence of children and adolescents with SB and DS (separately) in metropolitan Atlanta, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Iowa, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Utah. Case infants with DS or SB identified in each region will be divided into birth cohorts and brought forward in time to determine their survival in future time periods. Vital status will be ascertained using state vital records, case records from the state birth defects registries, and by linking to the National Death Index.  Prevalence estimates will be calculated by age, sex, race, heart defect (DS cases only) and lesion site (SB cases only).  For more recent years (i.e. 2000–2002), prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.  Survival analysis will include the estimation of survival probabilities by age and birth cohort, as well as overall survival by race, sex, birth weight, gestational age, plurality, apgar score, and pediatric hospital admission (when these variables are available from a given registry).  The predictors of survival will also be examined, and will include the previously described variables as well as mother’s and father’s education, and mother’s and father’s age.  The survival analysis will be conducted using methods similar to those previously used by the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD). 

All state birth defects registries were reviewed to determine: (1) if they had sufficient years of data; (2) surveillance methods that could provide necessary level case ascertainment; and (3) administrative support to complete the work.  Birth defect surveillance programs were not considered if they could not provide case ascertainment through population-based active surveillance process or through a passive system with confirmed diagnoses or if they could not provide down syndrome and spina bifida case data from at least 1995 through 2002.  The following state birth defect surveillance programs meet all requirements necessary to contribute to a study that will investigate the prevalence of down syndrome in the population through adolescence: Iowa, Oklahoma, New York, Colorado, North Carolina, Utah, Texas, Arkansas, and California. Thus, CDC intends to issue multiple awards on the basis of sole source to the following organizations, which were found to have the required surveillance methods to supply mortality data with sufficient years of follow up to contribute to this study: (1)  The University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Dr., Iowa City, IA 52242; (2) Oklahoma State Department of Health, Oklahoma City, OK 73117; (3) Health Research, Inc., New York State (4) Department of Health, One University Place, Resselaer, NY 12144; (5) Colorado Department of Health and Environment, 4300 Cherry Creek Dr., Denver, CO 80246; (5) State Center for Health Statistics; Division of Publish Health, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services; (7) Utah State Department of Health, Salt Lace City, UT 84114-4699; (8)Department of State Health Services, 1100 W. 49th St., Austin, TX 78756; (9)Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute,1120 Marshall St., Little Rock, AR  72202; March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, 1615 Fifth Street, First Floor, Davis, CA  95616.

<SUBJECT>D -- NOAA Site License for COTS IDL software
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(NOAA)  intends to negotiate a single source contract with the Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, Colorado under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.   This contract will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, through Federal Acquisition Circular(FAC) 2005-4.  The purpose of this contract is to purchase COTS IDL software for site licensing, data analysis, visualization and cross-platform application development, and maintenance thereof.  Transition away from the IDL software to another visualization software tool is impractical given the number of lines of already existing NOAA code and high costs associated with an alternative.  The NOAA has approximately 1500 installations of the COTS IDL software that is currently used by approximately 1000 research and support personnel. A substantial investment, estimated to be $1 million, has been made to train NOAA personnel to use the IDL software. The Research Systems, Incorporated is the direct supplier of this software and does not use resellers in the U.S.  For the above reasons it would be untimely and too costly for any other firm to provide the services of this requirement.  A three(3) year contract is planned.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. Reference number: NEEA7000-5-00080mac.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers’ Day Workshop for Application Communities
<DESC>PROPOSERS’ DAY ANNOUNCEMENT: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) announces the Proposers’ Day for Application Communities (AC). The goals of this Proposers’ Day Workshop are to discuss the objectives of this anticipated effort, provide technical discussion on the topics of interest to the program, promote discussion between industry and government, foster teaming among potential proposers, and answer questions. 

DoD computing systems are highly reliant on Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) software applications. Unfortunately, COTS applications are frequently vulnerable to security compromise and service disruption due to bugs, configuration errors, and operator errors.  Such security and reliability failures pose a serious threat to the operational capabilities of military forces.  This threat is exacerbated by the fact that DoD systems are frequently comprised of numerous copies of a small chosen set of COTS applications; these copies are vulnerable to the same problems and therefore to failing simultaneously or sequentially at the command of a skilled attacker. Such software homogeneity has strong manageability advantages, but the risk of catastrophic failure, or software blight, dramatically reduces the trust that should be placed in such systems wherever there is a channel through which malicious code or commands can be introduced.  Significant research has focused on introducing software diversity to limit the impact of single flaws. Diversity appears to be a promising avenue for addressing common mode vulnerabilities, but it will likely increase management costs, and will probably have performance implications as well.  An alternative is to augment applications to cooperate so different copies of an application collaboratively reason about their shared attributes to diagnose, protect, and monitor one another.

The AC program seeks to develop a software execution infrastructure for existing COTS programs.  This infrastructure will monitor and augment COTS application behavior so multiple active copies of an application X running under the infrastructure behave as a self-aware Application-X-Community that: 1) collaboratively diagnoses problems (attacks/bugs/errors), 2) collaboratively responds to problems by generating appropriate configuration changes, patches, filters, etc., and 3) collaboratively generates a community-specific situation awareness gauge that predicts likelihood and timing of imminent problems.  In lieu of providing program success metrics up front, the AC program will request that AC researchers propose success metrics and the resources and time needed to achieve them, where the proposed metrics, if achieved, would justify commercial investment in products and services.  The AC program seeks a small number of teams where each team covers all the technical areas and includes an integrator that can bring the resulting technology to market if the research is successful.  The program will test the hypothesis that a collaborative reliability and defense system for black-box COTS applications can be made mostly automatic and that application communities encompassing a greater diversity of users and environments are more resilient in the face of unanticipated errors and attacks.

The overarching goal of the AC program is to develop practical technology for on-line, mostly automatic, flaw and attack remediation for heavily-deployed black-box COTS applications.  The AC program focuses on the scenario in which an application is used simultaneously by a variety of users and in a variety of settings.  This program seeks to determine the extent to which diverse field data from these different users and settings can be combined with techniques such as static binary analysis, model checking, formal specifications, binary instrumentation, correlation, and historical information to characterize an application’s intended behavior, diagnose problems, block problems or attack recurrence, restart failed copies into safe states, and monitor health.

The Application Communities Proposers’ Day workshop will be held at the Hyatt Arlington, 1325 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA  22209, on August 16, 2005, beginning at 9:00 am and ending at 4:30 pm, to be followed by a reception from 4:30 pm to 6:00 pm. Registration will begin at 8:00 am. The workshop will present an overview of Application Communities, and include invited presentations, poster session, discussions, and Q&A. If interested in attending please visit the registration website at https://www.schafertmd.com/acp2005/ .  Attendees must be registered on the site by August 8, 2005 to attend the workshop. Due to space limitations, each organization is limited to three people. Workshop attendees must be U.S. Citizens. Attendance at the Proposers' Day is voluntary. Attendance is not required to propose to subsequent Broad Agency Announcements or research solicitations on this topic. It is anticipated that the cost for workshop attendance will be approximately $90 per attendee. DARPA will not provide cost reimbursement for workshop attendance. 

Workshop participants are invited to present in areas of technical competence related to Application Communities for purposes of technical discussion and teaming. Areas of technical competence for this program may include in no particular order: program analysis, anomaly detection, access control, software wrappers, virtual execution environments, software dynamic translation, program rewriting, formal modeling, peer-to-peer networking, anonymity, fault tolerance, intrusion tolerance, distributed processing, and information flow analysis, among others. Due to limited time, presenters will be selected from submitted abstracts for 10-minute time slots, including set-up and break-down. Abstracts must be received by August 3, 2005 and are limited to 250 words. All submitted abstracts will be provided to workshop attendees. If you wish to submit an abstract for presentation consideration, please inform John Frank by e-mail at Application.Communities@darpa.mil 

Additionally, there will be a poster session during the workshop. Attendees who wish to prepare posters must note this on the registration site.  Program information from the Application Communities Proposers' Day may be posted to the website: http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicit/AC/index.htm after the workshop. 

All materials submitted to and presented at the Application Communities Proposers Day Workshop must be approved in advance by both the organization that funded the research and the DARPA Program Manager. The DARPA Program Manager will screen the material for sensitive, but unclassified material. For this reason, any material you wish to present at the workshop, including presentations and posters, must be received no later than August 12, 2005 in order to receive consideration. It is the presenters’ responsibility to ensure the material has been approved for public release by the organization that funded the research. Written confirmation of this approval is requested when the material is submitted for the Program Manager’s review.

<SUBJECT>--Install Vindicator Annunciator as the single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) annunciator platform for all PACAF Installations
<DESC>Since the terrorist attacks on 11 Sep 01, operational requirements for Command and Control Infrastructure have grown by leaps and bounds.  The communications community has seen a tremendous surge in the number of Users requiring access to classified networks and classified systems, including the Global Command and Control System (GCCS), which supports various operations for Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  The growth of these classified infrastructure requirements forced the need for new and revised r egulations/instructions pertaining to physical security and the safeguarding of information.  As a result, PACAF/SC (Communication & Information) has begun to install physical intrusion detection systems (IDS) to support the physical security component of its classified systems.  In conjunction with the increased requirements for IDS, PACAF/SF (Security Force) has partnered with PACAF/SC in a joint initiative to standardize the IDS across the PACAF AOR.  This joint effort includes the installation of a new annunciator at the Security Forces Control Center at all PACAF Installations.  PACAF/SC is installing the Vindicator annunciator systems as part of its C2 modernization project to achieve PACAFs goal of standardization on a single annunciator platform.  C urrently, Hickam AFB has completed the installation of the Vindicator annunciator panel at its Security Forces Control Center.   Current and future projects being constructed under the AF MILCON program will have to comply with this requirement and provide  the Vindicator system for the IDS.

<SUBJECT>GLOBAL COMBAT SUPPORT SYSTEM - AIR FORCE (GCSS-AF)
<DESC>This is a formal announcement of a contract extension and Contractor Industry Day.  The Air Force's Operations Support Systems Wing intends to extend the ordering period for Engineering Services line items for the Global Combat Support System -Air Force (GCSS-AF) contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Integrated Systems and Solutions, 1701 North Street, Mail Drop 257-4A, Endicott, NY 13760, for a period of NTE 24 months to allow for completion of the ongoing development of the GCSS-AF Integration Framework.  This extension will not increase or otherwise add to the types of work included in the original competed solicitation, increase the competed contract dollar ceiling, nor extend the overall term of the GCSS-AF contract, as originally competed.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302. <br><br> Lockheed Martin is currently developing, delivering, and operating one of the largest net-centric, standards-based Service Oriented Architectures in the federal government.  The program requires additional time to complete post IOC development and developmental testing to achieve Full Operational Capability (FOC).  Also, the extension is sought to account for anticipated funding challenges, provide a brief period for system stabilization, and incorporate the lessons learned from the initial ERP deployments onto GCSS-AF into a follow-on GCSS-AF approach.  Due to the complexity of the GCSS-AF architecture, Air Force dependence on the more than 150 warfighter services/capabilities in operation on GCSS-AF today, and the more than 400,000 active member uses per week; competition and potential transition to a new contractor prior to FOC would result in an unacceptable delay, increased risk, and increased cost to the Government.  Although the extension is for 24 months, the AF desires to award the follow-on contract in the 18- to 21-month range to provide an overlapping period to ensure a graceful transition to sustainment of the GCSS-AF capabilities. <br><br> Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within the next 15 days.  If there is interest in this action, the next step is to  submit a proposal. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all proposals received within 45 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Air Force. A determination by the Government not to compete this contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the Government's discretion. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541512. Indicate in your response whether you are a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, (8)a concern, woman-owned small business, HUB-zone small business, veteran owned small business, or service disabled veteran owned small business. Also, specify in your response whether you are a U.S. owned or foreign owned firm. Responses can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Veronica Spight, 200 East Moore Drive, Bldg 888, Room 2051, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114 or you may submit a fax response to (334) 416-4805.  You may also e-mail Ms. Spight at veronica.spight@gunter.af.mil or contact her at (334) 416-4802. <br><br> As a separate but complementary action, the AF will be hosting a GCSS-AF Industry Day on 11 August 2005, 1400-1600, AF Senior NCO Academy, West Auditorium, 550 McDonald Street, Maxwell AFB- Gunter Annex, AL 36114.  The purpose of the Industry Day is to share the detailed status of the GCSS-AF Program and the AF's expectations for the GCSS-AF follow-on acquisition. Interested vendors should register by submitting their names, telephone numbers, and company address of those attending.  You may e-mail this information to Ms. Jane Schwartz at jane.schwartz@gunter.af.mil NLT COB 10 August 2005.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a Wavelength Dispersive Spectrometer to be attached to a Carl Zeiss SMT (formerly "LEO Electron Microscopy") Supra-50VP scanning electron microscope (SEM).  The WDS will be used in conjunction with the SEM and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS) to support various failure analysis, quality assurance, and product development tasks. The WDS system will be used to complement the EDS system by providing superior energy resolution and superior sensitivity in order to resolve peak overlaps and to provide quantitative composition analysis.  The "working distance" of the WDS--the distance from the SEM final lens to position along the electron beam axis where the acquired x-ray signal is at maximum intensity--should coincide with the 8.5mm working distance of the current EDS system so that specimens need not be moved to use both WDS and EDS systems.   The types of samples to be analyzed vary widely, as do the purposes of the analyses.  The samples will include aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium alloys; multilayer microelecromechanical systems (MEMS) devices; and others. Analysis tasks will include identifying contaminants, verifying materal compositions, mapping multi-phase materials, and others.  The WDS system must therefore exhibit flexibility, ease of use, and broad spectral coverage. Physical Specifications: 1. The WDS System shall be capable of being mounted to the 5-in by 7-in (approximate) WDS port on the existing Supra-50VP scanning electron microscope. 2. The preferred working distance of the mounted WDS is 8.5mm. The working distance of the mounted WDS shall be no less than 8.5mm. The working distance of the mounted WDS shall be no more than 13mm. 3. The WDS system shall be sealed such that it will withstand an SEM sample chamber pressure of 1 x 10-7 torr without leakage. 4. The WDS system shall not impose any mechanical vibration at the SEM interface when the WDS system is not in operation. 5. The WDS system shall not cause any physical interference with the specimen stage or detectors present in the SEM chamber. 6. The WDS system shall not cause any interference with the SEM or energy dispersive spectrometer system when the WDS system is not in operation. The WDS system may assume control of SEM functions as required during spectrum acquisition or x-ray map acquisition.  Performance Specifications: 7. The WDS system shall be capable of detecting x-rays in the range 0.18 keV to 10 keV, with continuous coverage over the specified range. 8. The WDS system shall be capable of acquiring spectra with a nominal 300 pA electron beam impinging on the sample. 9. The WDS system shall utilize the diffraction of x-rays by crystal or layered targets to achieve wavelength dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. 10. The selection of the diffracting crystal(s) appropriate to a given energy range shall be performed by the WDS system. 11. Switching of diffracting crystals, when required, shall be performed by the WDS system. System Tools: 12. The WDS system shall be capable of acquiring an x-ray spectrum over a user-selected energy range within the range specified above. 13. The WDS system shall display acquired spectra with intensity and energy axes. 14. Acquired spectra shall be scalable in both the intensity and energy axes. 15. The WDS system shall be capable of displaying the theoretical peak positions of the x-ray emissions of all detectable elements in the spectral range. 16. The WDS system shall allow the labeling of x-ray lines selected by the user. 17. The WDS system shall store or export spectra in a standard file type (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, et al.) for inclusion in electronic documents. 18. The WDS system shall be capable of performing quantitative analysis. 19. The WDS system shall be capable of communicating with the SEM in order to determine the magnification, accelerating voltage, and beam current condition. 20. The WDS system shall be capable of digital x-ray mapping for a minimum of 5 selected elements in addition to a captured secondary electron image.  General Requirements: 21. The contracted cost of the system shall include on-site installation of the equipment at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. 22. The contracted cost of the system shall include a one-year warranty on all parts and services or a one-year comprehensive service and maintenance agreement, the one-year period to begin on the date of acceptance.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quotes (RFQ) number is NRMAP000500176MAS. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. This notice is being published on an unrestricted basis. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) has a requirement for a Gas Filter carbon monoxide (CO) Analyzer. CMDL makes continuous high-precision measurements of CO for use in studies of the global carbon cycle and air quality and their network of measurement sites are expanding, and they need to install several new systems this year. These sites will be primarily located in rural areas rather than polluted urban areas. CMDL therefore requires an analyzer that is optimized to detect background levels of CO. The analyzer shall be compatible with their existing sampling system design and data acquisition hardware. A scientist or technician will visit the field site once per week to perform routine maintenance. However, not all of the scientists/technicians will have highly technical backgrounds, so any routine maintenance procedures shall be simple. The unit shall require high precision, better than 0.010 ppm when averaged over 15 minutes (better than 0.055 ppm when averaged over 30 sec) and low detection limits (0.040 ppm or better).Time response shall be 60 sec or better. The range of the analyzer shall be set for background CO monitoring with an upper limit of 2 ppm. Linearity shall be 1% or better over the sampling range. The instrument response shall be stable: zero drift shall be less 5 ppb per hour, and span drift shall be less than 0.05% per hour. The analyzer shall be able to accommodate a flow rate of 0.8 to 1 slm. The analyzer shall run off of 115V/60Hz power and shall fit in a standard 19” rack (23”deep). Height shall be less than 9”.There shall be enough room to install a flow controller and a pressure controller on the same level of the rack as the CO analyzer either outside or inside of the CO analyzer box. This requires a volume of 7”h x 9”l  x 4”w.The analyzer shall weigh less than 50 lbs as it will be installed near the top of the rack. Both analog and RS-232 outputs shall be available. The analyzer shall be capable of operating at 40 deg C.

           of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this
           contract.

        by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that
        Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information
        within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
        paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

A: There is a schedule established, and the contractor’s will be a part of this schedule

2. Will pagers or cell phones be provided?
No. Contractors are expected to have their own cell phones.

4. How many interpreters resumes do you intend to receive in the RFQ? Please send the most qualified and those who are available. Any resume we receive, we will assume the person is considered “key” and therefore available.

5. Is this a new requirement or is there an incumbent?
There is an incumbent.

 6. American Sign Language is the requirement that you have; will there be any need for someone who is fluent in both ASL and ESL?  
This has not been identified as an immediate need.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission team to identify and analyze airport and marine port security project opportunities in Nigeria and assess the need for additional USTDA support for technical assistance and training.  The mission will also review Nigeria’s privatization plan for its port operations, provide an analysis of potential trade and investment opportunities that might result from privatization, and identify potential U.S. investors should the plan to privatize move forward.  Additionally, this mission will also follow up with the Nigerian Ports Authority on the status of projects recommended in a Definitional Mission for port sector projects in Nigeria completed in 2003.

The selected DM consultant will be expected to travel to Nigeria in the fall of 2005.  While in Nigeria, the DM consultant will meet with the Nigerian Ports Authority, the Nigerian Customs Service, and the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, as well as other Nigerian governmental entities, parastatals, and/or Nigerian or international private operators the DM consultant and COTR deem appropriate.  

Marine Port Security

Cargo inspection delays at port facilities in Nigeria are notoriously long and are a serious constraint to trade and economic development.  The Nigerian Ports Authority is seeking ways to improve port security in a way that will allow the Nigerian Customs Service to effectively keep pace with increasing trade flows.

The Nigerian Government recently imposed and is generally trying to enforce a rule requiring 100 percent of the goods to be inspected by customs at destination (versus pre-inspection).  Besides further delaying the transport of goods, this rule is believed to have led to increased corruption at the ports.  As part of the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), Nigeria has embarked on a major reorganization of its customs agency to increase efficiency and eliminate corruption.  

Congestion at ports has also made vessels waiting to dock vulnerable to piracy, which in turn has raised insurance premiums for carriers and pushed up shipping costs and therefore the costs of goods.

The DM Contractor will be expected to have the expertise to analyze marine port security projects.

Airport Security

USTDA met with the Director of Airport Operations for the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) during a recent trip to Nigeria.  During this meeting, FAAN discussed the possible need for airport security technical assistance.  Nigerian aviation officials are seeking ways to more comprehensively address airport security deficiencies and make necessary procurements.

The DM Contractor will be expected to have the expertise to analyze airport security projects.

Privatization of Marine Ports

Nigeria is undergoing substantial public sector reform, and is currently considering plans to privatize port operations.  The Government of Nigeria, as part of its plan to rehabilitate and improve operations at the nation’s ports to ease congestion and to ensure the ports are in line with international security requirements, plans to open up port operations through private concessioning.  An analysis of the privatization plan would identify a number of potential port development projects that would address the non-customs related congestion.


The DM Contractor will be expected to have the expertise to analyze port sector privatization plans. 
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.
