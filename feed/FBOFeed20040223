<DESC>Licensing of ORNL’s lightweight, portable sensor for the identification of chemical-biological species

UT-Battelle LLC (UT-Battelle), the management and operating contractor for the United States Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is seeking expressions of interest from companies interested in licensing and commercializing ORNL’s intellectual property in the technology area of high-sensitivity Raman spectroscopy for the identification of chemical-biological species.

ORNL’s Advanced Biomedical Science and Technology Group has developed a lightweight, portable sensor for the identification of chemical-biological species, including explosives, toxic chemicals, and drugs. (nicknamed RAMiTS - RAMan Integrated Tunable Sensor.)

This instrument is based upon high-sensitivity Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique that can measure the vibrational signature of most chemicals, both solids and liquids. To obtain this chemical signature, laser light is focused onto the sample, and the resulting scattered light is collected and detected. Using this instrument for chemical and biological sample identification has several advantages over conventional analysis, including these:

The user need not contact the sample.
Analysis is rapid, in most cases 11 seconds or less.
An embedded computer system performs rapid automated sample identification.
User interaction with the system is via a touch screen.
RAMiTS operates on battery power, with a single-charge lifetime of 3 hours.
The instrument is watertight and can be decontaminated after exposure to CBW agents.

The technology transfer process will be facilitated through appropriate licensing of UT-Battelle’s intellectual property and associated research and development undertaken cooperatively between UT-Battelle and the licensee and funded by the licensee.  Research and development will focus on transitioning the technology from the current laboratory demonstration stage to commercialization.  Interested companies with experience and expertise commensurate with the requirements of this commercialization effort are invited to respond to this announcement.  Companies interested in this opportunity may obtain more detailed technical information and a description of the licensing and cooperative research and development process by submitting a statement of interest, including a written description of their company and its activities and an explanation of their potential application of the technology.  No licensing intermediaries please.  This is not a procurement activity.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for a formal proposal. This synopsis seeks to identify the interest from potential contractors for the “Development of Enrichment and Selective Culture Media for the Isolation of Special Pathogens from High Priority Foods.” Recent events have reinforced the importance of FDA’s long-standing interest in the development of improved methods for the identification of potential threat agents in foods.  CFSAN maintains an active research program for developing and enhancing methodologies to detect and identify microbial hazards that may contaminate food and food products either naturally or through deliberate contamination.  Standard protocols for isolation of the most commonly occurring pathogens have been developed.  Traditionally, these protocols rely on enrichment and selective culture media for the isolation of a pathogen from the food.  CFSAN needs to further enhance its detection and identification capabilities with respect to pathogens that are not typically considered to be foodborne pathogens.  Specifically, there is a need to develop bacterial growth media that will improve the recovery of these atypical pathogens from priority food matrices.  Initial efforts will focus specifically in the detection of Brucella and Burkholderia species associated with human disease. 

Statement of Work

The contract shall include preliminary assessment of growth and isolation characteristics of pure culture isolates in media from commercial or other sources.  Furthermore, selected media preparations which have been found to hold the greatest promise for fulfillment of the goals will be evaluated for use with representative food matrix categories of interest.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work. 
The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement.  All services shall be provided in a timely manner to help ensure that CFSAN can fulfill its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents.

	Task 1

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Brucella abortus, melitensis, and suis (Brucella spp.).  These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

	The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Brucella spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

	Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp. species from food.

	Task 2

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei (Burkholderia spp).   These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Burkholderia spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp. from food.

Security Issues

	All personnel involved in the performance of this task order shall have a secret or higher security clearance.  The clearance shall be obtained prior to commencement of any work.  Performance of this task order shall be conducted in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  The manual can be accessed at the following web site:   <http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm>.  

The offeror shall provide proof of a certified BSL-3 laboratory and trained personnel for work on the project.


It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID, IQ multi-year contract with task orders.   Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.   Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research is will be necessary to classify some of these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the necessary security clearances.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will only be available on the FedBizOpps web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.   Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of the solicitation and amendments.  The RFP should be available for downloading on/about fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement and proposals will be due 30 days after issue of the RFP.  The FDA reserves the right to award without discussions.  Technical questions should be sent to the Contracting Officers e-mail address or fax number contained herein.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541710.

<DESC>Dear Interested Parties:

REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST – INTEGRATED DISPOSAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

CH2M Hill Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) as a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy is seeking qualified small businesses for construction activities on the Integrated Disposal Facility (IDF) project, located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford site. 
The IDF project consists of a single RCRA Subtitle C landfill, with two lined cells.  The IDF construction work includes large-scale excavation and grading, soil and geosynthetic liner installation, and a leachate handling system.  The landfill excavation is approximately 1.2 million cubic yards.  The liner system includes an admix soil layer consisting of native soil mixed with bentonite (approximately 85,000 cubic yards), geosynthetic layers (1.5 million square feet HDPE geomembrane, 2.3 million square feet combined total area for composite drainage net, geotextile and GCL installation), a drainage gravel layer, and an operations cover layer.  The leachate handling system includes pumps, approximately 3,000 feet of double contained HDPE pipe, four small metal buildings, two concrete slabs on grade, and two leachate storage tanks with double flexible liner containment systems.
CH2M HILL is seeking small businesses that have prior working experience in heavy civil engineering construction including construction of double HDPE lined landfills with bentonite processed clay barriers.  To be considered a small business, firms must have 500 or fewer employees.
Interested firms are invited to submit an expression of interest letter to include a response to the following: 
1.	A statement that confirms the firm’s ability to meet the small business criteria established above. A statement that indicates the firm’s bonding capability.
2.	A description of the firm’s Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (QA/QC) program and provide project on which that QA/QC program was used.  This work will be performed under Washington Administrative Code (WAC 173-303-335) independent construction quality assurance (CQA) oversight program.  Please detail landfill construction projects the firm has worked on in the past with an independent CQA oversight program.  
3.	A description of the firm’s record of performing construction services similar in size, content, and complexity to the requirements of this solicitation. Specific emphasis should be placed on previous projects over the past five years that involved construction of double HDPE lined landfills with bentonite processed clay barriers.  Information provided shall include: 
•	Documented construction production rates (cubic yards per week) achieved for similar past projects for large-scale excavation and placement of admix liner (include description of admix processing method).  
•	Identify HDPE geomembrane manufactures and HDPE geomembrane installers used and the total area of geomembrane material installed from past projects. 
•	Provide an Owner contact from past double HDPE lined landfill projects that the firm has completed.

This is not a Request for Proposal, but a request for an expression of interest.  Expression of interest letters must be received via email at Thomas_J_Parkes@rl.gov or by fax at (509) 373-2551 no later than March 8, 2004.  
Responses to this letter will be evaluated as part of the pre-qualification process for procurement of this work.

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d) 	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                              ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                                                     ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                                                           ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                                                         ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h) 	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
52-412-04-03 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
52-512-04-03 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The Program Executive Office, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. is soliciting new and innovative concepts that are integrated and aligned with our ASW Concept of Operations and which offer the potential to fundamentally change the way Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) is conducted by the U.S. Navy.  The Navy is interested in technologies that will dramatically improve curr ent and future operational ASW capabilities. The Operational Vision for future ASW missions is discussed in the Naval Transformational Roadmap.  Within this Roadmap, ASW mission areas fall under the Littoral Sea Control component of the Sea Shield Operational Concept as enabled by FORCEnet, an envisioned architecture of sensors, networks, decision aids, weapons and supporting systems integrated into a single comprehensive maritime network. ASW is considered essential to assuring access and asserting maritime superiority in forward operating areas. Information on the order of battle and specific mission areas in which ASW capabilities will be required was provided at a Pre-solicitation Conference on 23 January 2004 in Washington D.C.  A SECRET CD-ROM containing the releasable information presented at the Pre-solicitation Conference is available upon request to those organizat ions that provide the necessary security information to enable PEO IWS to verify facility clearances.  Requests may be sent to A.Sabella@stanleyassociates.com. The Navy’s primary objective in this solicitation is to acquire readily transferable technologies that will reduce the Observe, Orient, Decide, Attack (OODA) Loop and reduce risk to manned platforms and forces due to Threat Submarine operations. The Navy’s ASW Investment Strategy for the near and mid-term is based on improving capabilities in the following areas; Battle-space Preparations, Target Detection, Target Engagement and Platform Self-Protection.  The Navy is most interested in new and innovative (breakthrough) concepts that can be rapidly employed in  U.S. Navy ASW Concept Of Operations (CONOPS).  Of secondary interest are concepts that require extensive exploration or those standalone technologies that pr ovide enhancement to our existing ASW capabilities. The scope of this BAA will include three Phases; your proposal should address each Phase. The scope of Phase 1 should be to develop the proposed concept in a manner that allows Navy Subject Matter Experts to cooperatively evaluate its feasibility.  The scope of Phase 2 should be to conduct a shore-based feasibility demonstration to convince Navy Subject Matter Experts that the proposed concept can work.   The scope of Phase 3 should be to conduct a “Limited Objectives” at-sea experiment of the proposed concept. This BAA will be open through 30 September 2004.  Proposals may be submitted any time within that period.  Contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and "other transactions," as appropriate, will be limited by funding availability. .  Therefore, early submission of proposals is desirable and encouraged.  The Navy  desires to begin making awards by May 2004. Contractors may submit study proposals.  Studies, if proposed, should identify innovative solutions, technologies, cost drivers, and development approaches suitable for demonstration within 12 months from award.  Study proposals must be limited to no more than 10 pages.  Detailed technical references available in the public domain, for example, technical journals, Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), publicly available web sites etc., should be listed in an appropriate bibliography. No award can be made without a proposal to perform a specific effort within an estimated cost and time period.  Industry, Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, educational institutions, Historically Black Colleges and University and Minority Institutions are encouraged to participate. Proposals should be submitted to the Cognizant  Contracting Activity whose address is: Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, ATTN: Code 0263, James Watts 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue, S.E. Washington Navy Yard Washington, DC 20376 Contracting Point-of-Contact is James Watts, telephone (202)781-3958, e-mail wattsjr@navsea.navy.mil .

<DESC>NAVICP-Mechanicsburg plans to award a fixed price award fee/cost plus award fee requirements contract that provides the establishment and operation of a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) program with RAYTHEON Co. for various sole source Raytheon manufactured weapon systems.   The contract will be a five-year base with five two-year ceiling priced options.  This contract will result from streamlined PBL processing between the Navy and Raytheon that would leverage heavily on standardization of terms and conditions for all systems to reduce administrative lead-time/cycle time, process variation(s) and cost.  RAYTHEON shall function as the Government’s Commercial Stock Point for these spares including the performance of all routine inventory management functions including receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling in addition to performance of other ILS elem ents as required. Following evaluation and award of this contract, individual delivery orders will be executed for the specific tasks required for the weapon system from the menu of logistic elements.  The period of performance may vary per system depending on the length of intended Navy support/phase out.  Besides Navy, other potential customers for individual systems may include Coast Guard, US Marines, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers with or without cooperative logistic supply support agreements (CLSSAs). It is anticipated that the first delivery orders will include the specific PBL requirements of the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Program, Block 1, (AN/USG-2 and AN/USG-3 (airborne version), the AEGIS combat weapon system and the combined Phalanx/Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM)/SEARAM systems.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) plans to solicit proposals qualified organizations having in-house capability to perform in vivo rodent behavioral pharmacology studies of potential pharmacotherapies for the cognitive impairment seen in methamphetamine dependence.  In brief, the objectives of this project are: (1) To establish and validate animal model(s) of the cognitive impairment experienced by methamphetamine use; (2) To evaluate compounds for their potential ability to treat methamphetamine-induced cognitive deficits; (3) To evaluate compounds for their potential to exacerbate methamphetamine-induced cognitive deficits; and, (4) To evaluate the potential of compounds to produce methamphetamine-like effects on cognition. The offeror must propose the models to be developed and utilized for compound testing. The identity of proprietary test compounds will be blinded, and the resulting data will be utilized by the NIDA Medications Development Program.  In order to handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, it is mandatory that offerors possess a DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V and demonstrate the capability to obtain a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances.  All offerors must comply with NIH guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals.  We anticipate the award of one cost reimbursement contract for a base period of three years.  The contract will include two 1-year options as well as additional quantity options.  RFP No. N01DA-4-8849 will be available electronically on or about March 9, 2004.  You will access the RFP through the FedBizOpps (URL: http://www.fedbizopps.gov) or through the NIDA website: (URL: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html).

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY—IDIQ--CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS.  AN AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ONE 8A OR ONE HUBZONE ELIGIBLE CONCERN, IF THEIR PROPOSAL IS EVALUATED AS BEING ACCEPTABLE.  IF MORE THAN ONE 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR RECEIVES AN OVERALL RATING OF ACCEPTABLE, THE ONE 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR WITH THE HIGHEST RATING WILL RECEIVE THE AWARD.   The NAICS Code for this Solicitation is 236220: Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects: alterations, renovations, repairs, demolition and minor construction for activities in the area of operation for Resident Officer in Charge of Construction—ROICC-- Beaufort, SC, including, but not limited to, the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, SC; Marine Corps Reserve Center, Beaufort, SC; Naval Hospital, Beaufort, SC; and Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, SC.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Request for Proposal—RFP-- procedure that results in awards based on Best Value to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract will be for a term of five years: one base year with four, one-year options.  The anticipated workload is $5 to $10 million per contract over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $30,000,000.  Projects will vary in size from approximately $100,000 to $3,000,000 with the average project in the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range. The four successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders.  These can include 100% Plans and Specifications.  Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract. Participation in the pre-proposal conference or site visits for future task orders will be the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Proposers will be evaluated on factors that include:  FACTOR A: Past Performance, FACTOR B: Small Business Subcontracting Effort, FACTOR C: Technical Qualifications, and FACTOR D: Management Approach.  The total five-year factors relate to the five-year IDIQ contract requirements for general building construction, not just the seed project identified in this synopsis.   Task Orders may require multi-disciplined construction services in all aspects of general building construction for renovation, alterations, repairs, demolition and minor construction projects involving lead and asbestos abatement.   Projects will also require incorporation of sustainable design features.  Price proposals may include the total cost, evaluation of scope options within the Government’s published budget for award.  The best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the project and an IDIQ contract for the five-year term.  This initial seed project will satisfy consideration for a minimum guarantee.   A minimum guarantee of $25,000 will be consideration for the award of the second, third and fourth IDIQ contracts.  One contract award will be made to an 8A or one HUBZone eligible concern, if their proposal is evaluated as being acceptable.    If more than one 8A or HUBZone contractor receives an overall rating of acceptable, the one 8A or one HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award.  After award of the initial contracts, successful contractors will compete for task orders based on either best value using the trade off process or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.   The task order statements of work will be written based on a Government/Contractor team cooperative scoping of work.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposers submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be most advantageous to Government.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  Proposers should not assume they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The seed project for this solicitation is Consolidated Hazmat Admin Conversion Building 429, Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, SC.  This project consists of the following: a. Retrofitting the existing water supply pump house Building No. 429 at the Marine Corps Air Station, Beaufort, SC into offices to become the new administration building serving the Hazardous Material Warehouse;  b.

<RESPDATE>030904
<ARCHDATE>04082004
<CONTACT>TAMMY A. ADAMS, Contract Specialist, Phone: (513) 487-2030, E-Mail: adams.tammy@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is seeking to procure a Road Speed Modulated Fan (RSMF) System. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for vehicles and engines.  The supplemental Federal Test Procedure is an example of a test that requires special emission measurement systems.  The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems.  As part of this program, EPA has a requirement for a RSMF.  For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include all phases of the project - configuration, design, fabrication, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL (located in Ann Arbor, MI), installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation, and training of EPA staff. As part of the laboratory road simulation, a cooling fan is required that approximates the airflow delivered to a part of the vehicle frontal area and to the undercarriage as if it were driven on the road.  These vehicles may include those powered by some combination of internal combustion engines, electric motors and storage devices, hydraulics and hydraulic storage systems and fuel cells.  Some vehicles may be small and low to the ground, and others may be larger with higher ground clearances. The contractor shall supply a RSMF with the following general features: A fan design and delivery system that provides an accurate, uniform, and responsive road speed proportional air flow profile, utilizing a control technology that keeps the air flow plane closely synchronous with the vehicle (dyno roll) speed throughout the test.  A simple and reliable interface for the test operator to set up the fan and to verify its proper operation.  Air velocity measurements and data logging capabilities to verify performance on transient driving schedules shall be provided.  The capability to deliver air speeds and volumes for all light duty passenger vehicles, and medium-duty vehicles up to 14,000 GVW. Testing shall be accomplished by simulating the road speed proportional air flow profile measured at 1 foot in front of the vehicle at various road speeds.  With the induction of additional free air, the fan may actually be placed farther away to facilitate the uniform profile.  The ability to operate under various ambient conditions to provide maximum flexibility and ease of operation.  The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance in a manner suitable for audit to ISO standards.   Also included in the procurement is an option for an Extended Warranty and Preventative Maintenance Contract, that can be renewed annually for up to 2 years from the date of acceptance.  This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and will be competed using Full and Open Competition.  The solicitation should be issued around March 8, 2004 on the EPA website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested parties may submit a written request to receive the Request for Proposal to Tammy Adams via e-mail at adams.tammy@epa.gov or by fax at (513) 487-2107.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California intends to extend the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, for a period of two months, commencing 1 Apr 04.  The actual length of extension will be determined by the projected award date of follow-on Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) solicitation #F04684-02-R-0024.  By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new 6 year LOSC is being competed.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment.  Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

<CONTACT>Kerry Smith,937 257-6571 x4126
<DESC>The Air Force is seeking sources sought for five (5) potential competitive awards for 8(a) small business concerns. IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED  FROM 8(a) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS, FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE ACQUISTIONS, THE  PROJECT(S) MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought  for planning purposes only.   If a solicitation is issued, each of the below  projects will be advertised under a solicitation specific to that project  work.  The work is identified by the below listed project numbers.  Each  project includes furnishing all labor, equipment, appliances, devices and  materials, and performing all operations necessary in connection with: PROJECT 030039A Replace Roof/Maintain Exterior Bldg 18:  Project scope is to  accomplish a comprehensive facility exterior sustainment repair to include roof  replacement, limestone and masonry work, door replacement, glass and structural  steel restoration and lighting repair.  Restoration must be compatible with  base historical guidelines.  Building 18 is a historical facility, and  therefore will be held to stringent State Historic Preservation Office  standards.  Expertise in historical preservation is a must.  There are  stringent requirements in roofing, masonry cleaning and restoration.   Experience in roofing and limestone work will be a necessity.   PROJECTS 000060, 000060A, and 000060B Relocate DAPS from Facility 10281 to  Facility 20056:  The scope of this project includes architectural, electrical  and mechanical modification and reconfiguration of approximately 18,000 SF in  Facility 20056 to meet the production, storage, delivery and supporting  administrative functions of the Defense Automation Production Service (DAPS).   Specific specialized requirements include a climate-controlled shop/plant,  computer room, protected shop and storage area for sensitive materials, and  modifications of the sprinkler and fire alarm systems.  Facility 20056 is being  renovated to house the Defense Automation Production Service (DAPS) main  administrative offices, customer service and shop/plant areas.  This major  renovation project involves highly specialized climate-control and security  requirements, the complex management of numerous disciplines working  simultaneously and is subject to critical scheduling requirements. The  contractor must have extensive experience in the management of large multi- disciplined projects in order to successfully complete this effort.   PROJECT 030011A and 030011B Repair for Fire Safety – Basement Facility 20046:   Project is to repair large office area in windowless basement in order to  eliminate current FSD III (Fire Safety Deficiency). In order to install new  fire suppression, detection, and notification system integrated with existing  addressable alarm system, suspended ceilings will have to be replaced. Scope  includes relocation and reconfiguration of above ceiling utilities such as HVAC  ducts, diffusers, power junction box distribution, communication distribution,  and lighting fixtures. Options for incidental cosmetic finishes (carpet and  paint) are to be considered. This project is the first of two phases to bring  facility into compliance.  This renovation will have a tight completion  schedule with security restrictions in an occupied ASC System Program Office  facility. Work will be completed while maintaining access to existing exits. It  is imperative for constant contractor coordination of all subcontractor work  for timely completion of work in order to meet planned occupancy moves as part  of ASC’s Strategic Planning restructuring goals. Contract will include  maintaining temporary Electrical and HVAC systems for remaining occupants  (first and second floors) while installing new. Restroom work will be phased in  order to allow upper floors to remain on line and in use. Scope also includes  hazardous material abatement of asbestos and lead paint. PROJECT 020011 Remove Asbestos and Restore Interior, Facility 20018:  Project  scope includes the removal of asbestos insulated utilities in the attic space  of Facility 20018 and all the asbestos transite board enclosure around the  attic space, to include the restoration of the space below where this asbestos  is located.  The restoration includes removal and reinstallation of drop  ceilings, lighting, some walls and temporary rearrangement of mechanical  distribution and electrical systems to access the asbestos.  Safety has given  this area a RAC 3 based on the possible contamination below the attic space  into the office space. The asbestos poses a health hazard for personnel to get  up in the attic space to perform periodic maintenance.  This project will also  involve removal of asbestos and lead paint that must be dealt with by a  qualified contractor with a properly trained and certified work force.   PROJECTS 030047 and 9606201 Reconfigure SCIF Building 20 and Repair Building 20  Exterior Windows, respectively: Project scope includes accomplishing a  comprehensive interior facility sustainment repair to create Sensitive  Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) administrative and conference spaces  for up to 100 personnel and replacement of windows.  Facility construction must  be in compliance with the security criteria of DCID 6/9, “Physical Security  Standards for SCIFs”, dated 18 Nov 2002 (to be provided with specifications).    Special security access and control systems are required.  Special  communications support systems will be required.  Facility modifications must  be in compliance with fire safety and building codes and the requirements of  the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Included in this project are  embedded and contract option requirements for an elevator, two staircases, an  historically appropriate facility entrance and lobby, restroom renovations,  handicap accessible doors and ramps and exterior building curbs.  Systems  furniture purchase and installation is expected to be added to this as a  contract option.  Due to the security measures that need to be incorporated  into this project, the proposed contractor needs to have experience with  construction of SCIF workspaces.  Additionally, Building 20 is a historical  facility, and therefore will be held to stringent State Historic Preservation  Office standards particularly for the contract option for exterior work.   Expertise in this arena will be a pre-qualification requirement.  Experience in  demolition, masonry, concrete, and hazardous waste abatement will be required  for this project. Prime contractors who are 8(a) small businesses and who intend to submit a  proposal for one or more project solicitations MUST submit the following no  later than 1600 (local Dayton time), 15 calendar days from the date posted on  PIXS/FedBizOps.

<DESC>Amendment 01 for COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for S5105-04-Q-0025 Computer Based Training (CBT) for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) Certification NDT Discipline: Magnetic Particle

Change 1: The NAICS code should be 451511 not 451611.
Below are questions/answers.  There are some duplicate questions.  Each answer is specific to that question.
•Will DCMA provide Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) or identify individuals who are acceptable to DCMA as SMEs? DCMA will not provide SMEs, but will provide GFM.  However, the Technical PoC will be available to help guide the contractor...especially since progress reports are due every two months.
•What does the Government anticipate as the total amount of time for training/test taking?  There is no specific time requirement.  Rather the training should cover the requirements specified in the RFQ.
•Section V. of the Statement of Work states, “One of the critical types of inspections and tests involve Nondestructive Testing (NDT). Past practice was to certify and re-certify by examination, which was labor intensive and very expensive.”  What are the contractors responsibilities with regard to the certification and recertification test?  Will the contractor be required to be involved in the certification/recertification process beyond creating the tests? The contractor has no responsibility for certification and/or recertification other than providing the final product to DCMA.
•Section V of the Statement of Work states, “Commercially available CBTs have been identified that incorporates many of the competencies that are necessary for DCMA personnel, but additional modules and tests need to be developed to tailor the product for our purposes.” Will the contractor have access to or be provided the commercially available CBT? The contractor is expected to provide the commercial product as part of his quote.
•Section V a. of the Statement of Work states, The software must work in the DCMA Microsoft Windows environment and must be compatible with Adobe Acrobat.”  What is the DCMA Microsoft Windows environment, 98, 2000, XP? DCMA has 2000 and XP.  The program should download to the end user’s computer, but rather run as a separate program.  What is the base platform that the CBT will run on? Pentium 3, 4? DCMA uses both Pentium 3 & 4 equipment.  The Pentium 3s have 256 and the Pentium 4s have 512 RAM. What is the standard video card that is installed in the PCs used at DCMA? NEVIA QUADRO 4 200 NVS What is the standard monitor resolution that is used with the typical DCMA PC? Whatever the user set it at.  800 x 600 to 1600 x 1200 pixels
•Section V b. of the Statement of Work states, “Contractor will provide this CBT service on CDs (Compact Disks) and the final delivery will be two sets of CDs (one Master and one certified copy) from which DCMA will be able to make user copies (if necessary), and 85 re-usable training CDs that cannot be copied by users.”  Although it is possible to create a CD that cannot be copied DCMA would not be able to make copies.  We further believe that if the user is able to access the certification/recertification test(s) they will be able to ³cut and past² the test from the application it is running from or get the information using some other means (screen print, etc.). We would recommend that the tests be encrypted so that they are only accessible through a LMS or other suitable program or code. It this what was intended or is the intent not to be able to copy the CDs?  We want two separate products...one that is a master that can be copied if needed and one that is an end user product that can't be copied.  How you provide that is up to you.
•Section V g. of the Statement of Work states, “Material supplied by the contractor must cover” There are approximately 44 items that are to be supplied by the contractor  will each of the items (e.g., L/D ratios) require the development of instructional content and alternate forms of general and specific test items? The information in Section V.g.3 Needs Deliverables further indicates, “This information is to be provided in videos, pictures, text, and audio format on the CDs.”  Does the government has an approximate idea of the length of the video, text and audio that will be used to support the instruction/questions? This has a significant impact when costing a CBT project. The information in Section V.g.6 Needs Deliverables further indicates “A practical examination bank supplied by contractor that will consist of videotaped scenarios of magnetic particle inspections and system evaluations covering material required in above paragraph g. 3. The examination bank will contain at least eight (8) different scenarios for each major type of equipment.” Will the government provide the video for each of the scenarios or will the contractor be required to schedule the video shoots, shoot the video, edit the video, as any audio/test and incorporate the video into the CD? The contractor will take the identified GFM and build the requirement.  This includes audio and video as stated in the RFQ.  Will the DCMA provide stock video footage? No.  This is contractor responsibility.  Will the DCMA provide other source materials such as graphics? No.  This is contractor responsibility.  Will the government coordinate the 8 video shoots for each major type of equipment? No. This is contractor responsibility.  How many types of equipment are there that will require a video shoot?  The main types of equipment are horizontal stationary and portable.  An inspection requires magnetizing the item in two different directions.  The supporting equipment, methods, materials (prods, yokes, coils, cable wraps, central conductor, direct, wet, dry, colored or fluorescent particles) are to be used for the inspections (DCMA will assist by story-boarding the inspections with the contractor).  Not all the equipment will be used for each video (in other words if a coil is used in the video, then yokes and cable wrap will not be used in that video since all three of those are used for longitudinal inspections).  Basically, the contractor will be responsible for 16 video inspections.  Some of the systems are fluorescent so part of those videos will have be done under black light.   Approximately how many pictures of defects will have to be digitized prior to being incorporated into the test bank described in Section V.g.6? DCMA will need a selection of defects commonly found using Magnetic Particle Inspection, such as cracks, laps, seams, porosity, cold shuts, external forging bursts, both visible and fluorescent, etc.  The information in Section V.g.8 Needs Deliverables further indicates “Add a CBT module that incorporates DCMA?s guidance on NDT as key processes, risk rating, supporting risk rational, and the use of appropriate risk handling tools. This module will be suggestions of the likely activities used to proof the MT process, what typical activities would be accomplished when performing product audits, potential process measurement points, and suggestions on how to approach data collection and analysis for the MT process. DCMA will write the content of this module.”  DCMA will develop a module on DCMA Guidance on NDT. What is the anticipated length of the module to be developed by DCMA? The anticipated length of the module will have an impact on costing the project. Word document approx 10 pages long
•	Section V g. 4 of the Statement of Work states, “Data bank test questions will be password protected per user and will have an automatic grading feature. Program will automatically print out a certification stating that student has successfully completed that portion of the testing (or save a non-modifiable file for printing later).” The CBT is not part of a LMS.  The specifics of the test databank you quote should be part of the requested quote. Does this indicate that the CBT to be developed by the Contractor will function under a Learning Management System (LMS)? If so, which one?  How many alternative forms of each question are needed, i.e., how many questions are in the question bank? There will be approximately 160 general theory questions and approximately 160 specific questions.  Where will the test bank reside?  On the CD.  Will the test bank be stored on the CD and accessed when a test has to be generated? Yes, on the CD.  No on the hard drive or on a server.  Remember this MUST be a stand-alone system on a CD.  Will the test bank be stored on the hard drive of the PC being used by the student or will the test bank be stored on a network server?
•	Section V g. 4 and 5 of the Statement of Work states discuss a specific test bank and a general test question bank.  These CDs will be issued to various locations to be used as training material.  There are specific questions to magnetic particle NDT.  The training is not on the same computer each time.  What does the DCMA see as the differences between the specific and general questions? Questions are on different subjects.  Theory (general) questions are obviously on the theory of Magnetic Particle.  Specific questions are on the specifications and standards of Non-Destructive Testing.  When students take the test will they always use the same computer? No.  If students are able to use a different computer for each session there will be a requirement to move student records. How does the government anticipate that the student records be transferred, floppy disk, network, or is there an existing LMS?  We are not asking for record keeping.  We will be using the required print-out.
•The information in Section V.g.8 Needs Deliverables further indicates “A databank containing PDF files of Military/Government Specifications, Standards and Technical Publications on the subject of NDT. DCMA will provide files.”  What is the approximate volume (page count) of the materials that are to be included in the data bank?  MIL-HDBK-728/1 = 46 pages, MIL-HDBK-728/4 = 53 pages, MIL-STD-1907 = 22 pages, MIL-STD-2035A = 88 pages, T9074-AS-GIB-010/271 = 85 pages. Will the Contractor have access to electronic files for the materials or will they have to be re-keyed or scanned? They will be provided as Adobe files.
•The information in Section V.g.9 Needs Deliverables further indicates “Contractor¹s material should also include information on current industry manufacturing processes, production methods and types of discontinuities that may be expected (digitized video clips, audio, pictures, and diagrams of metal production & mills; casting, welding, metal forming, forging, etc). Module should go into detail (show actual defect types) of Inherent Material Discontinuities (Wrought and Cast), Processing Discontinuities, and Service Discontinuities.”
Will the government provide the video clips, audio clips, pictures of diagrams required for this section?  Will the contractor be required to identify the current industry manufacturing processes and coordinate photo/still shoots with the industry?  The contractor is expected to provide this information.  Again, most would be found in the commercial product proposed by the contractor.
•Section VI d and e of the Statement of Work states, “Sample of streaming video for quality assessment; no more than 5 minutes and a Sample from the program that randomly selects database test questions and generates tests.”  We understand that we will have to provide as part of our proposal streaming video and a sample of random test generation. Does the test sample provided by the bidder have to go automatic printing and encryption? No
•The contractor has designed and developed cutting edge CBT for the FAA and for FEMA. We have not specifically developed NDT CBT. Will this disqualify us from bidding? You are not disqualified.  However the RFQ does evaluate past performance to include CBT for NDT.
•Please supply the relative weighting of the award factors.  In particular, how important is previous development of NDT CBT? (factor (f)).   each factor is not separately weighted; but rather the non-price factors are more important than price
•Does DCMA already have a commercial product that it is using and will continue to use?  If so:  No Is there any expectation to match the look and feel, and interactivity types of current product? Does the product have a testing module that meets DCMA requirements?  Does the RFQ clearly identify which modules belong to the CBT in current use, and the modules which will need to be additionally developed? Please identify the product and vendor.
If not: Do you expect the project to incorporate ALL new material developed for this CD set? Yes  Will DCMA write a complete Test Module specification, or base it on the sample submitted by the offerrer? DCMA will provide GFM as necessary.  Does DCMA expect the length and depth of treatment for each topic to be similar to the commercially available products? Yes. What automatic remediation capabilities does DCMA require? None.  What is the DCMA expectation regarding reporting training results? N/A for the contractor.
•Does DCMA require a menu of available training tracks--Initial, Refresher, etc?  No 
•Is there a requirement to deliver CDs that no user will be able to copy with normal equipment?  That requirement is stated in the RFQ...one master that can be copied and 85 copies that cannot be copied 
•What part of the CBT must be compatible with Acrobat?  The certifications?  The interactive materials (e.g. export a screen to Acrobat)?  In allowing concurrent use of a resource data bank?  Adobe files containing the specifications and standards will be inserted on the CD.  (MIL-HDBK-728/1 = 46 pages, MIL-HDBK-728/4 = 53 pages, MIL-STD-1907 = 22 pages, MIL-STD-2035A = 88 pages, T9074-AS-GIB-010/271 = 85 pages.)   The student must be able to print those files to use during the tests (we have found that paper copies are easier for students to use during tests and they will have back-up material for the ensuing certification period).  
•Is the Tech Pub data bank to be available from the normal training user interface?  Will this be an Acrobat window?   Your quote will address the training content set up 
•How familiar is the DCMA trainee with CBT and interactive video?  Will extensive HELP be required?  Experienced and help will be provided in house if required 
•Does DCMA have a specific list of training objectives that the contractor's CBT must meet (in addition to the list of topics found in the RFQ)?  No  
•Can DCMA provide an example of desired certification tests for NDT inspectors prior to final quote?  No  
•Please be more specific about the nature of the assistance NDT technical authority will provide:  DCMA will provide a technical expert to ensure DCMA requirements are met.  The contractor should be familiar with NDT requirements.  Scenarios/shooting scripts for practical exam items?  Venues and equipment for videotaping scenarios? Personnel for the scenarios? Existing video? On-site expert approval during video shoots?
•Is a course syllabus (incl approx lesson lengths, units and number of specific tests) to be agreed on before final quotes?  No 
•What is the detailed design specification for test data bank security, and which user (trainee or contracting agency) will need password protection?  The design is up to the contractor.  The test bank should be password protected  
•Will the DCMA issue a more detailed specification for the Risk Management module prior to final quote?  The Risk Management module will be provided as a Word document, not more than 10 pages in length.  
•Is the one-time payment at contract conclusion and acceptance of all CLINs non-negotiable?  Based on determination after a review of the contractor's financial status 
•Will DCMA provide NDT Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) or is the contractor responsible for NDT SMEs?  DCMA will provide Government Furnished Material to help build the required DCMA modules.  DCMA will have a technical point of contact to work with the contractor to answer specific questions as they arise while the contractor creates the CBT.  DCMA will not provide SMEs to the contractor in regards to NDT requirements and specifics.  One of the evaluation criteria is past performance of NDT CBT. 
•Will DCMA provide a “Story Board” for the proposed CBT?  No, DCMA will assist, but contractor is responsible for product.
•Will DCMA provide a script for the proposed CBT?  No, DCMA will assist, but contractor is responsible for product.
•Will DCMA provide subject matter content?  If yes what content will be provided?  Again, DCMA will provide Government Furnished Material as covered in the RFQ Section V. h.  
•What version of MS Windows is utilized by DCMA?  According to our IT department as of 15 Mar 04, every end user computer will have XP.  Training rooms will continue to use 2000.  I believe the CBT will be used in both operating environments. 
•Please verify that there will only be one payment upon submission of the completed CLINs versus progress payments.  The expected award is for a firm-fixed price paid upon delivery.  After award, if necessary, payment options may be discussed. 
•Approximately how many hours of user training is expected for the completed CBT modules required by this solicitation?  There are no "expected" hours.  The material will need to cover the requirements as stated in the RFQ. 
•Are the CBTs required in this solicitation stand alone, or are they to be a part of other existing CBTs that exist?  The CBTs will be stand alone.  However, DCMA does have other CBT throughout the Agency. 
•Will DCMA provide all PDF files referenced in SOW section 8 (Data bank containing pdf files)?  As stated in the RFQ, DCMA will provide.  
•The Solicitation indicated that the evaluation criteria include CBT for NDT Past Performance.  If our company submits three (3) CBT past performances developed for the Government covering various subject matter but not specifically NDT subject matter, will our proposal be disqualified?  The proposal will not be disqualified.  However, RFQ Section VII. f. states Past Performance to include CBT for NDT.  This means a company with CBT NDT experience may be given a higher evaluation in past performance.  
•As a HUBZone certified small businesses will our company be allowed a ten percent price evaluation preference?  As requested by the RFQ Section VIII., please provide all certifications for evaluation.
•Regarding Evaluation Criterion f. "Past Performance to include CBT for NDT.  Provide not more than 3 references and/or samples.":  Our firm is highly experienced with NDT, including magnetic particle testing.  We plan to team with another firm that is highly experienced with computer-based training.  Can you advise if past experience with CBT for NDT is a necessary qualification?  Specifically, since neither firm has produced CBT for NDT, per se, would our offer be considered seriously or dismissed out of hand based on criterion "f."? although not necessary, past performance of NDT CBT is evaluated.  I encourage you to sharte no more than 3 examples of past performance for both your company and the subcontractor
•Will you consider using more than one vendor for this solicitation?  This project will require the services of a full-service CBT Development Team.  Instructional Designer, Subject Matter Expert, Graphic Artist, Narrator, and Multimedia Programmer.  My company can meet the requirements of module development, graphics, narration, and testing.  However, we are not Subject     Matter Experts or Content Writers in NDT.  Vendor has the option of using subcontractors.  There are some NDT vendors available.
•Approximately, how many one-hour modules will this course contain?  I can submit an accurate quote if we knew the number of modules.   Each quote will be unique. However, all areas listed in the training material should be covered.  Other NDT training materials have had 10 to 20 hours of material.
•Will DCMA have staff available to collaborate with the vendor on this project?  Will DCMA provide content writing and advisement during the project?  DCMA NDT Technical Experts will be approving the material, but we will not have the time or resources to fully collaborate with the vendor.  The synopsis-solicitation states what modules we will write (Risk Management and the Theory/Specific test questions.)
•What materials will DCMA submit to the awarded vendor(s) on this project?  (content, video, etc.)  In the solicitation, several things were mentioned sporadically. See above response.
•Do you expect the vendor to provide video on the selected topics?  Yes
•Are you looking for a company who specifically has a background in NDT to develop the modules and examination for this course?  Most CBT developers can develop program on any selected topic.  However, in most situations, the customer submits all required material to develop the course.  According to the solicitation it seems you are requesting the vendor to write content on NDT.  Is this true?  The answer to the first question of is: we can't direct who can bid on this work or what background they need.  All we can do is list our requirements.  It is up to the vendor to meet those requirements.  The answer to the second part of is yes, we need the vendor to write the content.
•What type of interaction would you like in the course?  Fill-in-the blank, HotSpot, Drag and Drop, etc.  The questions that we (DCMA) will be providing for the Theory & Spec modules are in a multiple choice and true/false format.  We need a system that randomly selects certain number of questions from the databank, presents them to the student who takes the test on the computer, automatically grades the test and informs the student of their grade (prints off a completion form or something).  We also need the vendor to develop a practical test consisting of the videotaped scenarios. 
•Do you want feedback provided for practice and test questions?  We can have feed back for the practice questions, but the final questions for certification maintenance need to be secured and the answers are not to be given to the student.
•Will you require narration in all modules and examinations?  Audio in the modules is required (not on every page, but in areas of a lot of text, audio helps students learn).  Audio is not required in the examinations (when I am concentrating on a test, I don't want someone talking at me).
•In the solicitation, the statement, "one payment will be made when all CLINS have been delivered" puzzles me. It will be extremely difficult to do this over 12 months. Costs will be incurred during the projects. contractors will have to be paid and other costs will be incurred during the development phase.  Can you explain the reasoning behind one payment versus periodic payments after submitting prototypes and progress reports?  Past market research and solicitations show it it reasonable for the government to award a Firm Fixed Price contract without any special payment arrangements.  However, once a vendor has been selected and during the Post-Award conference the discussion of payment may be readdressed.

All DVD shipments shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD 52.211-9008.  When the contract/order omits any data element required to be bar-coded, the field shall be zero-filled.  These requirements do not apply to delivery orders when the basic contract has not been modified to require MIL-STD-129P.  If there are inconsistencies between the schedule and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.

2.	The following Clause is hereby added to the Addendum to FAR 52.212-4:
DLAD 52.211-9010	Military Shipping Label (MSL) Requirements- MIL-STD-129P  (Feb 2004)
 
  (a)  MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December 15, 2002, establishes the requirement for Contractors that ship packaged materiel to the Government to provide both linear and two-dimensional (2-D) bar coding on military shipping labels (MSLs) (but see exceptions in paragraph (d)).  The new requirements apply to all shipments, which includes either depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-Direct) shipments.  Linear (Code 3 of 9 or Code 39) bar codes continue to be required on interior packages (unit and intermediate packages) for the National Stock Number (NSN) and, when applicable, the serial number; and on shipping containers and palletized unit loads for the NSN, Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) Code, contract number and, when applicable, the serial number.  The new requirements do not apply to delivery orders when the basic contract has not been modified to require MIL-STD-129P.
 
  (b)  The new MSL replaces former DD Form 1387 and is illustrated in Figures 2a and 2b of MIL-STD-129P.  The MSL requires Code 3 of 9 or Code 39 linear bar codes for the Transportation Control Number (TCN), piece number and DoDAAC for the ultimate consignee or mark-for address.  The 2-D bar code on the MSL must contain the document (requisition) number, NSN, Routing Identifier Code (RIC), Unit of Issue, Quantity, Condition Code, and Unit Price, which are ordinarily included on the DD Form 250 or the DD Form 1348-1A.  MIL-STD-129P provides numerous illustrations of what must be bar-coded and the recommended placement of the bar code.  When the contract omits any data element required to be bar-coded, the field should be zero-filled.
 
  (c)  MIL-STD-129P, sources for conforming labels, and related information are available on the DLA Packaging Web Site at URL: http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/packaging/specstdslist.html#STDs.

Background	                           

Recent events have reinforced the importance of FDA’s long-standing interest in the development of improved methods for the identification of potential threat agents in foods.  CFSAN maintains an active research program for developing and enhancing methodologies to detect and identify microbial hazards that may contaminate food and food products either naturally or through deliberate contamination.  Standard protocols for isolation of the most commonly occurring pathogens have been developed.  Traditionally, these protocols rely on enrichment and selective culture media for the isolation of a pathogen from the food.  CFSAN needs to further enhance its detection and identification capabilities with respect to pathogens that are not typically considered to be foodborne pathogens.  Specifically, there is a need to develop bacterial growth media that will improve the recovery of these atypical pathogens from priority food matrices.  Initial efforts will focus specifically in the detection of Brucella and Burkholderia species associated with human disease. 

Statement of Work

The contract shall include preliminary assessment of growth and isolation characteristics of pure culture isolates in media from commercial or other sources.  Furthermore, selected media preparations which have been found to hold the greatest promise for fulfillment of the goals will be evaluated for use with representative food matrix categories of interest.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work. 

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement.  All services shall be provided in a timely manner to help ensure that CFSAN can fulfill its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents.

Task 1

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Brucella abortus, melitensis, and suis (Brucella spp.).  These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Brucella spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp. species from food.

Task 2

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei (Burkholderia spp).   These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Burkholderia spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp. from food.

Security Issues

All personnel involved in the performance of this task order shall have a secret or higher security clearance.  The clearance shall be obtained prior to commencement of any work.  Performance of this task order shall be conducted in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  The manual can be accessed at the following web site:   <http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm>.

<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Reference “Cisco NetFlow Data Analyzer” when responding to this announcement. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is attempting to identify vendors that are capable of providing a platform capable of capturing, recording, and reporting on Cisco NetFlow data. The Agency is seeking sources that produce a software package and/or hardware/software solution that will meet the following requirements:
1. Supports NetFlow;
a. Cisco IOS® NetFlow technology is an integral part of Cisco IOS Software that collects and measures data as it enters specific routers or switch interfaces. By analyzing NetFlow data, a network manager can identify the cause of congestion; determine the class of service (CoS) for each user and application; and identify the source and destination network for traffic. NetFlow allows extremely granular and accurate traffic measurements and high-level aggregated traffic collection. Because it is part of Cisco IOS Software, NetFlow enables Cisco product-based networks to perform IP traffic flow analysis without purchasing custom probes--making traffic analysis economical on large IP networks. 
b. Cisco NetFlow documentation can be found at http://www.cisco.com/go/NetFlow
2. Supports version 5 or 9 of NetFlow
3. Supported webserver platforms are either IIS or Apache.
4. Does not include open-source code.
5. Must scale from single interface to multiple thousands of interfaces
6. Must be capable of alarming, trending, and reporting on varied parameters and data points, e.g. alarm on excessive utilization, excessive or threshold met on http/telnet/icmp/etc..
Solutions should concentrate on SSA’s intent to utilize NetFlow’s performance management features without excluding the billing management and other NetFlow features.
Any proposed hardware or software must be Section 508 compliant.  Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency’s requirement. Vendors responding should indicate whether their services are available on the GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC). This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources. Responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by March 16, 2004. No Faxed responses will be accepted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. ELECTRONIC RESPONSES ONLY, to the POC identified below.

<DESC>The Southern Plains Area for the Agricultural Research Service, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to RBI Instrumentation et mesure, 1 chemin de la Dhuy, ZAC de Maupertuis, 38240 MEYLAN, FRANCE.  This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations (RFQ) for competition.  This is a simplified acquisition.  The USDA, ARS, Hydraulics Engineering Research Unit, in Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA requires 1 Two-Tip Fiber-Optical Probe.  The fiber-optical device consists of three components:  (1) a fiber optical probe, (2) an opto-electronic module and (3) a computer interface board.  The later serves to save and visualize the results.  This system is specifically designed and configured for local air concentration and velocity measurements in air-water free surface flow.  The size of the probe tip (.1mm), the probe tip material (saphire), and the strength of the probe fixture are all customized features, which allow this probe to be effectively used in stepped spillway research.  
The measuring principle is based on the different refraction indices of the air and water phases.  The opto-electronic module transmits light through an optical fiber, which is connected to the probe located in the flow.  The sensitive probe tip is sharpened into an optical prism through which a fraction of the light escapes, the rest is reflected according to the refraction index of the phase at the probe.  In clear water virtually no light is reflected, whereas in dry air all light is reflected.  The optical signal is transferred into an electrical signal by means of a photosensitive diode.  The fiber-optical system has the following advantages compared to conventional resistivity probes:
1.  Signal transfer is much faster, the signal response time being only 0.033 s compared to 10 s.  2.  Sampling frequency of 102 to 103 kHz is a least one order of magnitude larger than the conventional frequency.  3.  Size of the probe tip (.1mm) is considerably smaller, so that both tiny bubbles of about the probe tip diameter can be detected and the disturbance to the flow remains small.  This device is not an off the shelf product but rather a custom designed system customized specifically for stepped spillway research.  Questions should be received within 14 calendar days of this published notification.   Questions may be directed to: Michael A. Douglas, Contracting Officer at (979) 260-9480 or Fax: (979) 260-9413.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information and sources Sought Synopsis to identify possible potential sources for submission of capability statements for firms with the capability to provide surgical linen services as further summarized herein for the Department of Anesthesia and Surgical Services (DASS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center (CC) in Bethesda, Maryland. The type of linen that would be included would be all-sized surgical scrubs and a variety of linens used in Operating room (OR). DASS performs approximately 2500 surgical procedures per year. The OR and staff are available 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 365 days per year. The number of surgeons and members of DASS staff total approximately 200. The vendor would be required to provide surgical scrubs and linens directly to DASS and to purchase and maintain the linen inventory in good repair which includes disposal of all torn, worn linen and procurement of replacements to the stipulated par levels. Additionally, the vendor would be required to pick up soiled scrubs from the Scrub Avail machine and to restock it directly with matched sized laundered scrub sets each day. The vendor would also be required to maintain the OR surgical scrub inventory to include disposal of torn, worn scrubs and procurement of replacements to PAR levels, per the Scrub Avail capacity, ranging in size from x-small to 3XL. The vendor would receive training on the ScrubAvail computer by designated Central Hospital Supply staff. Surgical scrubs cannot be patched, stitched, re-sewn or thermasealed. All surgical linen and surgical scrub apparel color selection shall be misty green and be stamped with an NIH logo as determined by the Government. The vendor would maintain the Scrub Avail database, managing user additions and deletions, credit distributions, tracking the number and sizes of scrubs that are required for daily restocking. All soiled surgical scrubs and the soiled linens would be picked up once a day, by 6:00 a.m., regardless of weather or traffic conditions, 6 days a week from predetermined locations in the confines of the OR. The linen would be bagged in an impervious bag and placed in a covered cart provided by the vendor in a designated location within the confines of the OR. Clean linen will be delivered by the vendor directly to the designated carts in the OR on a daily basis. When the vendor delivers both the linen and the surgical scrubs, the cart will be wrapped with plastic. If the plastic is ripped/cracked or otherwise damaged, the shipment is unacceptable. The cart will be cleaned on a daily basis by the vendor to prevent the transmission of dirt to the OR. One cart must be designated “clean” for the transportation of clean scrubs  and linen. One cart must be designated “dirty” for the transportation of dirty scrubs and linen. DASS linen and surgical scrubs cannot be co-mingled with linen from other facilities. The vendor would be required to meet all JCAHO and other regulatory requirements. The vendor must ensure that they comply with all applicable federal and state government regulations regarding control of infectious diseases in health care facilities. Vendors should consult the specific regulations for further details, exemptions, documentation and record keeping.

This is not a request for proposals or quotes and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 812332. The purpose of this survey is to improve the understanding of the Government’s requirements and industry capabilities and allow the Government to obtain quality supplies and services at reasonable prices. Capability statements being supplied should include at a minimum at least the following information: 1. List of recent past performance references (at lest 5 for hospital OR linen laundry services), including contact names, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, a description of the contract services provided, duration of contract and estimated costs. 2.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICES OFFICE ADDRESS:  AAC/YEC 207 West D Ave, Ste 301, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5417 SUBJECT: WEAPON DATA LINK NETWORK DESC:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) concerning weapon connectivity to networks.  Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to plan a possible future Advanced Concept Technology Development (ACTD) effort.  THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  The Air Armament Center, Armament Enterprise Program Office, Concept and Technology Development Division is seeking information regarding technology challenges and solutions involved in dynamically connecting weapons to networks (including Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR,) Command and Control (C2) nodes, strike assets, etc.) that enable improved precision, responsiveness, impact indications and battlespace awareness.  Several weapons will soon need to adopt datalinks that would enable these functions, but currently there is no standard approach to integrating weapons into C2 networks.  A solution is desired for implementing the following capabilities:
-	In-Flight Target Updates (post aircraft weapon release) from any network participant:  Refine Target Location Uncertainty (TLU) for targets during weapon ingress.
-	Bomb Impact Assessment (BIA):  Transmit to network just prior to impact.
-	Weapon In-Flight Tracking:  Provide weapon’s location and status to the network.
-	Re-targeting:  Attack pop-up targets while en route.
-	Abort on Command:  To avoid collateral effects.
Current networks provide good connectivity, but available network standard terminals are not small enough to integrate into weapons (and other terminals are not widely fielded).  This size issue is being addressed by the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) but will take several years to complete.  Network architecture issues must be resolved to facilitate future integrations, while also accommodating datalink solutions using UHF SATCOM.  A network weapons Interface Control Document (ICD) will be developed with a goal of benefiting the joint services.  A potential ACTD is planned to address the following issues:
-	Standardize weapon message set and information exchange requirements
-	Standardize uses and meanings of weapon data within message sets
-	Standardize network/time slot allocation process for weapons
-	Explore Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) and network design requirements for weapon control
-	Explore limits of network for handling numerous weapons simultaneously
-	Explore Concept of Operations for networked weapons and network design
This ACTD will design and exercise a realistic tactical network that enables network-centric weapon operations, demonstrating the following:
-	Allocation of network time slots to weapons
-	UHF messaging via gateway to network
-	Inclusion of other network participants (e.g., CAOC, ground forward air controller, shooter)
-	Information transfer required to implement desired datalink benefits—BIA, re-targeting, etc.
This ACTD will reduce risk for the integration of network-centric weapons in general, by defining architectures, interfaces, messages and tactics needed to allow weapons to function within the networks of today and tomorrow. Respondents will also be asked to provide a recommendation for an appropriate weapon Software Communication Architecture (SCA) compliance definition. As part of this recommendation, the respondent should identify the main cost drivers for SCA implementation in weapons applications. The Air Force contemplates an arrangement in which the winning contractor will have responsibility for all integration tasks via Associate Contractor Agreements with those firms which developed and maintain other elements of the Weapon Data Link Network system of systems. These elements are expected to include:
-	Weapon Data Link brassboard provided by AFRL or other suitable solution
-	Combined Air Operations Center software and systems integration
-	Tactical Air Control Party radios and associated software
-	Flight test aircraft (slow-moving, non-military airplane of convenience)
-	Weapon prime contractors (JASSM-ER, WCMD-ER, SDB Increment 2, JSOW C, Harpoon 21, Tactical Tomahawk, etc.) 
-	Weapon surrogate 
At the choice of the winning contractor, this weapon surrogate may consist of an external pod, internally mounted aircraft racks, or a captive-carriage test article from an existing weapon program. In the latter case, if appropriate, the winning contractor should provide a discussion of the costs and benefits of using such a test item on a military jet versus a slow-moving airplane. Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to propose teaming arrangements, provide a cost estimate, schedule, and risk analysis for managing the overall integration responsibility. In the interest of developing a comprehensive ACTD plan, inputs from industry are desired in the form of concept papers or presentations.  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Respondents are encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a formal Request for Proposals (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government. Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Air Armament Center, Armament Enterprise Program Office, Concept and Technology Development Division, AAC/ YEC, Bldg 349, 207 West D Ave., Suite 301, Eglin Air Force Base, FL 32542-5417, ATTN: Mr. Craig Pope at 850-882-3075, or at 850-882-6982, Ext. 6087, or send electronically to <craig.pope@eglin.af.mil>.  Please provide electronic responses with this subject: RFI for WEAPON DATA LINK NETWORK. Responses must be received no later than 3 PM CDT on March 8, 2004. For technical questions, please contact Mr. John Cserep at 850-882-6982 x6088 or by email at <john.cserep@eglin.af.mil>.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California intends to extend the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, for a period of four to six months, commencing 1 Apr 04.  The actual length of extension will be determined by the projected award date of follow-on Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) solicitation #F04684-02-R-0024.  By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new 6 year LOSC is being competed.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment.  Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

ADD: CREW LIST.  Offerors must provide an accurate and current crew list within 24 hours of contract award and, additionally, no later than 96 hours prior to delivery of the vessel at the designated load or delivery port (or first designated load port in the case of multiple load ports), time permitting.  Further, at any time during the contract period a list of any reliefs scheduled to board the vessel is required 96 hours prior to the personnel change.  The crew list shall include full name (including middle name or the letters “NMN” if no middle name), date of birth, place of birth (city and country), passport number and country of issue, and nationality of all crewmembers and other personnel onboard the vessel. The list shall be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Excel only).  Scanned lists are unacceptable.  Any delay resulting from Owner’s failure to provide the list within the prescribed time frames shall be considered as time excluded under clause III(m)(3).


ADD:  IN-TRANSIT VISIBILITY.
 
    (1) The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

    (2) In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the INMARSAT-C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

ADD:  SALVAGE.

(1) When engaged in the carriage of government cargo and if requested by Charterer, Owner agrees to accept Navy salvage services.  Such services may be provided using Navy personnel and resources or Navy contracted resources.

(2) In providing such services, the Navy, through Charterer, agrees to waive all claims for “pure” or “bonus” salvage.  Instead, in those cases in which the salvage services are provided by Navy personnel and resources, the salvage claim shall be limited to a schedule of current per diem rates and allowable expenses as established by the Navy’s Supervisor of Salvage.  In no event shall such amount exceed a maximum claim of $25,000 per day.

(3) In those situations in which the Navy utilizes contracted resources to deliver assistance, Owner shall be liable for the actual daily rate charged to the Navy by the contractor(s).

(4) It is understood that this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim is asserted against the vessel only, is solely for the vessel's account, and does not include any amounts for the salvage of the Government's cargo.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, this limited Supervisor of Salvage claim IS NOT directly or by way of setoff chargeable in whole or in part to the Government by way of general average or otherwise.

ADD: DEMURRAGE DOCUMENTATION.  In the event of demurrage, all supporting documents as identified in TANKVOY III(d) (3) Invoices, shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer for approval prior to submission of demurrage invoices. After receiving the Contracting Officer's concurrence, Owner may submit demurrage invoices (with the DD Form 250-1) to the office identified in Box 18b of SF 1449.

Description of requirements: The Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD currently owns multiple flash x-ray systems to instrument and record info rmation from ballistic experiments.  Of particular interest here are pulsers used as a major component within both 300 KV and 450 KV flash x-ray systems.  The Army desires to upgrade these assets by 1) converting them to operate with dry compressed air ins tead of currently required sulfur hexafluoride gas and 2) refurbish them to original operating condition by replacing internal components that have broken down due to normal wear and tear and exposure to the elements.  After the refurbishment the pulsers w ill have the capability to reliably operate using dry, compressed air as the working gas and without electrical breakdown.  The Army is planning to pay for the refurbishment of ten (10) pulsers.  ARLs technical requirements are based on the Government-owne d asset, Titan Systems Corporation Part Numbers 43734A and 43733A, used in 450 KV flash x-ray system.  The following are the expected tasks to accomplish for this refurbishment: Air conversion and refurbishment of pulser (pulser model identified as Titan p art number 43734A) used in 450 KV flash x-ray system. Air conversion will allow pulsers to operate with dry, compressed air (instead of currently required sulfur hexaflouride gas) to prevent electrical breakdown.  Refurbishment includes complete replacemen t of all o-rings, spark balls, plungers, springs, trigger ball assembly, and electrical test of all modules to verify proper function of refurbished pulser.   Testing and pressure certification of 450 KV remote tube head to verify that tube head will operate properly at the increased working pressure created by the air conversion of the associated pulser.  Air conversion control panel for 450 KV flash x-ray syst em, part number 130-195100 Air conversion and refurbishment for pulser (pulser identified as Titan part number 43733A) used in 300 KV flash x-ray system.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   DESC: Section I. The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of a 6.2 Research & Development Program as described below.  Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines  set forth herein.  This Research Announcement (RA) constitutes the total solicitation.  There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: The Army is antici pating the development of new centerline turboshaft engines for use in future manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of the Future Force. These engines will be developed under the DOD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program .  The Small Affordable Turbine Engine (SATE) program will be conducted under the VAATE program and will demonstrate progress towards the VAATE phase II turboshaft/turboprop goals beginning in the FY08 timeframe. The SATE program goals will be to demonstra te a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in production and maintenance cost and a design life of 6000 hrs in a 1800 hp class (1500-2100 hp) turboshaft engine.  In order to meet the aggr essive goals of the SATE program, significant advancements in gas generator/ power turbine technologies will be required.  The aggressive performance goals of the SATE engine dictate the need for increased rotational speeds, temperatures, and pressures. Th ese conditions create significant challenges for components in the gas generator/power turbine of the SATE engine.   Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop advanced gas generator/power turbine technologies that possess the combination of performance, durability, and affordability necessary to enable SATE technology level turboshaft engines to achieve their performance, durability, cost and life goals.

AWARD INFORMATION: ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  Anticipated period of performance is 48 months total with 45 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the fi nal report. Government Estimate: Government Share = $900,000 per award (Distribution: FY04-05; 15%, FY06; 30%, FY07 40%, FY08 15%).  Proposals must follow the g uidelines described in this announcement.  TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  Due to the commercial application of this engine component development effort, the Government anticipates an award of a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement (10  U.S.C. 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments.  It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practicable, cost sharing of at least half of the costs of the proj ect to ensure that the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation by the Recipient of at least 50% are anticipated for each award made because the technology has high dual-use  potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost sharing is addressed in Part 37 of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoD 3210.6-R). This RA will remain open until 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time 26 April 2004.  The earliest anticipated award date is 30 June 2004; however, the awards may be staggered.  There will be one or more awards (but likely not more than two) under this announcement, based on Gov ernment funding availability.   Unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals will be considered valid for Government acceptance through 31 October 2004.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of  the proposals received.  Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposal (i.e., certain tasks vs. total program).  Multiple proposals from the same offeror that address different solutions or tha t address only part of the problem under the announcement will be accepted and evaluated independently, but must be clearly identified in each proposal.  Section III.  Eligibility Information:  Participation in the project announced in this RA is limited t o U. S. firms as prime recipient.  A Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful offerors.  Such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this announcement. Due to the co mplexity and technical considerations of this program and the eventual requirement for an ATPP, the announcement is not set aside for small businesses.   Section IV.  Application and Submission Information.  This RA contains the total solicitation.  No spe cial application kits/forms/materials are required. GENERAL: The technical proposal should provide a clear justification for the selection of the proposed advanced gas generator/power turbine engine technologies. The justification/rational supporting the p roposed technology should be based upon the potential contribution of the proposed technology to the overall achievement of the SATE engine level performance, durability, cost and life goals.  The proposal will be structured as follows:  1) Task I Ã¢Â€Â“ D esign; 2) Task II Ã¢Â€Â“ Fabrication; 3) Task III Ã¢Â€Â“ Validation Testing.

Any information given to a prospective offeror concerning this announcement, which is necessary in submitting offers or the lack of which would be prejudicial to any  other prospective offeror(s), will be published as an amendment to this announcement.  For purposes of this RA, late proposals will be treated in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.  A copy of any cited reference/clause is available via link: http://farsite.hil l.af.mil/vffara.htm. Section V.  Application Review Information. EVALUATION CRITERIA/BASIS FOR AWARD:  The selection for award will be based on a scientific and/or engineering evaluation of proposals (both technical and cost as it relates to technical effo rt) in accordance with the criteria set forth in this section.  Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement.  These evaluations will result in narrative ratings, which will be used to d evelop an order of merit listing for proposals submitted under this announcement.  Proposed cost will be evaluated as appropriate, for realism and reasonableness.  The evaluation criteria are:  (1) The extent to which the proposed work satisfies the ArmyÃ¢ Â€Â™s research need by use of innovative, creative, efficient, and affordable approaches to the technical objectives.  (2)  The merit of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s proposed approach to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives.  (3)  The experience and qu alifications of the scientists, engineers, technicians, and other proposed personnel.  (4)  The suitability and availability of proposed facilities.  (5)  Realism of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort.  Prop osed costs must reflect a clear understanding of the requirements and be reasonable and consistent with the various elements of the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s technical proposal.  Any proposed cost share will be evaluated for its benefit in reducing program risk, achi eving program objectives, and furthering the state-of-the-art.  Proposed cost to the Government is a review criterion.  The amount of cost sharing percentage could result in greater evaluation credit.  Evaluation criteria (1) and (2) are equal and signific antly more important than criteria (3), (4) and (5) which are relatively equal.  Note:  In applying the above criteria, the relative weighting of engine level goals is specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight, and life being weighted significantly h igher than, production, and maintenance cost.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:  All work performed under Agreement(s) resulting from this RA will be unclassified and will not require access to classified material.  A determination has been made that performance und er the agreement(s) will require access to and/or generate technical data the export of which may be restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U. S. C., Sec. 2751 et. Seq.) or Executive Order 12470.  Prior to award, the successful firm(s) will be required to provide an Ã¢Â€ÂœExport-Controlled DoD Data AgreementÃ¢Â€Â certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25.
