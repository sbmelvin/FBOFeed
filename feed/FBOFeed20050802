<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has delegated authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on prospective ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as conducting periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, and other relevant regulations, and Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures that will be made known to the Contractor.
 
ATF has established a program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience conducting personnel security background investigations.

Contractors must undergo, or currently maintain, a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation, be compliant with DOJ’s residency requirement, and if applicable, must be registered in the Selective Service.  Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.

Contractors are assigned work that is in reasonable proximity to their residence.  Typically Contractors, are assigned the majority of their work within a 200-mile radius of their residence, but may on occasion, be requested to accept work assignments involving travel to other regions in the United States.  Work assignments are made on the basis of workload, volume of work determined by location, quality of work, and financial considerations as the needs of ATF dictate.

Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Work assignments are required to be completed by the due date determined by ATF.  Internal reviews of Contractors’ performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

With each assignment, Contractors shall be tasked to complete one or more of the following investigative requirements:

-	Personal security interview;
-	Verify identity and citizenship status;
-	Verify employment through records and interviews;
-	Verify claims of residence through records and interviews;
-	Verify attendance at educational facilities through records and interviews;
-	Conduct personal interviews with references;
-	Develop and interview additional sources;
-	Conduct military record reviews;
-	Conduct law enforcement checks;
-	Verify and review public records; 
-	Expand the investigation as necessary.

Each assignment will specify the following:

-	The work to be performed by the Contractor;
-	The place(s) where the work is to be performed;
-	An assignment initiation date;
-	A due date determined by type of investigation and/or priority; and
-	The number of estimated points.

ATF’s contract background investigation program utilizes a point-based payment method.  Contractors shall be paid for investigative assignments based on the point system.  Each point is valued at $39.50.  The point value will be reviewed on an annual basis and may be adjusted as determined by the increase of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  With the exception of the personal security interview, Contractors will be paid $12.00 per page for reports prepared by the Report Writer software program.
 
When using their personal automobile in connection with performing assignments, Contractors will be reimbursed for mileage driven at the prevailing rate established by the General Services Administration.  

When specifically authorized, per diem and expenses will be paid for required travel.  Applicable per diem rates shall be in accordance with Federal Travel Regulation, Title 41 CFR, Chapter 301.

In compliance with ATF’s invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of miles driven, as well as any other incidental expenses, in connection with any particular assignment.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF.

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  

Contractors are required to report the results of the investigative assignment utilizing Report Writer software, which will be supplied by ATF.  In order to receive assignments and to complete the required Report of Investigation (ROI), Contractors must possess, or have access to, certain equipment, and possess the knowledge to use it.  The following equipment and related software programs are required:

-	A personal computer with a minimum operating system of Windows 2000™ or newer.
-	An Inkjet or LaserJet printer.  Dot-matrix printers are not acceptable equipment.
-	A full version of Microsoft Word®. (Microsoft Works® will not suffice as an acceptable software program.)
- 	Each personal computer must have Microsoft Excel® loaded thereon.
-	Each personal computer must have Microsoft Access® loaded thereon, or Contractors must be able to download from the World Wide Web a “reader” that will permit the Contractor to read Microsoft Access® documents.
-	Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Microsoft Outlook®.  (Microsoft Outlook Express®, standing alone, will not be sufficient.)
-	Each personal computer must have loaded thereon Adobe Acrobat Reader®, version 5.0 or higher.
-	An Internet provider that allows for the transmission and receipt of email and attachments (preferably high speed broadband, DSL, or similar service).
-	The personal computer will have Norton anti-virus or equivalent installed, operational, and running current virus definitions at all times.

-	Facsimile machine or the ability to send and receive faxes from home or home-office.
- 	Paper shredder to destroy documents, notes, and other case related material after 120 days.

Contractors will be required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding regarding protection of ATF data associated with ATF background investigations agreeing to the following terms and provisions:

-	The personal computer will have Norton anti-virus or equivalent installed, operational, and with current virus definitions at all times.
-	ATF data will be password protected using a strong 8-character password.  The password will be changed every 60 days.
-	A hardware or software firewall will be used to protect the home computer.  Shields Up, grc.com, will be run at least every 6 months to assure the computer is sufficiently secure.  Zone Alarm or equivalent firewall software will be installed at the high protect level to assure the Contractor is aware of all program connections to the Internet.
-	Any persistent penetration attempts will be reported to the ATF Personnel Security Branch and the Information Systems Security Officer.
-	Any ATF information transmitted electronically to ATF will be encrypted through software provided by ATF or through other secure transmission methods as ATF shall implement.
-	Any configuration to be connected to ATF will be tested to assure there are no adverse affects on the LAN.
-	Access to the personal computer housing ATF data will be controlled.
-	All Contractors will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.
-	ATF data should be removed from the personal computer as soon as possible.  To assure the data cannot be recovered, ATF data must be purged (overwritten in accordance with ATF security requirements) after use.

Contractors will retain all notes and other investigative materials for 120 days after the report is submitted.  

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification which declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice and any supplemental material, whether submitted in hard copy or electronic format, represent actual reported investigative work that was performed and conducted in compliance with requirements of the Statement of Work.

Contractors must be a certified contractor in the Central Contractor Register (CCR), for payment via electronic funds transfer.  

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  There is an initial solicitation with a closing date of September 30, 2005.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) companies.     ATF’s objective is to provide a sufficient number of sources, geographically distributed, to ensure prompt and efficient performance of background investigations.  Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically add new contractors to the pool.  Therefore, ATF will retain offers received after the initial closing date and continually accept new responses for future consideration.  ATF will acknowledge receipt of offers and evaluate them for award when the need arises.

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses and provisions are incorporated and are to remain in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00) is incorporated by reference, applies to this acquisition.  Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 99) Evaluation.  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial.    A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 can be found on the web at http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/oa/oa52-212-3.doc or you may submit a request to siadministration@atf.gov.

EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the point payment rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 54 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.   At least 30 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 points must come from Vendor Qualifications. 

a.  Experience/Capabilities (45 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breath, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting investigations in the federal environment, experience conducting personnel security investigations (including overseas experience), and computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (30 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases.   (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should submit a current resume with his/her social security number, as well as all the requested information within the content of this solicitation. This solicitation will be open throughout the period of this BPA.  All proposals received after September 30, 2005 will be evaluated on a continual basis as needs dictate.  All responsible sources may submit an offer of interest throughout this time period.  Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  (No phone calls will be accepted).  

Proposals are to be submitted via mail to the Personnel Security Branch 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Room 2474, Washington, DC 20226, or via email to siadministration@atf.gov and must contain all of the required information.  Point of Contact: Chief, Personnel Security Branch.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Center for Coastal Studies for follow-on large whale disentanglement services.  Several species of endangered marine mammals are subject to entanglement in active and derelict commercial fishing gear.  The endangered species of most concern in the northeast region of the United States is the northern right whale.  The minimum population estimate upon which management actions are currently based is 300 animals for the Western North Atlantic stock of the northern right whale population.  Scaring patterns on known individual right whales indicate that a minimum of 72% of the remaining population exhibit signs of entanglement in fishing gear.  A second species of concern is the humpback whale.  Entanglement for these whales is the most prevalent human-induced take observed in the Northeast.  It is estimated that 50% of the humpback whales of the Gulf of Maine sub-stock bear scars from entanglements.  Disentanglement of a live whale from fishing gear is an extremely dangerous operation that may result in injury to the whale and those attempting to free it.  The goal of the National Marine Fisheries Service is to maintain a team of experts to respond to marine mammal entanglements and prevent entanglements from becoming fatal. The anticipated contract performance period is for one year plus zero option years.  The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Fiscal year 2005 funds have been directed by Congress to the Center for Coastal Studies.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710.  The size standard is 500 employees.  No award shall be made based on responses to this announcement as this is not a request for proposals.  Numbered note 11 applies.

On average, from one-quarter to one-third of the known population are identified in Cape Cod Bay and adjacent waters each winter and spring.  The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries began a Right Whale Conservation Program in 1997 based on an intensive surveillance and monitoring program that focuses on winter and spring months.  The intent of the contract is to conduct research to reduce the threats of human-induced mortality attributable to vessel collisions and entanglements, and to gain a better understanding of both the spatial and temporal distribution of individually identified right whales.  The statutory authority for this action is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source.  Congressionally mandated funding has been allocated for this advancement of right whale research and protection.  The anticipated performance period is for six months.  The applicable NAICS is 541620.  The size standard is $6 million.  No award shall be made based on responses to this notice since this is not a request for proposals.

FOR THE BIRCH BAYH U.S. COURTHOUSE, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA

Architect Engineer Services Solicitation #GS05P05GBC0001 Indianapolis, Indiana

The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in adaptive reuse architecture, historic preservation, mechanical and electrical engineering. Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Professional Services are required for the preservation, modernization and renovation of the Birch Bayh Courthouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. 

Through the preservation and modernization of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation. In accord with this tradition, the GSA Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values.  As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal Energy Goals and security requirements. All projects will be LEED-EB certified. 

The facility, designed by Rankin and Kellogg and built in 1905, is 459,121gross square feet and contains 373,876 rentable square feet. The structure is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is located in the heart of downtown Indianapolis, at 46 East Ohio Street. The project proposes to replace the roof, the flashing, and downspouts; upgrade the windows; upgrade toilet rooms to meet ADA and provide major alterations to mechanical, electrical, life safety, and plumbing systems, at the Birch Bayh U.S. Courthouse.  The project also includes preservation of many of the building’s historic mosaics, frescoes, and murals.  

The Estimated Construction Cost range of the project is $35 million to $45 million.  The scope of work may include, but is not limited to, the following: survey of the existing conditions; detail scope verification; presentations for client and historic preservation agencies; energy conservation analysis; complete architectural and engineering design; preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; value engineering; cost analysis; post construction contract services (PCCS); record drawings and construction phase A-E inspection services; and other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility. Throughout the design process, the selected A-E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally mandated cost limitation for the project. The construction contract is envisioned to be procured through a source selection process that will incorporate a base contract and options for those elements of work that can be executed within the congressionally mandate cost limitation. Drawings shall be created and submitted in native AutoCAD, latest release. Drawings created in other CAD programs and then translated into AutoCAD are not acceptable. Formatting for electronic drawings shall be per GSA standards. Specifications, reports, databases, and similar items shall be submitted in the latest MSOffice edition available at the time of contract award. The firm/joint venture shall update software versions at their own expense.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a modification to contract N61331-05-C-0029 with Intermed Video Technologies of Newtown, CT  for the procurement of three (3) additional 17” flat panel display and five (5) each 10.4” flat panel displays. This contract modification is required because recent completion of provisioning has identified the requirement for spare monitors. This requirement was only recently defined and was not known at the time the procurement quantities for contract N61331-05-C-0029 were established.  This item is only available from Intermed Video. Currently the flat panel displays, originally manufactured by Intermed Video, have been installed on some of the non-SLEP LCACs (pre-LCAC 61) and one of the NDI replacement LCACs (LCAC 61 and above). These displays, as previously installed, are integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the NDI replacement gear. Any other displays!  would require extensive testing and qualification costs, and duplicating the logistics train established for the non-SLEP LCACs. Intermed Video, as the OEM, is the only known source for this equipment. NAICS 334511 applies. FSC Code 5820.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is an independent federal agency charged with making recommendations to Congress and the Administration on issues, policies, and laws affecting people with disabilities. NCD is responsible for gathering information about the implementation, effectiveness, and impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

NCD's work in this area over the last three years has focused on identifying the problems or gaps in ADA implementation and on understanding what factors enhance or impede ADA implementation. In the 2003-2004 "Righting the ADA" project, NCD analyzed the effects of unfavorable Supreme Court interpretations in ADA cases, and developed legislative recommendations for restoring the ADA to its original intent. NCD is currently conducting an ADA Impact Study, gathering information about the impact of the ADA and determining whether the goals of the ADA are being achieved. Building on findings from this earlier work, NCD would like to bring together ADA stakeholders for input into developing recommendations on how to improve the implementation of the ADA and how to make the goals of the ADA a reality for individuals with disabilities. 

The contractor will establish a mechanism whereby ADA stakeholders, including individuals with disabilities, businesses, employers, state and local governments, and federal agencies, can have a national dialogue on ADA implementation and examine strategies for more effectively implementing the ADA. The contractor must demonstrate the ability to successfully identify, and reach out to, relevant stakeholders, to facilitate consensus building among groups with different perspectives and interests, and to assist NCD in developing an effective public information and awareness campaign. Based on the stakeholder input, the contractor will prepare a final report to contain specific recommendations for improving implementation of the ADA.

The estimated contract period is 12 months. NCD will distribute its Americans with Disabilities Act Implementation Project Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on May 15, 2005. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by June 20, 2005. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of May 15, 2005. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Julie Carroll, jcarroll@ncd.gov, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS:  This synopsis is two-fold and is as follows: (1) requests information in the form of a response from interested parties regarding their preferred contracting approach to the COSS follow-on; and (2) requests information on capabilities of potential offerors. Information received as a result of this notice will be considered by the Government and used for acquisition planning purposes only.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  II. RESPONSES REGARDING THE CONTRACTING APPROACH: The Government is soliciting unique and innovative contracting approaches to the Center Operations Support Services (COSS) follow-on contract or contracts that will enhance competition and provide business opportunities. Therefore, the Government requests that you respond with a business-case oriented toward a systematic and strategic contracting approach that takes into account segregating, packaging, and categorizing work requirements, and grouping and packaging logical functions that promotes synergism of work flow across contract(s) that will maximize customer value toward the COSS and Center Operations Directorate (COD) (here on referred to as "CenterOps") Vision Statements (see COSS Website) in order to deliver world-class service solutions.  In an attempt to determine the contracting approach for the COSS follow-on, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties (see I above) and asks that your response include information regarding, but not limited to, the following:  a) Management and Performance Structure: NASA JSC is interested in your perspective on a cross-functional management-performance concept in regard to your recommended contracting approaches/structures, taking into account vertical (top-down, bottom-up) and horizontal (end-to-end) orientation that will enhance lines of communication for work performance efficiencies, such as change management/control, performance synergies and integration activities of work-flows within and between contract(s), and cooperative lines of responsibilities and accountabilities.  b) Subcontract considerations: NASA JSC is interested in your perspective regarding your recommended contracting approaches/structures that consider subcontractor and supplier chain innovations, improvements, and opportunities that will enhance and allow for efficient supply-order delivery and turn-around, source availability, competition, and provide better business opportunities.  c) Socio-economic considerations: NASA JSC is interested in your perspective regarding your recommended contracting approaches/structures that consider socio-economic goals and set-aside recommendations (Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business, Small-Disadvantaged Business, or Women-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI), HUBZone small business) in order to provide Small Business and subcontractor solutions that will achieve NASA small business objectives and provide growth opportunities and development to emerging small businesses. d) Address what changes from the current COSS contract (NAS 9-01056) structure, if any, you would suggest for inclusion in the new COSS contract(s) and why?   e) Contract Types: NASA JSC is interested in your perspective on contract type(s). If you have experience with either a cost-reimbursement or firm-fixed-price type(s) of contract(s) in support of a Center Operations Services or similar contract, please provide your opinion, as well as the pros and cons of this contract type(s). Also, please provide your opinion on the contract type that was used for the current COSS Contract (NAS 9-01056).  f) Performance-Based Contracting (PBC): NASA JSC would be interested in your perspective on Performance-Based Contracting (PBC). If you have specific experience with PBC in support of a Center Operations Services or similar contract, please provide the pros and cons of PBC as well as your opinion of the type of work on the current COSS contract (NAS 9-01056) that may be best suited for this contract type. Please include your experience and opinion of measurable performance standards as it relates to PBC.  g) Contract Period of Performance Duration: NASA JSC would be interested in your perspective on how long the total contract period of performance should be.  h) Use of Award-Term: NASA JSC is interested in motivating contractors to provide excellent performance during the life of a contract through a new incentive plan called "Award-Term." This incentive is designed to foster long-term relationships by rewarding contractors with additional period(s) of performance in compensation for achieving desired objectives at a high level of performance and reduced costs in lieu of a traditional Award-Fee arrangement. Therefore, NASA JSC is considering the possibility of allowing the contractor to earn up to a 10-year period of performance without further competition.  It is important to note that Award-Terms are not the same as contract options. Award-Terms are earned based on contractor performance and cost savings; whereas, options are a unilateral right in a contract by which, for a specified time, the Government may elect to purchase additional supplies or services called for by the contract, or elect to extend the term of the contract.  NASA JSC is considering the use of a cost-plus-incentive fee structure to objectively evaluate cost, with an Award-Term Incentive to reward excellent technical performance. The Award- Term evaluation process mirrors that of Award-Fee; however, evaluations are to a greater extent based on objective metrics. A cost gate, that includes cost incentives, must be met in order to earn additional term.  NASA has utilized this new contracting approach in several cases under a pilot program. In an attempt to determine the feasibility of this approach for this particular procurement, the Government is soliciting input from interested parties and asks that responses include answers to the following questions:  1) Would Award-Term Incentive properly motivate contractor performance on the COSS follow-on contract(s) and why? 2) Would you submit a proposal if a solicitation is issued for the COSS follow-on contract(s) with the Award-Term Incentive and why? 3) What changes, if any, would you suggest to this incentive plan and why?  4) Have you had experience with Award-Term Contracting? If yes, please provide the name of the Government agency who awarded the contract, the contract number, a brief description of the work, the contracting officer's contact information, and your perception of how this incentivized/did not incentivize performance. i) Contract Content/Structure: Do you have any suggestions or examples of restructuring, simplifications, and clarity in statement of work language as well as other types of special clauses or additional information that would improve understanding or clarity of requirements and terms and conditions? j) Performance Standards: In order to evaluate the successful offeror's post-award performance, what factors should be taken into consideration by the Government?  k) Performance Incentives: Please provide your view regarding award fee and/or other appropriate incentives for contractor performance.  l) Data: What additional documents would you want to see on the COSS follow-on website (  	 http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/coss		) and included in the Technical Library?  III. POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES:  NASA JSC is also soliciting information about potential sources for the COSS follow-on as follows:  Response must include the following and should be limited to no more than 5 pages:  1) Name and address of firm. 2) Size of business. 3) Average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees. 4) Ownership. 5) Whether your company is Large business, Small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a)set-aside small business, HUBZone small business, Woman-owned small business concern, Veteran-owned Service Disabled small business, HBCU/MI, Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business. 6) Number of years in business. 7) Affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential team partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime). 8) List of customers covering the past 5 years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement. 9) Point of contact, address, and phone number.

<RESPDATE>083005
<ARCHDATE>08022006
<CONTACT>Ryan Parker Contracting Officer 2123633206114  ryan_parker@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service at the Statue of Liberty National Monument is issuing a solicitation (Request for Quotation - RFQ) for conducting an archeological site assessment for the site of the First and Second Pennsylvania Brigades Cantonment (1779-1780) at Morristown National Historical Park, Morristown, New Jersey. Funds are not currently available for this project.  This solicitation is being issued subject to the availability of funds. The project objective is to evaluate the structure and full extent of the cantonment and to identify specific locations of known and potential archeological resources including huts, roads, outbuildings, and special activity areas. Emphasis will be placed on geophysical survey of the site with limited ground-truthing of results. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), magnetometry (MAG), and electromagnetic conductivity (EM) will all be included as survey methods.  Results will be depicted in GIS and additional layers will be created to show site topography, surface features, and areas of past excavations. The solicitation and all attachments will be posted to the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about August 16, 2005.  The NAICS 2002 code for this project is 541720 with a size standard of six million dollars, ($6,000,000.00). The approximate 12 acre project area is located on the western face of Sugar Loaf Hill in Jockey Hollow in the vicinity of the five huts reconstructed in the 1960s. An overview of Jockey Hollow history and archeology is contained in the Morristown National Historical Park Archeological Overview and Assessment prepared as a component of the Integrated Cultural Resource Report by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst (University of Massachusetts 2001). The First and Second Pennsylvania Brigade project area was the subject of extensive archeological excavations conducted by Russell Baker in 1937, a project for which the field notes, report, and artifacts have been lost. A map survives which shows the location of C.C.C. structures at the site. Regional Archeologist John Cotter conducted an archeological survey of the project area prior to the reconstruction of huts in 1962 (Cotter 1962). Another assessment of this cantonment was conducted by Rutsch and Kim Peters (1975). A minor archeological compliance project was conducted in proximity to the huts by Steve Pendery (Pendery 1999).  Past archeology has focused on a core area on the western slope of Sugar Loaf Hill that contained surface evidence for hut fireplace rubble. The Rochfontaine map of 1780 shows the two brigades stretching across the slope well beyond the areas tested by subsurface work. However, the presence of a significant stone wall cutting across the north end of the excavated site raises the question whether it contains re-used hut foundation and fireplace stones. Cotter found ferrous artifacts in association with the huts, yet no metal detector or magnetometer work has occurred at the Pennsylvania Line to date.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates awarding a fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity multiple-year (base year, plus 4 option years) contract for new, trunked, land mobile radio (LMR) systems to provide communications for officer safety and institutional operations.  A typical configuration shall be a single site, trunked system, operating with-in UHF 406-420 MHz.  The system shall have multiple repeater channels and use a 3600 baud control channel or higher.  The trunked system shall dynamically and automatically assign a small number of frequencies to gain their maximum use.  Each system must be equipped with an emergency alarm notification that must be received and transmitted through the trunking control channel.  It is critical that immediate emergency notification be provided to a system dispatcher even when all voice channels are busy.  The equipment shall include radio frequency (RF) infrastructure equipment and subscriber radios.  Services will include:  project management, systems engineering, design, staging, site preparation/development, equipment installation and optimization, acceptance testing, and training.  In addition to infrastructure equipment, FBOP sites may require an equipment shelter of an adequate size to house the proposed infrastructure equipment and management terminals, as well as an adequate work space.  Infrastructure installation may also specify a provision for self-supporting tower (PiROD SU Series, or equivalent). In some instances, system installation may integrate an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  Site development could necessitate a generator to provide back up electrical power.

This requirement will include radio communications repair and maintenance services to support the critical operation of FBOP two-way radio communications assets.  This requirement must provide for the diagnostics, components, and technical services required for the restoration of defective radio equipment back to factory specified operating condition.  Prospective vendors must be capable of servicing existing digital, analog, conventional and trunked radio formats comprising of Motorola 3600 baud trunking infrastructure, conventional base stations, portable, mobile, and control products utilized by FBOP institutions, as well as the new equipment and systems proposed under this requirement.  Maintenance service will include, but not be limited to:  

1.  Handheld and mobile radio depot level repair and preventive maintenance;
2.  Annual system Survey and Analysis visits for infrastructure optimization;
3.  On-site response to system outages and restoration to system malfunctions on a 24/7 service window;
4.  Infrastructure circuit board and module repair;
5.  Nation-wide network monitoring and remote diagnostics;
6.  Telephone technical support; and 
7.  Centralized system management and on-site dispatch function to provide coordinated maintenance scheduling logistics support, engineering support, scheduling of all technical activities, and performance reporting on all scheduled and corrective maintenance activities provided to Institutions.

It is critical that each vendor, for this requirement, possess the capability to execute all equipment and service requirements.  Comprehensive procurement and maintenance of all assets, by one vendor, will provide the FBOP assurance that all equipment will operate reliably under all circumstances, while eliminating the possibility of non-compatibility between individually serviced equipment.  One vendor will ensure that the FBOP management of this program will not exceed current government work loads and resources.

Participation by small, small dis-advantaged, HUBZone small businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and severe disabled veteran-owned businesses is encouraged.   Faith-based and Community-based Organizations have the right to submit offers/bids equally with other organizations for contracts for which they are eligible.  To be considered, firms must have at least five (5) years experience with projects of similar scope.  Failure to identify all site personnel and provide requisite resumes may disqualify an Offeror from further consideration or result in a lower technical score.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers and are, with the exception of price, listed in descending order of importance:  past performance (descending order of subfactors: Past Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment to Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), technical (descending order of subfactors: Technical Capabilities, Proposed Key Organization and Key Personnel, Quality Control/Quality Assurance, and Corporate Resources and Ability to Effectively Manage the Contract, with the following sub/subfactors:  Corporate or Company Resources dedicated specifically to the management of this contract; Staff Training Program to include technical, health and safety, and supervisory training; Recruiting and Retention Plan; Health and Safety Plan; and Drug Free Workplace Policy), small business subcontracting, and price.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Business Subcontracting.

In accordance with FAR 9.104-1, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with Offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.  Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated by the Government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  The Government reserves the right to award to one or more vendors who will be selected for award on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each technical proposal will be evaluated qualitatively and categorized as in relation to the evaluation factors set forth in this solicitation.  A finding of Unacceptable in one technical factor may result in the entire technical proposal being found to be unacceptable.  Technical and past performance, when combined, is significantly more important than cost or price.  Prospective Offerors are forewarned that an acceptable technical proposal and marginal past performance (if included as a factor) with the lowest price may not be selected if award to a higher-priced proposal affords the Government the best value.  The Government may elect to pay a premium price to select an Offeror whose non-cost/price evaluation factors (e.g., technical and past performance, if included) are superior.

This agency will consider all proposals submitted by responsible sources.   The solicitation, which includes instructions for submitting a quote, will be available on or about 
August 29, 2005.   This solicitation is unrestricted.  Point of Contact of inquiries and clarifications is Laurie L. Williams, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, 320 
First Street, NW., Rm. 500-6, Washington, D.C. 20534.  The point of contact can be reached at (202) 307-0954 and fax number (202) 616-6055.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No telephone calls for solicitation requests will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined Synoposis/Solicitation.  Solicitation to be posted separately on 2 Aug 05.  An export consultant will utilize existing tools, skills, data, knowledge, and past experience to provide Region 10 Forest Management with the ability to estimate current (or average) export log values (fob/fas SE Alaska Log Transfer Facility, LTF) for each USFS cruise log grade by species, small end diameter class, and geographic area (if practicable). Consultant will determine which data summaries and tables would best meet Region 10 Forest Management’s immediate needs for short term export analysis. Consultant will recommend data collection studies, update processes, or forest measurement changes that would increase resolution for long term export valuation.

1) Provide data summaries and tables displaying export log sort volume percentages and current (or average) export net dollar values (fob/fas SE Alaska LTF) per Net MBF (Scribner west-side) for each USFS cruise log grade (based on 32 ft. log lengths and various small end diameter classes) by species (SS, H, WRC, AYC) and geographic area (i.e., south Tongass, central Tongass, west Tongass, and north Tongass), if practicable. Explain analysis assumptions and use limitations of short term export values. Estimated hours = 80.  Deliverables = Include tables and limitations in Phase 1 Export Analysis  Report.
 
2). Provide a list of recommendations for a long term export valuation strategy (to be implemented in Phase 2), including data collection studies (i.e., dual scale log tests), export value update processes (who, what, when, where, and how), and forest measurement changes (i.e., USFS cruise grade adjustments to capture volumes of higher value export log sorts). Estimated hours = 40.  Deliverables = Include list of recommendations for long term export valuation strategy in Phase 1 Export Analysis Report.

Although the above tasks primarily involve computer work, the consultant will need to travel to Juneau, Alaska to meet periodically (two times between 9/1/05 and 11/30/05 and one time in 12/05) with Region 10 Forest Management staff to assure deliverables meet Forest Management’s needs.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Adil Felloussi, Tangier-Mediterranean Special Agency, Immeuble Mamounia, 5éme étage, Place Moulay El Hassan BP 408, Rabat, Morocco Phone: +212 (0) 37 66 19 83, Fax: +212 (0) 37 66 19 84. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance in port security related to International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and Container Security Initiative (CSI) compliance for Tangier-Mediterranean port complex in Morocco.

Morocco is an emerging market economy at the crossroads of Europe, Africa and the Middle East that imports $11 billion worth of goods each year.  The country has embraced economic reforms over the past decade and a policy of openness, which has led to free trade agreements with both the United States and the European Union (EU).  To take advantage of these arrangements, the Government of Morocco (GOM) is fully committed to improving the country’s trading infrastructure.  As one of the premier emerging economies in the North Africa/Middle East region, an improved transportation infrastructure, including secure ports and supply chains, is necessary not only to ensure the safe transport of goods and people, but also to guarantee that new economic development in the tourism and industrial sectors is not delayed by transportation bottlenecks.    

Considered as one of the highest priorities of the Moroccan Kingdom, the Tangier-Mediterranean port complex (Tangier-Med) encompasses an area of 500km2 that has been promoted to a special development zone status.  Its particular position on the Straits of Gibraltar, at the crossing of two major maritime routes, and 15km from the EU, will enable Tangier-Med to serve a market of hundreds of millions of consumers through its industrial and commercial free zones.  It will also win part of the strong growth market of container transshipment, including becoming the leading hub for cereal transshipment, for which there are no facilities in the northwest Africa region at present.  To ensure the success of this port complex, the Grantee needs Technical Assistance to meet international port security and safety compliance standards.

Tangier-Med will consist of a deep sea harbor; a 90 ha logistics free zone adjacent to the harbor; a 600 ha industrial free zone 20 km from the harbor; and a customs processing center 15 km from the harbor.  In order to link the port and free zones to the Moroccan economic fabric, the GOM is constructing connecting infrastructures to serve these development areas; namely, a 61 km new segment of the highway to connect the harbor to the Casablanca-Tangier highway, a 45 km railroad, and express regional road lanes.     

Tangier-Med will have important economic effects in terms of jobs, creation of added value and foreign investment.  In addition to the economic effects of the operation of the port complex, there will be important effects resulting from its construction, particularly through foreign investments, and from the operation of the free zones (direct and indirect added value, direct gains, jobs and foreign investment).  The accompanying transportation infrastructure (roads and rail) will greatly improve the accessibility of the Northern Provinces to the rest of the Kingdom.  Ensuring a high level of security and safety at the port complex is regarded as an important condition and a critical success factor for Tangier-Med’s success.  It is also critical for the foreign investors and producers to leverage the area’s free trade zones as a point of export to the EU, the United States and/or Asia.  This Technical Assistance would design security and safety programs specific to Tangier-Med that are compliant with the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), and Container Security Initiative (CSI).  The Technical Assistance would also assist the Grantee in developing tender documents for the procurement of safety and security equipment and services, as well as a strategy for the acquisition and payment of such equipment and services. 

The Technical Assistance consultant will conduct: 1) Review of Existing Studies and Documents; 2) Risk Analysis; 3) Security and Safety Alternatives; 4) Security and Safety Action Plan; 5)  Procurement Plan and Documents; and 6) Final Report. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $374,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  .  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 12:00 noon, September 5, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

   The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study on a large-scale joint-venture refinery and petrochemical complex in the Shuangdao Bay area in the northeastern region of China

In the past decade, the Dalian Shide Group (DSG), located in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, has become a world-scale PVC converter.  The company, founded in 1992 as a machinery engineering and construction company, is a growing regional conglomerate that specializes in the fabrication of chemical building materials, electrical appliances and other activities.  Revenues in 2004 were approximately $2 billion.  DSG has partnered with Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) for the implementation of this project. The potential captive off-take of its raw material needs and the co-production of other plastics and resins, will allow Dalian to secure some of its own raw material needs while at the same time open opportunities for further business diversification and expansion.   
As noted, DSG has teamed with the SABIC for this project.  Since its establishment in 1976, SABIC has grown into a major international petrochemicals firm.  In 2003, SABIC produced 42 million tons of petrochemicals, giving it revenues in excess of  $12 billion.  SABIC’s role, in addition to sharing development costs to date with DSG and provision of equity capital, is to provide the required crude oil feedstock and petrochemical production expertise.  
This project will be one of the largest refinery petrochemical projects in China and internationally.  Given the current and forecasted explosive growth rate in the building materials market in China, the desire of Dalian to back integrate into petrochemical raw materials is viewed as a logical and rational strategy.  The sponsors have presented Project Application Report (PAR) for the Shuangdao Bay refinery and  petrochemical complex to the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC).
A key issue is to base economic analyses on individual product price forecasts and detailed analysis of the market supply and demand for both the domestic Chinese and regional international markets.  Thus the purpose and objectives of the proposed study are to expand and refine the existing PAR to:
a)	Incorporate the best international technology into the design and implementation of the project;
b)	Develop Feasibility Study that is helpful to meet the new requirements of the NDRC approval process; 
c)	Evaluate project economics and financing facing an increasingly competitive marketplace; and
d)	Develop a Feasibility Study consistent with the needs and requirements of targeted and potential international financing sources.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a US$871,673 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This modification hereby changes the Response date to August 29, 2005.

The Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research to locate sources and information on commercially-available exposure matrices in Support of Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.  The DOL does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Source Sought notice or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this request.  This Sources Sought notice is being issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  The DOL is attempting to identify sources and features of commercially exposure matrices in Support of Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, possibly for four years.  A draft copy of the Statement of Work has been included  for information purposes only.  All information received in response to this notice will not be returned.  A response to this request may be submitted in any format, including standard marketing information.  Each company submitting information must include:  company name, point of contact, address, telephone number, e-mail address, capabilities statement, General Services Administration schedule information, business size, pricing, and any comments or suggestions.  Information is requested by  August 29, 2005 and can be submitted to the Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Administration and Management, Attn:  Paula Miller-Sheelor, Contract Specialist, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-5416, Washington, DC 20210 or via e-mail to Sheelor.Paula@dol.gov.  Statement of Work for Exposure Matrices in Support of  Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program.  I.  Background:  Public Law 106-398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) of 2000, as amended (the Act), established a program to compensate nuclear weapons program workers who suffered adverse health effects from exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards in the course of their nuclear weapons program-related work.  The President, in an Executive Order dated December 7, 2000, assigned program implementation responsibilities to various executive departments.  The Fiscal Year 2005 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Bush on October 28, 2004, abolished Part D of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act administered by the Department of Energy (DOE) and replaced it with a new system of federal payments called Part E to be administered by the Department of Labor (DOL).

The Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC) has responsibilities under Part E of the EEOICPA to issue decisions concerning whether certain employees of DOE contractors or subcontractors contracted occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to toxic substances in the work environment.  It is essential that DEEOIC have accurate, timely, and useful information regarding the toxic substances used at DOE sites throughout the United States.  The DEEOIC currently has records from DOE related to:  DOE Former Worker Programs (i.e. needs assessments), site reports (i.e. Tiger Team Reports, Environment Safety and Health reports, site history reports), operational safety procedures, environmental impact reports, job descriptions/labor categories, exposure assessment reports, accident investigation reports, field logs, emergency management plans, lists of chemicals utilized at the sites, industrial hygiene records and epidemiological studies. 

The challenges to developing useful data to identify exposures are considerable.  Many of the records do not exist or are not retrievable; some facilities no longer exist and the documentation has been archived; most sites had thousands of toxic substances present.  Data may be available from DOE Headquarters, DOE field sites, the Former Worker Program, as well as other locations.  Data sources may include industrial hygiene records, occupational medicine records, epidemiology data, personnel records, union records, etc.

The data currently maintained and the additional data that will be identified and obtained by the Contractor will be used by Claims Examiners to conduct research of DOE facilities and uranium mines and mills as an informational tool to assist with adjudication of claims under the Act.  This information will be used to validate information obtained from DOE or from the claimants.

The successful Contractor will have extensive institutional knowledge of the current and historical operations performed at the DOE facilities, uranium mines and mills, and be able to relate toxic exposures to this information.  The Contractor must have access or the ability to gain access to documents and/or data that identify the toxic substances used in specific sites.  This may include an established contractual relationship with subcontractors such as the Former Worker Program.  Some of this information may be classified and may include data covered under the Privacy Act.  The Contractor must have a security clearance with DOE or the ability to obtain a clearance.

II. SCOPE OF WORK 
The Contractor shall analyze and enhance the current data provided by DEEOIC.  The Contractor shall research additional sites, identify the data collection tools/locations, and provide recommendations to the DEEOIC as to which order the sites should be developed.  The DEEOIC will review and approve the order of research.  The contractor shall provide recommendations for records that should be utilized for the exposure matrices and develop the data input.

The Contractor shall research and identify occupations at covered DOE sites, building numbers where particular types of work was performed, and the toxic substances present at the sites.  The Contractor shall further identify the timeframes during which particular toxic substances were present and the diseases related to those toxic substances.  

The Contractor shall establish a Quality Control procedures for validating data.

Question:	Where will other meetings be held?

Response:  Verification of tenant requirements will be at the site.  Other  meetings with GSA & A/E may be held in Washington D.C.  Major Submission Meetings, typically include participation from the following:
	-CMc reps
	-PM
	-VE Staff
	-Estimating Staff
	-Field Operations
	-Principal and PM

Question:	What is the level of documentation expected from the A-E at each submittal stage?

Response:  The A-E will build from the scope, and will submit the following at each submission stage, including:
	a.   Investigate Site
b.   Verify Scope
a.	Report Out
b.	Cost Estimate
c.	Phasing Plan
d.	Schedule Plan

From these schedules, the CMc will give their input.  The CMc will verify estimating services the A-E provides.

Question:	Who controls A-E Submissions & Level of Submissions?  Who keeps the Design & Scope on schedule?

Response:	CMc is responsible to keep the schedule on-track.  The ultimate responsibility if the scope/schedule should slip will be that of GSA.  However, the CMc will be responsible to provide recommendations/concerns regarding the scope & schedule and report them in a timely manner to GSA.  GSA will enforce the A-E to act and proceed according to schedule.

Question:	Will the CMc do their own cost estimate or will they verify that of the A-E’s?

Response:	The CMc will analyze and verify the A/E’s cost estimate. The cost estimate must not exceed the project’s budget.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the A-E regarding the schedule and phasing of the project?

Response:	Yes, it will be a collaborative effort of all parties.

Question:	How will scope be controlled?  What about “Tenant Improvement” work?

Response:	Scope will be developed during the Concept Stage.  The CMc will be participating in this stage to help define the scope so that changes will be minimized as the project progresses.  There is no tenant improvement work currently included in the scope; however, such work may arise as the project progresses.

Question:	What is the contingency for the project?

Response:	 GSA will have a small contingency during the Design & Construction Phases; however, the CMc SHOULD NOT RELY ON THESE FUNDS BECAUSE THE A/E AND THE CMc WILL BE SELECTED ON DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION EXCELLENCE CRITERIA.

Question:	The CMc will have a higher confidence level should the A-E provide the level of detail needed.  However, what happens if unforeseen site conditions arise?

Response:	GSA WILL NOT request funds for escalation. The Budget must be met.

Question:	Is the ECCA closer to $30 million or $40 million.

Response:  Addressed in the RFP. The Estimate Construction Cost at Award is $36,000.000.

Question:	Will the four (4) Partnering Meetings be held in Washington D.C. or Indianapolis?

Response:	Partnering Sessions will be held in Indianapolis so that tenants can attend.

Question:	Commissioning Services- where do they start/end in regards to the CMc’s own commissioning services?

Response:	Panos Giannakopouls reads an excerpt from the draft RFP for 3rd Party Commissioning. 
•	The Commissioning Plan shall be provided by the Commissioning Agency
•	The Commissioning Agency shall conduct a focused review of te design prior to the construction document phase to ensure that each commissioned feature of system meets the owner’s requirements relative to functionality, energy performance, maintainability, system cost, indoor environmental quality, and local environmental impacts.
•	The Commissioning Authority must sufficiently observe installation of each type of commissioned feature to ensure that they are properly installed according to the contract documents and manufacturer’s instructions, and that other building components are not compromising the performance of the feature.
•	After the contractor completes the start-up and initial checkout of all items listed in the contract documents, the C. Agency applies appropriate techniques to verify that start-up and initial checkout of all commissioned equipment is successfully completed.
•	The C. Agency is to review and approve the contractor’s Testing & Balancing Contractor functional testing plan prior to the start of testing.
•	The C. Agency is to receive, review, and compile all General Contractor submittals.

Question:	The RFP indicates that the 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will perform mechanical/HVAC services only.  Is this true?

Response:	The 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide a commissioning plan, address lighting, environmental responsiveness and energy efficiency, HVAC, fire alarm system, sprinkler system, and LEED Commissioning.  GSA will clarify CMc’s scope regarding commissioning services.

Question:	Is there a duplication of commissioning services?  Commissioning should start during Design to gain a LEED point.  Refer to page 1-24, 4.35-“provide coordination.”

Response:	 3rd Party Commissioning Agent will provide the Commissioning Plan & Testing.  The CMc will do the work; the 3rd Party will observe, test, and verify.  GSA will clarify in amended RFP.

Question:	Is there swing space available?

Response:	There has been some space identified by building management and the previous A-E in the basement.  Some storage will also be converted into swing space.  This needs to be done to accommodate tenants.  GSA is aware that some tenants prefer not to move into this space.

Question:	Will the CMc work with the Building Manager to communicate and address tenant concerns?

Response:	During the Construction phase, the A-E as well as the CMc must have a Tenant Coordinator/Liaison.

Question:	Who will actually move fixtures, furniture, etc?

Response:	The CMc

Question:	Are there funds set-aside for security issues?  U.S. Marshall’s Services (USMS)?

Response:	Some funds are included in the project for guards.  USMS will fund aspects of the project according to their own agency requirements.

Question:	Will the GSA Building Manager be the communication point of contact between the CMc and the tenants?

Response:	Yes.

Question:	How many courtrooms are being renovated?

Response:	None.  No renovation of rooms- just Fire Alarm & Sprinkler systems.

Question:	What if the judge refuses to have fire protection and window replacement in their chambers?  Is there a requirement to make tenants comply?

Response:	We will comply with code.  GSA has a very stringent Fire & Life Safety (FLS) branch that is very involved in the project.  They will ensure that the project will be executed according to code.  They will take a firm responsibility that the code will be enforced.  All tenants will have to participate and comply.  The work will be done after-hours.  Planning is the key to success.

Question:	Are Security Clearances done through Homeland Security?

Response:	Yes.  It is the Contractor’s responsibility (A-E, CMc, CM, sub-contractors) to submit documents and obtain clearance.  Contractors need to be mindful that clearance takes time.

Question:	The RFP states that the selected CMc for pre-construction services will have the option to go to the construction phase.  Is this true?

Response:	Yes.  This is an option that GSA may choose to exercise.

Question:	Clarification needed for page 1-9 regarding: FY2005 Funds vs. Optional work.

Response:	GSA will provide the A-E’s schedule of submission.  It will be provided through an amended RFP or through meeting minutes.

Question:	Is the bonding requirement submitted at bid or at the construction phase?

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE: Philadelphia Area New National Cemetery; RFI: VA-786A-05-RI-0005 Landscape Architecture (NAICS 541320) firm capable to preparing a Master Plan, all design development documentation, schematics, construction documents, construction period services and site visits for Phase I of the new Philadelphia Area National Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The proposed acquisition is a 100% Small Business set-aside. Prime contractor shall have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm or team, with experience in planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreation facilities, or similar land development projects. The following licensed/registered specialty disciplines shall be members of the firm, or team which demonstrate expertise in their respective fields: Civil Engineer, Natural Resources Specialist, Water Management/Irrigation specialist and Architect. This project is to be divided into two contractual phases: Phase I is the development and completion of a Master Plan, to the schematic design level, for the entire cemetery facility, and Design Development design and study reports for the Phase I Development area. Phase II shall be exercised at the option of the government to prepare construction documents, drawings and specifications for all site work, buildings and features contained in Phase I development of the cemetery. The overall goal of the Master Plan is to provide approximately 169,500 interment spaces within the entire cemetery plus the buildings, roads, etc. described below to meet the needs for burials through year 2040. The goal of the Phase I Development is to develop approximately 16,000 gravesites for casket interments including 13,500 pre-placed crypts, 9,000-niche columbarium(s) and 1,500 in-ground sites for cremated remains, and a garden for scattering cremated remains. This first phase will include a fast-track burial area, with temporary administrative and maintenance facilities, a temporary committal shelter, minimal roads, utilities and irrigation system. Ultimately, the total Phase I project will develop approximately 65 acres to provide for approximately a ten-year inventory of gravesites to accommodate burials through year 2017. In addition to gravesite development, the construction includes an entrance area, flag and assembly area, four committal service shelters, public information center with restrooms, administration and maintenance complex, roads, utilities, signage, site furnishings, fencing, and landscape planting. It is the intent of the VA to use very basic conceptual layouts by NCA staff (to be furnished to the A/E) as the starting point for the design. Development of a Master Plan for a new national cemetery in the Philadelphia area includes the Environmental Assessment (EA) as the initial step in VA capital facilities planning. Copies of preliminary EA1 will be provided to selected A/E team. The Department of Veterans Affairs considers the total environmental approach a necessity to good master planning. The planning process must be founded upon a sound understanding of the features and dynamics of the environment. The selected cemetery site is composed of a variety of components: topography, soils, plant communities, wildlife habitats, riparian features, etc. Each component must be understood and interpreted as a contributing element to the natural functioning and development of the site. The existing landscape must be an integral part of the plan. The goal of the Master Plan is to provide an orderly, professional, and aesthetic development plan for the entire cemetery site of approximately 250 acres. The completed Master Plan will consist of the required drawings, details, studies and reports of all the elements listed in this Scope of Work and in the revised A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects. The completed Master Plan should be sufficiently detailed to enable the Department of Veterans Affairs to proceed directly into the preparation of Schematics and Design Development Drawings for the Phase I development and for future development phases of the cemetery. The Master Plan for the Philadelphia Area National Cemetery will include the design and location of the following: Entrance Area; Public Information Center with Cortege Assembly Area and Rest Rooms (900 gsf); Administration and Maintenance Complex, with service yard and parking; Flag Assembly Area; Memorial Walkway and Donations Area; Committal Service Shelters (2); Roadway System and Parking; Cremated Remains-approximately 1,500 in-ground cremains, garden niche or terrace sites, approximately 9,000 columbarium(s) niches, and garden for scattering of cremated remains; Grading, Drainage, and Plantings; Utility Distribution Systems; Irrigation System; Avenue of Flags; Veterans Memorial; Carillon Tower Location The schematics and design development will include all appropriate architectural and engineering disciplines and a firm estimate of construction cost. The construction documents and construction period services shall be awarded at the option of the government. In addition to design capabilities, emphasis will be placed on the estimating capabilities of the applicants.

WDFW's preliminary assessment of Morse Creek indicates several options withing the 6.2 river mile cooidor have potential for the construction of temporary acclimation/rearing ponds that will support an out-of-basin rearing program, and provide a safe haven to preserve the genetic integrity of the listed stock.  WDFW has already realeased Elwha River chinnook samon yearlings into Morse Creek this year at no cost to the government.  However, to ensure that future releases return as adults at a high rate to Morse Creek, holding ponds must be developed prior to releases occurring in 2006 and later.  The WDRW possesses the needed fish and is obligated buy the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries to maintain the population.  WDFW gained the expert knowledge and experience in rasing and transporting Elwha River chinook salmon since the Rearing Channel operation began in 1975.  WDFW also has on staff the necessary engineering and fish health expertise to respond to any contingency in the Morse Creek Program.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by submitting descriptive literature illustrating capabilities to provide the required services.  All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon respoonses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining wheather to conduct a competitive procurement.  Questions may be e-mailed to Kim_glass@nps.gov.  Telephone questions or requests will not be accepted or acknowledged.  End of Announcement.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Essex Cryogenics of Missouri for 12 stainless steel air sampling cylinders for the long-term storage of compressed air.  NOAA will use these cylinders in their research on the global distribution and trends of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric trace species.  The cylinder requirements are as follows:  1) Internal Volume – 25-40 liters; 2) Material – 304 stainless-steel; 3) Service Pressure – 900 psia (or greater); 4) DOT Certification - period of at least 5 years; 5) Valve – DOT-approved, stainless steel valve with metal seat and stem; 6) Internal Surface – chemically inert (electro-polished or Summa treated to near-mirror finish); and 7) Cleaning – halogen-free cleaning (no chlorinated solvents).  The interior finish of the cylinder is most critical to NOAA’s research.  DOT approval means that a cylinder can be transported containing approximately 20 times more air than one that is not DOT-approved.  Essex Cryogenics is the only company that manufactures a stainless steel sampling cylinder approved and certified by the Department of Transportation (DOT).  These cylinders were developed by Essex through the cooperative efforts between Essex engineers and scientists from NOAA and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Anticipated award date August 18, 2005.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to radar technology and/or products that will reduce the vulnerability of aircraft to Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and update the current procedures with modern technology.  The system would be used at airfields in all types of operating environments, home station and deployed.  System should have an operating temperature range of -25 to 125 F and a storage range of -80 to 160 F to be usable at all of the current locations.  Also, system is able to withstand exposure to harsh weather environments, to include but not limited to, sand, rain, snow and freezing rain.  One objective of this initiative is to determine to what extent a FOD radar can meet or exceed the environmental constraints imposed by today’s operating environments.  Specific desired operational characteristics of the FOD radar system include the following: system should be capable of detecting objects 10 mm in size; system should not produce any interference with other operating systems; system should be deployable and easily installed on airfield; and the system should use an available power source.  Through this RFI, the Air Force is requesting information concerning emerging technologies for FOD radar.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued to conduct market research for informational and planning purposes only. This market survey is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements of Contractor Logistics Support Group or 327th Aircraft Sustainment Wing (327TH ASW/CLSG) located at Tinker AFB, OK 73145 for the services related to Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the C-26B/RC-26B aircraft.  The C26B/RC-26B is a militarized version of the FAA-type certificated Fairchild SA227-DC aircraft.  The aircraft is powered by twin Honeywell TPE331-12UA-701G turboprop engines.  The current fleet consists of 22 aircraft, 11 Air National Guard (ANG), and 11 Army National Guard (ARNG).  The aircraft are currently based at 19 CONUS and 1 OCONUS locations (see below).  The ARNG (C-26B) mission is to provide time-sensitive movement of personnel and cargo, as well as limited medical evacuation.  The ANG (RC-26B) aircraft have been modified as counter-drug support aircraft carrying specialized electronic equipment to provide aerial surveillance and reconnaissance for law enforcement agencies.  The aircraft Main Operating Base (MOB) locations are provided below.  The MOB locations for the ANG are: Fresno ANGB, CA; Clarksburg, WV; Jacksonville, FL; Kirtland AFB, NM; Meridian MS; Houston, TX; Syracuse, NY; Fairchild AFB, WA; Tucson, AZ; Madison, WI; and Montgomery, AL.  The MOB locations for the ARNG are: Clarksburg, WV; Wheeler AF, HI; Madison, WI; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Buckley ANGB, CO; Dobbins AFB, GA; Rickenbacker ANGB, OH; Otis ANGB, MA; Columbia, SC; Little Rock, AR; and Ft Belvoir, VA.  A summary of CLS services to be provided includes all support actions required for operating and maintaining the aircraft, aircraft subsystems, and support equipment.  The CLS system includes all aircraft maintenance and inspections, launch and recovery of the aircraft, supply of all contractor owned spares and unique support equipment through a Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS); repair and overhaul of all repairable spares at Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified repair stations; maintenance and repair of all support equipment; aircraft paint; propeller and engine repair/overhaul.  These actions include supply, procurement, production control, quality control, component failure reports, and acquisition of commercial data.  The Contractor provides for additional support, as over and above tasks, engineering services including development, test and FAA certification of modifications, installation of modifications,  depot maintenance support, field team support (worldwide), aircraft crash investigations and damage repair.  The Contractor also provides information for: quality, contract funds status, consumption and usage, service engineering reports, subscription services for technical manual updates and service actions.  The contractor is to establish and maintain agreements with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) for data and technical support necessary to maintain the C-26B/RC-26B aircraft.  The contractor shall provide personnel, material, and technical and maintenance support for the aircraft in accordance with FAA standards to maintain FAA-type certification.  The contractor shall establish maintenance and supply support at each aircraft site to satisfy the stated Mission Capability Requirements.  Additionally, the contractor shall support the planned utilization rates shown below and be prepared to provide flying hours support up to II0 hours per month as shown in the Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs).  The ARNG Operational Support Airlift (OSA) C-26B fleet and the ANG CD RC-26B fleet must each meet a monthly Mission Capability (MC) rate of not less than 85%, of which 80% must be Fully Mission Capable (FMC).  MC rate is defined as the total reportable hours in a month less total hours an aircraft is not available for operational use while it is undergoing maintenance or awaiting a part, divided by the total reportable hours in a month.  The planned NORM/MAX utilization rates for the ANG Counter Drug (CD) aircraft are 42/65 Hrs/Month and 500/550 Hrs/Year.  The planned NORM/MAX utilization rates for the ARNG (OSA) aircraft are 60/75 Hrs/Month and 720/900 Hrs/Year.  Although the C-26B/RC-26B is a public use aircraft, the contractor shall maintain the fleet in accordance with (IAW) FAA-approved maintenance standards to maintain its FAA-type certification.  Any off-equipment maintenance that exceeds maintenance capabilities at the MOB shall be accomplished at Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 FAA-certified repair stations.  Non-certified Counter-Drug specific equipment shall be maintained using the appropriate vendor data and Government furnished manuals.  The Government will provide fuel for the aircraft and support equipment.  All other aircraft and support equipment, petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) items shall be furnished by the contractor.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT.   1.  SCOPE.       a.  The U.S. Air Force Security Assistance Training Squadron (AFSAT), Systems Management Division, at Randolph AFB, TX, seeks qualified sources capable of providing a full range of C-130 aircrew training services to include, but not be limited to, ground-based academics, simulator, and actual flight instruction applicable to the Lockheed Martin L-100/C-130 Hercules type transport aircraft.  Training will be required on a regular and continuing basis for various international Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers in support of their C-130 operations.  This effort can be expected to consist of instructing at least 100-150 personnel annually (primarily pilots, flight engineers, and loadmasters, with a lesser number of navigators).       b.  It is preferable that respondents be willing/able to directly provide all necessary training services, training devices, aircraft assets, and other required materials/equipment needed to satisfy all aspects of the requirement.  However, if this is not feasible, respondents are expected to be capable/willing to act as a single point “integrator,” using sub-contractors to satisfy those areas of training/facility/equipment that they, as prime, cannot meet.  All training activities are expected to be accomplished at the contractor/sub-contractor’s commercial training facilities in the Continental United States (CONUS).  (Note:  In the event neither the prime or sub can provide appropriate aircraft assets to support in-flight training, it may be possible to request the foreign government make its own aircraft available for training.  Under such a scenario, respondent(s) would be expected to deploy qualified instructor personnel in-country on a temporary basis.  All operating and servicing costs while the aircraft is being used for training would occur at customer expense.  This, of course, would be addressed on a case-by-case basis, if/when the situation arises.)       c.  Unless otherwise specified, assume all instruction and technical information will be presented at the unclassified level and delivered under the auspices of the U.S. Security Assistance Training Program.  All international military students will be fluent in English with no requirement for language translation during training.  Contractor-formatted training courseware may be utilized if it is equivalent to military training standards (as determined by AFSAT), or access to appropriate  government-furnished training curricula and/or syllabi may be made available.      	d.  Required training will normally be transition-type (conversion) training oriented toward an existing aviation skill set.  This includes required ground school, flight simulator, and flying instruction.  Aircrew students will normally have prior experience as pilots, co-pilots, flight engineers, navigators, and/or loadmasters on some type of aircraft other than a C-130.  Upon completion of training, they are expected to be capable of performing all functions normally required for their stated crew position in the C-130.  Typically, the highest demand for training is likely to be in support of the C-130 B/E/H models, although training may occasionally be required in support of other C-130 variants, as well.  Types of training shall include, but are not limited to:    (1)  Initial conversion and refresher ground school academics,     (2)  Initial conversion and refresher ground-based simulator training,    (3) Initial conversion & refresher in-flight instructional training,     (4) Aircrew instructor upgrade training, and     (5) Mission qualification training.    The contractor will verify and document satisfactory completion of training for each student through testing and exercises, and provide evidence of such to AFSAT.     e.  Training specifics/requirements (nationalities, numbers of students, crew positions, training objectives, desired competencies etc.) will be identified/funded on an individual task order basis, as training needs are identified.  Respondents will be expected to provide necessary classroom academics, practical exercises using appropriate training devices, and inflight instructional training in the actual aircraft.  Flight training devices (i.e., simulators) will be used to enhance ground academics and serve as a transition from ground training to the flight training phase.  The fidelity of the flight training device must replicate C-130 systems and flying characteristics with a sufficient level necessary to achieve the training objective.  It is highly desired that the phase just prior to C-130 flight training use a high-fidelity, motion-based C-130 flight simulator with a Federal Aviation Administration “Level C” (or higher) simulation certification or equivalence.  Consideration will be given to alternative training concepts that employ flight simulation training devices of lesser fidelity if such training approaches can be adequately justified and/or demonstrated to be equivalent in nature.       f.  All aircrew instructors shall be qualified in their particular crew position and have prior experience instructing L-100 /C-130 academics and in-flight procedures.  Additionally, prior military service is highly desirable.     g.  Respondents may occasionally be required to provide lodging and/or ground transportation for foreign military students attending training in CONUS.       2.  REQUIRED RESPONSE INFORMATION.     a.  Responses to this announcement will be used to identify interested, qualified, capable sources with proven and/or high confidence ability to deliver and support a complete C-130 aircrew training program using commercially-available training assets.     b.  Interested parties who believe they have the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities  should submit technical capabilities in writing.  Please include a point of contact, telephone, fax and e-mail address.  Responses should include sufficient detail to illustrate the respondents ability to support required training and define, as specifically as possible, the approach expected to be employed to deliver this training and achieve the desired results.      c.  Details with respect to past experience in the provision of similar flight training or related air services contracts is a firm requirement for any response and should be sufficiently detailed so as to illustrate their relative level of scope.  Include a description of the services provided, customer(s), location(s), period(s) of performance, and customer contact information we may use to verify such experience.       d.  All aircraft, flight simulators, training devices, and support facilities owned and/or expected to be made available by respondent in support of this training should be clearly identified with respect to make, model, condition, quantity, and location.     e.  Respondent(s) are encouraged to identify any aspects of this training effort that are considered especially high risk or unlikely to be supportable, as currently defined.  This information, along with any constructive work-arounds or alternative training concepts that may be suggested, will help determine the overall feasibility of sourcing this training via commercial  means.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), soliciting industry interest in conducting research in technologies supporting Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard have defined MDA to be the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment of the United States.
MDA is the collection, fusion, and dissemination of enormous quantities of data — intelligence and information — drawn from U.S. joint forces, U.S. government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  Eventually, the depth of information collected from these various sources will be weaved together to enrich a comprehensive common operating picture (COP) that is envisioned to be fully distributed among users with access to data that is appropriately classified.
The purpose of MDA is to generate actionable intelligence.  Without actionable intelligence, counterterrorist or maritime law enforcement operations are seldom fruitful.  The challenge will be to effectively integrate and fuse the various inputs to achieve the synergies offered by a comprehensive situational awareness picture, while being responsive to the information needs of participating agencies. 
Research is expected to be funded by a variety of United States Government agencies between Fiscal Year 2006-2009.  NRL is specifically interested in leveraging efforts and technology of vendors that are currently under contract for MDA by any United States Government agency.  Vendors interested in participating in this research program should submit a letter of interest including the following information: a) Name of current program b) Government contract number c) Government Program Manager contact information d) Vendor Point of Contact e) Summary of effort (four paragraph maximum).  Submissions at higher classification levels can be arranged upon request.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source Notice
<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract for the annual service of Direct Digital Controls/Energy Management Control System to Beale AFB, California as a direct award to Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  The contractor will provide all management, tools, supplies, equipment and labor on all Apogee Insight installed systems.  This solicitation is a sole source award under FAR 6.302-1.  

Siemens has been the current contractor for the DDC/EMCS system at Beale AFB since 21 March 2003.  Market research has established Siemens as the only known capable company, which can provide building automation to fulfill the Beale AFB requirement. 

The DDC at Beale AFB is an Apogee Insight system manufactured solely by Siemens Building Technologies, Inc.  Siemens has no authorized distributors.  Beale AFB currently has 60 facilities, with 22,000 points and 80-field panels on-line with this system.  The Apogee Insight system (hardware and software is proprietary in nature).  In order to maintain coordinated system growth, consistency and lower training costs, all DDC support system procurement must be Apogee Insight.  This requirement is part of that upgrade.  Therefore, it is not in the government’s best interest to introduce a potentially new contractor during this transition.  A new contractor could result in untimely delays of service and potential man-hours lost in training.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334512.  The small business standard is 500 employees.  The entire solicitation will be released as “other than full and open” solely on the Electronic Posting System (EPS), www.eps.gov, (paper copies will not be available).  This award is based on the availability of funds before September 30, 2005.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development, Fabrication, Testing and Validation of Forensic Analysis Techniques
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to negotiate with the University of Colorado at Denver (UCD), Campus Box 129, and P.O. Box 173364, Denver, CO for the development, fabrication, testing and validation of forensic analysis techniques.    BACKGROUND: The mission of NIST’s Electromagnetics Division includes providing methods of measuring and mapping magnetic fields for various analysis requirements.  To this end, the Magnetic Recording Metrology Project of the division is devoted to investigating methods of high-resolution imaging of fields above magnetic recording media. This imaging has applications in both data storage technology as well as forensic analysis of the samples. In addition to this work, the Magnetic Recording Metrology Project receives other-agency support to investigate related problems in magnetic data storage evaluation.  This other agency work supports NIST’s efforts on magnetic field metrology.  SCOPE: The specific work described here is to carry out a key component of NIST’s contract with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to build prototype magnetic imaging systems for forensic analysis. This project supports the broader NIST internally supported Competence Program in Magnetic Sensors. The scope of the work will be to construct, as an integrated project, real time systems for forensic analysis of cassette, Digital Audio Tape (DAT), and Digital Data Storage (DDS) tape for the FBI and conduct validation studies using samples provided by the FBI.  Arrays of magnetoresistive (MR) elements will be used to detect stray fields from the tapes. UCD will fabricate large linear arrays (256 element) of Nickel-Iron alloy magneto-resistive arrays in the cleanroom at NIST in Boulder, CO. UCD will be responsible for integrating the arrays with custom multiplexing electronics and mechanical tape transport systems, for each different format, to allow investigators to visualize the magnetic patterns on the tapes as it slides past the sensors. These designs will include, but not be limited to, development of a 4 mm wide, offset array that is compatible with the digital audio tape format and a 13 mm wide version that is compatible with video tape format. The sensors should obtain the strength of the magnetic field perpendicular to the tape at a nominal distance of 5 micrometers, with a signal to noise ratio of 40 dB. In addition, UCD will conduct validation studies for the FBI. These studies will be done on-site in the NIST laboratory located in Boulder, Colorado and in collaboration with the FBI to ensure independent verification of blind studies and tests.   PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The contract to be negotiated is for a 36 month study. SOLE SOURCE: NIST has determined that UCD is the only contractor that can provide the technical expertise necessary to carry out this work.  The Magnetics Team at the Physics Department at UCD is uniquely qualified to carry out the completion of a realtime magnetic imaging system that is compatible with both analog cassette and digital audio tapes.  NIST requires a Team with these minimum skills: (1) proficient at using the NIST Object Oriented Magnetic Modeling Framework to analyze the magnetic response of micro- and nano-scale magnetic elements; (2) able to quickly develop the computer software to directly create computer files from the Object Oriented Magnetic Modeling Framework for input into the NIST-Boulder mask design software (XIC) needed to create the reticle masks for device fabrication , (3) able to develop,  troubleshoot, and conduct a fabrication process from conception to completion, from scratch, in the NIST cleanroom. Fabrication is to be on 3” silicon wafers, and includes 500 nm liftoff process, ion mill, reactive ion etching, photolithography, and chemical vapor deposition of silicon dioxide, (4) a proven track record of designing and fabricating magnetic arrays of at least 64 elements on a 64 micron pitch, (5) the Team must be proficient in the area of: (a) anisotropic magnetic sensors, (b) magnetic force microscopy, (c) Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometry, (d) Vibrating Sample magnetometry, (e) and making ultra-soft amorphous magnetic alloys. The Magnetics Team at UCD is uniquely qualified to carry out this specific component of the FBI supported work.  The UCD Team has the required experience described above and has worked on this and related projects for the past 5 years, with over 20 combined years experience in the NIST cleanroom. This is not a formal solicitation.   This notice may represent the only notice. See note 22.

The goal is to protect human subjects, yet address many of the “sticking points” that researchers encounter when they seek approval from an IRB.  The document shall cover such issues as minimum risk, informed consent, prison inmates as a protected class, privacy/confidentiality, and HIPAA rules that may govern research.   Serve as a resource person to the NIJ Ethics Officer and anyone else within NIJ on these issues; (3) Work on a paper on the subject of experimental methods that explains alternate methods to random assignment to avoid problems in selection bias. While the experimental method is considered the “gold standard,” there has been a lot of methods development in the past two decades that have yielded considerable understanding in how to come as close as possible to experimental results using a quasi-experimental design. There are situations either where it is unethical or impractical to apply experimental methods. In many cases, researchers start a random assignment design only to find out later that selection pressures have compromised the design. These latter cases are called “broken experiments.” Since this is a very technical literature, it is not accessible to many researchers. The work shall not only explain the methods, but provides code in SAS and STATA to show how to use these methods; (4) Assist NIJ staff on the technical aspects of spatial regression.  Provide further training within the National Institute of Justice on when and how to use these methods.   Advise NIJ staff on ArcGis9 and how to use generic mapping techniques; (5) As long as NIJ continues to fund the research subcommittee meeting of the Association of State Correctional Administrators (ASCA), advise them on the technical merits of new and cutting edge research in corrections, as well as assist them in evaluating research that comes to their attention; (6) Provide technical feedback on the Abt Associates, Inc. and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) analysis of the cost/benefit of prison privatization of the BOP’s Taft facility; (7) Be available as a resource to any other NIJ and Office of Justice Program’s staff, to include the other divisions within NIJ/ORE, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention; and (8) Mentor some of the students who work at NIJ.  The following clauses  apply to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items(Only the winning vendor must complete this certification prior to award); and 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions–Commercial Items.  There are no addenda to these clauses. The following clauses are also applicable: 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items and 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors–Commercial and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items. The evaluation criteria and basis for this purchase order award will be the technical capability and qualifications of offeror, and price, listed in descending order of importance.    Technical capability and qualifications are more important than price.  However, the importance of price will increase if the proposals are relatively equal with regard to technical capability.  In this cost price may become the determining factor.  Interested small business offerors located within 50 miles of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area shall submit the following to the Contracting Officer: (1) a resume and brief (five page or less) technical proposal / capability statement; and (2) a price proposal including their fully loaded labor rate on a labor-hour basis – no reimbursable travel costs are anticipated.  Offers must be written.  Neither oral or facsimile offers will be accepted.  Offerors may submit their quotations by either mail or E-mail no later than 2:00 pm EDT on August 10, 2005.  Please reference the solicitation number on your offer.   Offerors should use overnight or messenger service as our first class mail delivery is not reliable.

<DESC>General Services Administration, Region 8, Federal Technology Services, Network Services Division, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the following services:  

Product Requirement Description:

GSA Region 8 has a requirement for non-personal services for local network exchange access and off-premise switching telecommunication service in all six (6) GSA Region 8 states.  Services will be required at numerous locations (see location list below) throughout the six state service area.   The purposed contract is for two (2) years with three (3) one-year options.  The local exchange service provider, herein referred to as “offerors”, shall provide local telecommunication service at all of the GSA customer locations in Wyoming, Montana, North and South Dakota, Colorado (excluding the Denver MAA footprint) and Utah (excluding the Salt Lake City MAA footprint), replacing the existing Circuit Switched services (CSS) and Dedicated Transmission Service (DTS) service.
Circuit Switched Services (CSS) include Local Voice Service (LVS) and Circuit Switched Data Services (CSDS).  LVS includes business line service, off-premises switch-based voice service, access to key systems, and access to Private Branch Exchange (PBX) systems.  Business line service provides a customer with a single voice-grade telephonic communications channel that can be used to place or receive one call at a time.  CSDS includes ISDN business line service, ISDN off-premises switched-base voice, ISDN access to key and PBX systems, ISDN BRI and ISDN PRI service.  This service also provides connection of a customer single station set or a facsimile machine to the public switched telecommunications network.
Dedicated Transmission Service (DTS) includes local DTS and DTS access to an Inter-Exchange Carrier Point of Presence (IXC POP).  Local DTS provides dedicated connections between customer locations within a local dialing area.  This includes connection between two customer locations via DTS.  DTS access to an IXC POP is the dedicated connection between a customer organization location and an IXC.  This includes access from a local switching system (PBX or Key System) to an FTS POP (example; Sprint, MCI, etc.). 

Off-premise voice grade telecommunications internal and external system switch and local and long distance network access herein defined as “Dial Tone”. Dial Tone is a single line service delivered to a customer/Government provided telephone, facsimile machine, modem, key system, hybrid PBX or equipment with various switching features.  Features include but may not be limited to:  intercom, call forward busy, call forward no answer, call transfer, toll restriction, call hold, call forward variable inside or outside of the system, 6 way conferencing, 3 way conferencing, incoming and outgoing caller ID, out going caller ID blocking, 900 call restriction, ANI suppression, speed calling individual / group, voice messaging equipment.  The contract will also provide for service and access to the local commercial network, intra LATA and inter LATA commercial long distance vendor networks, local and long distance Government provided long distance networks and access to government provided or vendor provided voice messaging systems or equipment. This includes PIC (Primary Inter-exchange Carrier) and LPIC (Local Primary Inter-exchange Carrier) access to MCI (0222) or Sprint (0333) FTS 2001 Network carriers.  The contract will include MAC’s (moves, adds and changes) for Dial Tone lines and features on a per unit, fee basis.

The offerors shall provide the local loop (including local switching and associated features), local transport between terminating locations within the City/ State service area, access to local long distance services, and access to and from inter-exchange carriers. The Contactor shall also provide dedicated circuits between sites within the City/State service areas as well as between a GSA customer site and an IXC POP.

Dial Tone lines will be installed initially and on an on-going basis as needed at multiple locations within City/State service areas.  Facilities are required to have expansion for growth.  The contract will require:  Redundancy, load-sharing circuits, power backup, on-line diagnostics, with equipment and service engineered to provide a 99.99 % reliability. The services will include full switching system maintenance including wire maintenance up to the minimum point of presence at each user’s premise at no additional charge.  In addition loop extensions, installation and maintenance, up to and including the terminating jack in the customers premises are required as part of this contract.  The offerors shall provide a toll-free trouble reporting number that is available on a 24/7 basis.

The offerors will also provide for upgrading the existing service as required, new technology as it becomes available, and provide expanded services such as industry standard DSL, ISDN-BRI, VoIP and IP telephony.

2. CONTRACT OBJECTIVE.  
SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development: The Contractor shall assist the PAD and USAJFKSWCS by conducting the piloting and modification of SF Junior Leader 360 survey, preparation of survey utilization monographs, validation research documentation, and preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey feedback instruments. The goal of SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development is to generate reliable, valid, and efficiently manageable 360-degree surveys and feedback instrumentation unique to Special Forces for use in implementing the SF LEADER 360 Program.
3.  REQUIREMENTS.
3.1. SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the piloting and modification as well as the preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey is a multi-rater assessment instrument where targeted leaders rate themselves and are rated by superiors, peers and subordinates on knowledge, skills and attributes essential for success as an SF leader.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development involves several phases of work to include Pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, preparing supportive validation research reports, and final operational feedback instrumentation development. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, while primarily targeted to Captains during their team leader time, may also be targeted to Warrant Officers and Majors during their tenure as assistant team leaders and company commanders.  Work may take place at all DoD posts and NG installations CONUS or OCONUS that serve as locations for SF units, including pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey with a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
3.2. Survey Development Timelines. This represents a close-ended contract that will end on 1 October 2005. During the duration of this contract the following major tasks will be accomplished: Completion of an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey focusing on Team Leaders and Company Commanders, to include survey pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument, preparation of a utilization monograph, complete supportive validation research reports, finalize all feedback instrumentation, and complete an operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey.  The Contractor will be required to provide sufficient developers and administrative support personnel to insure delivery of the final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey by 1 October 2005. 
4.  TASKS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.
4.1.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development. The Contractor completes the development of an SF unique operational edition of an SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey for use in the SF LEADER 360 Implementation Program.  Contractor responsibility for the completion of development of SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey involves the following subtasks:
4.1.1	   SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey data reports development.  Item and scale information derived from the 360 instrument results must be reflected effectively in reports that facilitate the feedback process, which is the key component to any 360-degree feedback program.  The contractor is responsible for developing clear, coherent reports that make maximal use of instrument data for purposes of providing effective feedback to developing leaders.  Report content and design is developed in conjunction with the consultation to the target group, subject matter experts in the area of developmental feedback, and other subject matter experts knowledgeable in the area of 360-instrument development and execution.  The contractor is responsible for conducting meetings with critical individuals and panel groups to ensure that the end product is useful to both the target of the 360 instrument and to the professionals who will be tasked to use the reports in their respective developmental programs.  
4.1.2.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey pilot testing and pilot version modification and completion of initial operational version of the instrument.  Once an initial pilot version of the 360 instrument is developed, pilot testing of the instrument on a subset of potential targets is necessary to allow for final revisions of items sets, scales, and reports prior to initiating the use of the instrument in regular practice.  Pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey will include a representative sample population of active duty and National Guard SF units.  
The data obtained from the pilot testing provides the necessary data to improve and streamline item sets and instrument length pursuant to the development of a more efficient and effective instrument.  Pilot testing is required for any instrument prior to any formal introduction of an instrument for routine use.   
4.2.   SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Modification. Based on an analysis of the information and data gathered during the piloting process, modifications will be made to the instrument and a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey will be prepared along with all supportive documentation necessary to implement the use of the instrument.  The Contractor shall make modifications to The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey to maintain currency and relevance to the tasks and requirements of leadership in the units the instrument serves.  Changes in mission profiles and doctrine occur over time and must be reflected in the content of 360 instruments.  An example is the midcourse revisions made on the SF Senior Leader 360 following the initiation of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  Critical task behaviors demonstrated by successful leaders in operations in Afghanistan and Iraq have required a re-evaluation of the item sets and general content that needed to be reflected in a relevant, current instrument for SF leaders.  Consequently, substantial revisions of items and scales were made in the SF Senior Leader 360 instrument prior to pilot testing.  All developmental instruments require periodic review and update to maintain relevance and efficacy.  The contractor shall be required to re-evaluate the relevance of existing instrument versions periodically as directed by the Government to ensure that developmental instruments remain optimally effective.
4.3.  SF Junior leader 360-degree Survey Documentation/Reports: The Contractor shall provide both verbal and written assessments of instrument efficacy and accuracy.  Verbal assessments will be presented to the Psychological Applications Directorate, USASOC, appropriate leadership at the USAJFKSWCS, and any other command or development entity as directed by the Government representative.  The contractor shall schedule and arrange of all necessary travel, schedule the coordination of panel membership and conduct of these and other subject matter panel meetings, keep all records from all panel meetings, manage the initial data related to item and scale development and management and analysis of pilot testing related data.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for the design and development of reports and briefs to command elements and other government representatives and their respective offices. The Contractor will assist pilot testing participants in understanding their Feedback Report and gather data on participants’ perceptions of the pilot SF 360s. Modifications to the Feedback Report may be required based upon participant perceptions of it clarity and effectiveness.
4.4.  The contractor will provide a technical manual that describes, at a minimum, the following:
	a.  Instrument development process
	b.  Descriptions of the scales and what meaning should be ascribed to the scales during feedback.
	c.  The technical processes involved in administering the instrument, entering data from the instrument, scoring the instrument, and report preparation.
	d.  Guidance (i.e. "do's and don'ts") on how to most effectively provide feedback to officers.
	e.  Information from the data collection and pilot testing process regarding general concerns in Special Forces.  For example, information or training would best prepare a leader for team, company, battalion and group command that could be presented during the MOS phase of the qualification course or in appropriate level pre-command courses.
	f.  A briefing that could be modified for presentation to selection boards or command that summarizes "a", "b" and "e" above.
4.5.  The contractor will provide a 1/2 to 1 day (depending on the needs of the psychologist customers) workshop on effective use of the SF 360 instruments.  The training materials used by the contractor in the conduct of this workshop shall become the property of the government.

Evaluation Section:  
1.     GENERAL.  The Government will award the contract to the offeror whose offer represents the best value to the Government on the basis of (1) Technical  (2) Past Performance and (3) PRICE, as explained below.
2.     Technical.  The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value.
a.  Approach to completion of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, to include a proposed timeline for completion.   
b.  Method for providing Quality Control over daily work performance and procedures for corrective action.
c.  Special Benefits.
3.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether or not they believe:  (1) that the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.
4.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained.
5.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical Capability to be more important than Past Performance or  Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.  However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the marginal differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision, below.
6.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.

SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development: The Contractor shall assist the PAD and USAJFKSWCS by conducting the development, piloting, validation and modification of SF Junior Leader 360 survey; preparation of survey utilization monographs; validation research documentation, and preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey feedback instruments. The goal of SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development is to generate reliable, valid, and efficiently managed 360-degree surveys and feedback instrumentation unique to SF.  3.  REQUIREMENTS.  3.1. SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development.  The Contractor shall be responsible for the development, piloting, validation and modification as well as the preparation of a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey is a multi-rater assessment instrument designed to allow targeted leaders to rate themselves, while also being rated by superiors, peers and subordinates on knowledge, skills and attributes essential for success as an SF leader.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development involves several phases of work to include final development of survey items, pilot testing, and pilot version modification resulting in completion of an operational version of the instrument; preparation of a utilization monograph; preparing supportive validation research reports; and final operational feedback instrument development. The SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, while primarily targeted to Captains during their team leader time, may also be targeted to Warrant Officers and Majors during their tenure as assistant team leaders and company commanders, respectively.  Work may take place at all DoD posts and NG installations in the continental United States and outside the United States that serve as locations for SF units.  The government expects that focus group work and pilot testing of developing versions of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey will take place with a representative sample population of active duty and NG SF soldiers at their units.  The locations of the active duty SF units are Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Fort Carson, Colorado; Ft Lewis, Washington; and Fort Campbell, Kentucky.  NG SF Units are headquartered in Alabama and Utah.  Overseas locations include Stuttgart, Germany and Okinawa, Japan.   3.2. Survey Development Timeline. This work effort represents a 6-month contract beginning with award of the contract.  4.  TASKS  4.1.  SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey Development. The Contractor will produce a unique operational SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey focusing on Team Leaders and Company Cdrs, for use in the SF LEADER 360 implementation Program.  Contractor responsibility for the completion of development of SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey involves (but are not limited to) the following subtasks: 4.1.1 Survey item development using focus groups made up of a representative sample of SF soldiers.  There currently exist approximately 150 draft items arranged in proposed scales that were drafted during an earlier project.  4.1.2 Initial survey pilot testing and pilot version modification based on feedback from SF users. Once an initial pilot version of the 360 instrument is developed, pilot testing of the instrument on a subset of potential targets is necessary to allow for final revisions of items, scales, and reports prior to initiating the use of the instrument in regular practice.  Pilot testing of a final draft version of the SF Jr. Leader 360-degree survey will include a representative sample population of active duty and NG SF units.  4.1.3 Statistical studies to evaluate item and scale reliability and validity.  4.1.4 Completion of an operational version of the instrument and final pilot testing on a sample of at least 30-35 SF junior leaders. Based on an analysis of the information and data gathered during the piloting process, modifications will be made to the instrument and a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree Survey will be prepared along with all supportive documentation necessary to implement the use of the instrument.  4.1.5 Complete feedback report forms and instruments. Item and scale information derived from the 360 instrument results must be reflected in reports that facilitate the feedback process, which is the key component to any 360-degree feedback program.  The contractor is responsible for developing clear, coherent reports that make maximal use of instrument data for purposes of providing effective feedback to developing leaders.  Report content and design is developed in conjunction with the consultation to the target group, subject matter experts in the area of developmental feedback, and other subject matter experts knowledgeable in the area of 360-instrument development and execution.  The contractor is responsible for conducting meetings with critical individuals and panel groups to ensure that the end product is useful to both the target of the 360 instrument and to the professionals who will be tasked to use the reports in their respective developmental programs.  The contractor will use the Senior SF Leader 360 Survey report as a model for what will be developed for the junior SF Leader 360 Survey report.  4.1.6 Complete a final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey.  4.2 The Contractor shall provide sufficient developers and administrative support personnel to insure delivery of the final operational version of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey within 6 months of contract award.  4.3 The contractor shall identify target leaders and raters for each prospective target in such a way that the population of all possible targets is adequately represented.  The piloting and sampling process shall be conducted in consultation with, and require approval from, the contracting officer’s technical representative (COTR).  4.4 The contractor shall use the government’s web-based survey administration program (Special Operations Command Assessment System – SOCAS) to collect pilot survey data.  This requirement may be modified in consultation with the COTR if an acceptable automated survey program that operates within the command’s intranet environment is provided by the contractor.  The contract personnel will require appropriate clearances necessary for access to the command’s intranet.  4.5 The standard for 360-degree survey feedback is, and will maintain, personalized, one-on-one feedback provided to each target leader by an appropriately credentialed psychologist.

The Government will assess the technical capability of each offeror on the following areas.   a.  Approach to completion of the SF Junior Leader 360-degree survey, to include.  Detailed outline of project requirements.  A proposed timeline for completion of each phase.  Identification of the level of support – the numbers and types/skill levels of personnel to be utilized. b.

Special Benefits.  The Contractor should provide information on any aspect of their company that they believe offers desirable qualities not directly required in the Statement of Work.   The Government will NOT assess capability on a pass/fail basis, but will use its assessments of capability as a basis for comparing offerors to determine best value. 3.  Past Performance.  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which an offeror satisfied its customers in the past and complied with Federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  The Government will contact some of each offeror's customers to ask whether they believe:  (1) the offeror was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offeror's performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during performance; and (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance the Government will contact some of the references provided by the offeror and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  Federal, state and local government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic data bases.  The Government will not evaluate an offeror's organizational past performance on the basis of the personal past performance of the offeror's key personnel.  The Government may evaluate the organizational past performance of the offeror's proposed key subcontractors.   4.  Price.  The Government will evaluate the reasonableness of the price of each acceptable offer in relation to the offeror's relative capability.  Price will be evaluated on the basis of price analysis if adequate competition is obtained. 5.    Relative Importance of the Evaluation Factors.  Nonprice evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  The Government considers an offeror's Technical Capability to be more important than Past Performance or Price.  The elements of Technical are in descending order of importance.   However, the Government will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The relative influence that capability and price will have on the source selection will depend on the differences among the competing offerors.  See Source Selection Decision.  6.   Source Selection Decision.  In order to select the winning offeror, the Government will rank the offerors from best to worst.  If one offeror has both the better capability and the lower price, then that offeror will be the better value.  If one offeror has the better capability and the higher price, then the source selection authority will decide whether the difference in capability is worth the difference in price.  If the source selection authority considers the better capability to be worth the higher price, then the more capable, higher-priced offeror will be the better value.  If not, then the less capable, lower-priced offeror will be the better value.  The Source Selection Authority will continue to make paired comparisons until he or she has decided which offeror represents the best value.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is a sole source notice constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Requirement for 52 each Fiber Optic Bypass Switches (P/N H-AS-FORELAY-60) from Systran Corp (doing business as Curtiss Wright Controls), Dayton, OH.	Competition is impractical for the following reasons: After reviewing other vendors product Systran was the only vendor that had a fiber optic bypass switch that met the specifications of our existing telemetry processing requirements. These switches are critical to our launch operations.  NASA KSC Launch Services Program uses SYSTRAN Corporation’s Scramnet+ cards to create a ring that simulates a common data buffer between the various components in our telemetry system.  The addition of Optical Bypass Switches to our telemetry system will allow the removal or addition of nodes from the Scramnet+ ring as required during the operation of our telemetry system. The SYSTRAN Corporation’s Optical Bypass Switch (part number H-AS-FORELAY-60)  is the only switch that interfaces directly with each Scramnet+ card by use of a mini DIN cable .  This direct interface between the Scramnet+ card and the optical bypass switch provides two abilities that are necessary to minimize the corruption of data in the event of a failure of a component on the Scramnet ring: 1.	The ability for a Scramnet card to quickly remove itself from the Scramnet ring if its internal programming detects a failure within the Scramnet card.  2.	The ability of our in-house health monitoring software applications to remove a component from the Scramnet ring if it detects an error in the functioning of a component.  3.	The ability to command the bypass switch directly from the Scramnet card using our own in-house software applications.  This will allow us to programmatically add a backup for a failed component onto the Scramnet ring.  Systran Corporation’s Optical Bypass Switch (part number H-AS-FORELAY-60) is the only compatible switch that interfaces directly with the Scramnet cards that are presently part of our telemetry system.  The direct interface between the optical bypass switch and the Scramnet+ card is required to meet our telemetry system requirements. This determination was made after an extensive canvassing of various technology industry personnel for alternative suppliers and yielded no other competitive suppliers of the referenced product.  It is in the best interest of NASA to sole source this procurement to Systran who has the only standard product that meets all requirements.  The provisions and clauses in this solicitation are those in effect through FAC 2005-05. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code (541330) and the small business size standard for this procurement is four million dollars.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer of mission suitability, which shall be considered by the agency.  However, based on the information above, the government does not anticipate any offers other than Systran's that can meet the requirements. Delivery to KSC.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by , 2:00PM. EST on August 8, 2005 to OP-LS, KSC, FL 32899, solicitation number PR4200119604, FOB destination to KSC, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>There are three (3) purposes for this Amendment #5.  The first purpose is to provide an alternate fax number (in addition to the 202-772-9729 fax number already provided) for proposals/quotes.  The alternate fax number is 202-205-3204.    

The second purpose is to correct one of the answers posted in Amendment #3 (with revised language in ALL CAPS below):  

Can you provide examples (attachments) of the paperwork you require the mediators to fill out?  Do you have standard forms that you use for the referral, for the settlement agreement, and the required evaluation?  

The awardee will provide mediation services to DHS Headquarters as well as organizational COMPONENTS such as Coast Guard, ICE, etc. As such, each organization has THEIR internal form for settlement agreement and evaluation.  These particulars will be discussed after the award is made and will not be made available before such time.

The third purpose is to answer several questions that were received by the 7/26 3:00 (EST) deadline but were inadvertently not included in Amendment #3, posted yesterday.  

Those questions/answers are as follows:  

The Statement of Work says the contractor will ensure that accommodations are available. If a mediation takes place in a location to which the mediator must travel, will DHS reimburse rental expenses or provide a space for the mediation? If the contractor is providing space for mediation will parties to the mediation travel to contractor's office for a mediation?    

DHS will work with the contractor to mutually agree on a space for mediation.  If DHS space is not available, the DHS organizational element will make appropriate arrangements through their internal channels to secure space and notify the contractor.   SINCE DHS WILL BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SUCH CHARGES, VENDORS SHOULD NOT INCLUDE SUCH CHARGES IN THEIR PROPOSALS.     
 
Will space for the mediation be provided by DHS? If not, will the contractor be required to rent space for the mediation?  

See Answer Above.
 
What is the estimated number of hours required per mediation?   

Varies by Case.  

AS STATED IN AMENDMENT #3, QUOTATIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 4:00 P.M. (EST) ON MONDAY, AUGUST 8, 2005.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

INDONESIA

	Indonesia is rich in coal deposits and has the potential to become the world’s largest coal exporter.  Having total coal reserves of over 36 billion tons, Indonesia is presently the world’s third largest exporter of thermal coal after Australia and China.  During the last seven years, coal production increased an average of 12.9 percent per year.  Around 30 percent of the total production was for the domestic market and the rest for export.  While domestic coal consumption is expected to grow by 10 percent annually through 2009, coal exports are rising by 15 percent annually to supply Indonesia’s primary markets in Japan, Taiwan and Korea.  To promote investment and expansion in this sector, the government is proposing a new law to allow foreign investors to co-invest with the state-owned mining companies or with regional state companies.  Indonesia expects that there will be $17 billion in new investment, which could generate over $1 billion in potential U.S. export opportunities over the next three years.

At present, there are 45 coal mining companies operating throughout Indonesia; major coal companies that likely have project opportunities are PT Adaro Indonesia (PT AI), PT Bumi Resources (PT BR), PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (PT BA) and PT Kideco Java Agung (PT KJA).  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is the key government entity in charge of mining development in Indonesia.


PHILIPPINES

	About 30 percent of the Philippines' total land area is rich in mineral deposits.  The country currently has 37 on-going exploration or development projects for gold, copper, nickel, chromium and other precious metals.  In 2004, the Philippine government launched the Minerals Action Plan to revitalize the mining industry while addressing safety, environmental protection, and socio-economic development issues.  To encourage foreign investment, the government passed a law to allow 100 percent foreign ownership in Philippine companies and offered several other new incentives.  The country expects $5 billion of investment in the mining sector through 2012.

	The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is responsible for realizing mining sector development in the Philippines, with the support of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, the Board of Investments, and the Chamber of Mines.  Major local players in the mining sector are Lepanto Mining Corporation, Philex Mining Corporation, and Semirara Mining Corporation.  


 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.
 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Government of Romania (GOR) has made great strides in developing the country’s framework for information technology growth.  As the country prepares to join the European Union (EU), the GOR has introduced various initiatives aimed at improving interconnectivity, efficiency in industrial operations, and increasing IT access for the general populace.  Recently the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced a strategic objective for the country to complete its transition to an “Information Society” by 2008.  This initiative is supported by President Basescu, who believes that an aggressive IT strategy for the country with increased IT integration will lead to new e-Government initiatives, which will in turn create a more transparent government. 

In response to the growing push by the GOR for greater interconnectivity and increased IT access for the general populace, USTDA has been asked to consider the following projects in the IT sector.  The DM consultant will not only evaluate the projects listed below, but will also consider any other opportunities in the IT sector that may benefit from USTDA funding.

§	Ministry of Finance - Proposal for a technical assistance project to develop a new tax database to help with tracking, and to develop an integrated IT system to manage old and new information.  

§	Ministry of Communications and Information Technology – An interconnectivity integration project, creating an integrated IT system between the various ministries within the government.  The project would serve as a pilot program that could eventually be expanded to integrate schools, libraries, and local governments into one database.

The DM consultant will determine the economic feasibility of the proposed projects and evaluate the projects according to USTDA criteria.  The DM consultant will make recommendations for USTDA funding and would draft TORs and budgets for any recommended projects.  

The DM will meet with various financial institutions to determine the availability of financing for these projects.  The DM will also consider the environmental impact of each project and recommend mechanisms to mitigate/minimize these impacts and to measure the environmental benefits from implementing the proposed projects.  The projects as proposed to USTDA are primarily focused on the upgrade and integration of IT systems; nevertheless, the DM consultant would need to review all aspects of the proposed projects to assure that no adverse effects to the environment are expected. 

The selected consultant will need to be an IT expert with experience designing secure IT systems for government use.  The consultant will also need to be familiar with the latest integration software and be able to design sophisticated IT infrastructure systems that incorporate legacy systems.  The DM will require at a minimum one week of travel to Romania.

 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantie social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing market entry problems and/or strong competition from foreign companies, which often receive subsidies, and other support from their governments.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Romania recently suffered from severe flooding due to a dam breakage on the Timis River, where several towns were flooded and lives were lost.  As a result of the floods, the country’s vulnerabilities in terms of emergency response efforts were exposed.  The same situation occurred in Macedonia as a result of excessive rain, which exerted too much pressure on old dams, causing them to break and flood entire regions of the country.  Macedonia is exploring areas where they may be able to cooperate with their neighbors to respond to such natural disasters.

Poland, like much of the region, experiences many of the same natural disasters.  The Ministry of Interior in Poland has established a command and control center to handle national emergencies; however, the municipal governments of Warsaw, Gdansk, Gdynia, and Sopot would like to establish an IEMS.  These municipal governments are working with a U.S. firm to bring this combined proposal to USTDA for funding consideration.  
Poland and Romania are both new members of NATO, and both are striving to meet higher security standards placed upon them by the European Union (EU).  While Romania has yet to join the EU like Poland, it too is struggling to enact new EU legislation guaranteeing the security of Romania in the context of greater Europe.  It is imperative for these two countries to be able to handle man-made and natural disasters in a timely manner and to coordinate their responses with neighboring countries.  Most notably the capital cities within each country would like to develop an IEMS to coordinate emergency response activities on a local, regional, and national level.
Macedonia, on the other hand, while not a member of NATO or the EU, suffers from catastrophic earthquakes and flooding and is in desperate need to develop a mechanism for responding to such disasters.  Most of the natural disasters that occur in Macedonia are shared by Bulgaria, as they share a common border along a very active fault line.  The Government of Macedonia has expressed an interest in developing an emergency response system that could effectively respond to these types of emergencies and mitigate the dangers often associated with earthquakes like the explosion of gas lines.
The proposed DM would, at a minimum, review the following proposals: 
§	Municipality of Bucharest: The City of Bucharest currently does not have an emergency monitoring and crisis response center.  The municipal civil protection agencies do not have the capacity to manage large disasters, and do not have the capability to coordinate responses in the case of a major catastrophe. The City of Bucharest needs to develop an integrated emergency response and warning system to better protect the citizens of Bucharest.
§	Macedonian National Response System:  The Government of Macedonia recently established the Office of Civil Protection to handle emergency management procedures.  The state secretary for emergency management has requested USTDA assistance in developing the architecture for an IEMS.
§	IEMS for the City of Warsaw and the Tri-City area of Gdansk, Sopot, and Gdynia: A proposal has been submitted by a U.S. firm to establish an IEMS for these cities in Poland.

The selected DM consultant will need to have experience in municipal and national emergency operations systems, centralized control and command centers and/or call centers, integrative software, and secure systems operations, and be able to design secure IT systems that can incorporate legacy systems if necessary.  The DM consultant will also need to pay particular attention to the potential effects on the environment for any of these proposed projects. The DM consultant will be required to travel to Romania, Macedonia and Poland.  


Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

Business Service Center Contractor

The Joint Contracting Command – Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) has a three-phased requirement to promote and expand a competitive and efficient private sector in Iraq.  The program will assist in the development of self-sustaining, Iraqi-managed business centers in Iraq.  Self-sustainability is a key focus and cannot be over-emphasized; it is paramount and must underlie all of the activities.  During phase one the Contractor will develop a comprehensive Manual of Best Practices for business centers specifically suited for business in Iraq.  During phase two the contractor will use the Manual as a guide to evaluate, identify any shortfalls, implement best practices and develop new services to improve the quality of services available at the established business center in Kirkuk and a new business center in Baghdad.  The new Baghdad business center must build a clientele and establish a fee structure that will cover the costs of its operation during this contract period.  This goal will have an impact on the clients served and the level of training and support services.  The contractor will develop “Best Practices” guidance to assist in achievement of business center self-sustainment. The design and completion of a survey and creation of a database of businesses and business associations requirement will assist in developing a marketing and outreach program for the business centers.  This survey and database will target the cities and surrounding areas where the business centers are located, i.e. Kirkuk and Baghdad.  The survey will assist in identifying the appropriate target market for the two business centers to expand and will provide an important start for the phase three development of the National Business Alliance.  The contractor will develop an umbrella organization to which potentially all business centers and other business associations belong and develop said organization into the National Business Alliance (NBA).  The Contractor shall identify ways that the NBA will become the entity that creates synergies among all Iraqi business centers and more importantly is a voice for private sector entrepreneurs to the national government.  The Contractor will build the NBA into a powerful business-supported organization that focuses its efforts on articulating the needs and issues confronting the private sector in Iraq.  Additionally, the NBA will create links to the Asian, European, and Americas regions to develop strong business ties for the exchange of ideas, goods, and services.  The Contractor must act in keeping with the objective of evolving business centers into self-sustaining Iraqi organizations – independently managed and operated by Iraqis for the benefit of the Iraqi business community.  The Contracting Officer intends to award to the best-qualified contractor capable of providing the services described in the Performance Work Statement.  The selected contractor will represent the best overall value to the Government providing superior capabilities as determined by an integrated assessment of criteria designed to determine which proposal offers the best prospect for effectively accomplishing all requirements.  Interested parties should contact Maureen Ecker by e-mail maureen.ecker@us.army.mil for a copy of the RFP.  2 Aug 05 - Solicitation W91GXQ-05-R-0004 is available for download at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net  Please go to New Solicitations, then PCO Solicitations, then W91GXQ-05-R-0004
