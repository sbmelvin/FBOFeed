<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of International Affairs, intends to award a contract by mean of Other than Full and Open Competition to the National Academy of Science (NAS) for the independent assessment of DOE?s scientific and engineering missions and programs. The anticipated period of performance is June 1, 2015 to May 31, 2020.

The  Contractor will be  performing duties that include: informing DOE of relevant scientific and technical data, and related views of experts, about DOE?s research and programmatic activities; advising on the judgments of the science and engineering fields to public policy;  contribute to the vitality and productivity of DOE?s scientific enterprise  and DOE?s extended research and development communities. NAS?s unique qualification is their ability to provide independent scientific and technical advice of unparalleled objectivity and the highest quality that possesses an inherent degree of public acceptability. Under this contract the NAS may, as requested, examine, experiment, and/or report upon any subject of science or art relevant to DOE?s missions and program and activities. The value of this effort is estimated to be $45,000,000.  
The DOE intends to award an IDIQ Cost (no fee) contract that consists of a five (5) year base period. The DOE is utilizing the exemption to competition under FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), which authorize other than full and open comepetition when there is only one responsible source. In addition, DOE will use its authority under Executive Order 12832, which provides that noncompetitive procedures may be used to contract with NAS. The Executive Order states,
?When a department or agency of the executive branch of the Government determines that the Academy, because of its unique qualifications, is the only source that can provide the measure of expertise, independence, objectivity, and audience acceptance necessary to meet the department?s or agency?s program requirements, acquisition of services by the Academy may be obtained on a noncompetitive basis if otherwise in accordance with applicable law and regulations.?
This is a Notice of Intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. If a firm believes the DOE should not pursue this sole source contract with National Academy of Sciences, then the firm should submit a capability statement and pricing information to Mr. Saul Simmons, saul.simmons@hq.doe.gov, within fifteen (15) calendar days of publication of this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Nez Perce-Clearwater NFs - Newsome Creek Reach 2 Floodplain Restoration
<SOLNBR>AG-02RC-S-15-0060
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>This project is being performed on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests in collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribe Watershed program. The project's main objective is the removal of floodplain dredge piles. This work will improve floodplain connectivity for anadromous fish and other native species in Newsome Creek. Upon completion of this project this portion of Newsome Creek will have improved basic geomorphic valley bottom and stream channel function through the creation of floodplain. The project will be the fifth contract phase to be completed.
<p>The contract requires relocating dredge piles from approximately 5.19 acres of floodplain (approximately 37,000 CY of material). Existing dredge piles and potential soil sources will be excavated and moved to designated repository areas on the project. Vegetation will be transplanted and seed, mulch and slash will be placed on floodplain areas disturbed following construction activities. The contractor will stockpile trees, rock, and other available materials currently on the project area for future restoration work. No in-stream work is required. The 0.3 mile section of Newsome Creek that encompasses the project area, begins at the ending point of similar work completed in 2014.</p>
<p>The project is approximately 38 mi east of Grangeville, Idaho. At the junction of Highway 14 and the Newsome Cr Road (FR 1858), travel north for approximately 7.0 miles to the gate on the right. The access route developed in 2011 takes off sharply uphill. To reach the project area, travel approximately 1.8 miles on an unimproved access route beyond this gate. Access route grades range from 0% - 20%. Maximum grade of 20% is maintained for 0.25 miles descending off ridge to valley bottom.</p>
<p>The Government's construction estimate is between $250,000 and $500,000. No formal pre-bid tour is planned. The site is currently accessible on foot; motorized access is prohibited. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued in early May with implementation planned for the Summer/Fall of 2015 with a contract completion deadline of October 31, 2015. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July.</p>
<p>Original bid bonds will be required. The acquisition has been set-aside for small businesses.</p>

<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION<br /></strong>This is a pre-solicitation non-competitive (notice of intent) synopsis to award a contract without providing for full or open competition (including brand-name). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. <br /><br />The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Consolidated Station Support and Simplified Acquisitions (CSS/SA) Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order to Siemens Medical Solutions USA for Magnetom Trio ATS machine (Siemens 3T Trio MRI Scanner) maintenance support without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name).<br /><strong><br />NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br /></strong>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334516 with a Size Standard of 500 Employees.
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-80 dated March 2, 2015.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY <br /></strong>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives<br /></strong>The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire a service contract to support the NIDA IRP Neuroimaging Research Branch's Magnetom Trio ATS machine (Siemens 3T Trio MRI Scanner). This service is required to ensure continued high imaging performance to support research of neurobiological mechanisms of drug addiction. To ensure standardization of NIDA IRP data and continuance of equipment warranties, only service, and associated parts and labor, from Siemens Medical Solutions USA are acceptable.<br /><br /><strong>Project Description<br /></strong>Specifically, the NIDA IRP Neuroimaging Research Branch requires a service agreement as follows:</p>
<p>1. The contractor must provide a service agreement to maintain a Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine. This agreement must include 97% guaranteed machine up time, same-day delivery of genuine Siemens ISO 9001 certified replacement parts as needed to service the machine, and on-site machine repair during normal business hours with no longer than a 4 hour response window.</p>
<p>2. The contractor must provide telephone access to a support technician regarding the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine within 30 minutes or less. The telephone support technicians must be able to address both technical and applications issues. Telephone support must be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Further, it is expected that telephone support technician shall be able to connect to the NIDA IRP Siemens Imaging Console and provide direct real time support in order to solve most problems with negligible down time, maximizing NIDA IRP data integrity.</p>
<p>3. The contractor must provide quarterly preventative maintenance visits for the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine. These visits shall include tracking and scheduling of required maintenance tasks, exchange of wear and tear parts, care measures, adjustments to factory specifications, verification of specified performance and functionality, documentation and detailed protocols of system condition. Furthermore, the system must be maintained at its current specifications (which may be more stringent than factory specifications).</p>
<p>4. The contractor shall provide regular helium refills and maintenance of magnet ancillary components and magnet performance for the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine. Coverage of parts associated with maintaining the magnet and refrigeration components must be provided by the contractor. Coverage should include burst disc, vent kit, valves, MSUP, ERDU, helium compressor, high pressure gas lines and cold head.</p>
<p>5. The contractor shall provide advanced reports with system-specific usage data regarding the status of the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine.</p>
<p>6. The contractor shall provide software updates and modifications or reliability enhancements to the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine. This includes both Mandatory (safety and performance-related update instructions) and Non-mandatory (reliability-related service instructions) updates.</p>
<p>7. The contractor shall provide access to at least 12 Continuing Education (CE) credits of online training for use of the Siemens Magnetom Trio ATS machine. These credits must be recognized by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).</p>
<p>8. The contractor shall provide for all travel time to and from the NIDA IRP site.</p>
<p>9. The contractor shall provide for any shipping and handling associated with this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery/Period of Performance<br /></strong>The required period of performance is 05/20/2015 - 05/19/2016. A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated.<br /><br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION<br /></strong>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted. Specifically, Siemens Medical Solutions USA is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the MRI equipment requiring service and the equipment is proprietary to the company. As such, only Siemens Medical Solutions USA is authorized to provide service and parts for the equipment requiring maintenance. Use of any other contractor would place equipment integrity in jeopardy which would then risk continuity of science; should the equipment not remain fully functional to original equipment manufacturer standards, standardization of NIDA IRP longitudinal research study data would be jeopardized and any loss of this data would be to the serious detriment of the NIDA mission. Further, use of any other contractor would negate existing equipment warranties. Accordingly, only Siemens Medical Solutions USA is capable of providing the required maintenance support services.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENT<br /></strong>THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must be received by the closing date and time of this announcement and must reference the solicitation number. Responses may be submitted electronically to Lauren Phelps, Contract Specialist, at lauren.phelps@nih.gov. US Mail and Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC><strong>PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE</strong><br /><strong>Project:</strong> Construction Management (CM) Services for Phase 2 of the Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE)<br /><strong>Solicitation No.:</strong> GS-871-7-NCA00208<br /><strong>Agency:</strong> GSA, PBS, Pacific Rim Region (R9), Design &amp; Construction Division<br /><strong>Location:</strong> San Diego, California
<p><strong><br />Contract Type: </strong> Firm-Fixed Price Delivery Order<br /><strong>Budget:</strong> Estimated total Delivery Order cost is between $8,000,000 and $12,000,000.<br /><strong>Estimated Delivery Order Duration: </strong> Fifty-four (54) months</p>
<p>Contracting Officer:  Christopher Lee<br />Contact info:  (415)522-2877, christopher.lee@gsa.gov</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE</strong><br />The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to formally announce the General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Region 9 Design and Construction Division's (9PC) requirement to procure the services of a highly qualified Construction Management (CM) firm in support of Phase 2 of the overall Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project at the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry in San Diego, CA.  As part of this CM procurement the GSA will require a wide range of management, construction, inspection and other professional services necessary to ensure the quality of work and the success of Phase 2.  The CM will be required to maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage/coordinate the timely and orderly development of the design and construction of the project (including coverage for after hours/weekend work as needed).  Given the size, complexity, uniqueness, and overall importance both politically and locally of the project, the CM must have the capability and experience to meet all of the GSA's requirements.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong><br />The San Ysidro Land Port of Entry (LPOE) is the busiest land port in the world.  The 30-year-old outdated facility can no longer support nor enforce the missions of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  The LPOE processes approximately an average of 50,000 northbound vehicles and 25,000 northbound pedestrians per day.  The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) predicts an increase in vehicle traffic at San Ysidro of up to 70% by the year 2030.  SANDAG's studies indicate a substantial economic impact of roughly $8.4 billion in lost revenue to the region resulting from increased wait times at the border. Given the delays at current traffic volumes, capacity of the LPOE must be increased to accommodate regional growth.</p>
<p>To address these growing concerns the LPOE is undergoing a three (3) phase Expansion &amp; Reconfiguration Project estimated to cost over $500M.  Under this procurement the Construction Management (CM) will be required to provide the necessary services to support the successful design and construction of only Phase 2 of the overall project.  It is however anticipated that the Phase 2 construction will be ongoing simultaneously with other projects at the Port, including but not limited to Phase 3, West Pedestrian Building, and Virginia Avenue Transit Center.  Phase 2 contains, but is not limited to, the following primary construction project elements:<br /><br />&bull;	Demolition of the existing Northbound Pedestrian Processing/Detention building, the existing central plant, multiple buildings on East San Ysidro Blvd (specifically those known as the Payless, Milo, and old Greyhound Buildings), and a portion of East San Ysidro Blvd south of the MTS trolley.</p>
<p>&bull;	Construction of a new northbound Pedestrian Processing/Administration/Detention Center Building, a northbound pedestrian pathway and its associated canopy structure from the Mexico border to the new pedestrian processing building, two (2) overhead Employee Pedestrian Bridges, an electrical generator yard, and a Pedestrian Plaza.</p>
<p>&bull;	Renovation of the existing Historic Custom House building to provide a new Pedestrian Processing operation.  Note that the renovation will require consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and adherence to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106 process.</p>
<p><br /><strong>ACQUISITION STRATEGY</strong><br />The GSA will seek a source utilizing the GSA Schedules Program under schedule 871-7 Construction Management &amp; Engineering Consulting Services Related to Real Property and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be prepared by the GSA and will follow the procedures outlined in FAR 8.405-2(c)(3) for proposed orders exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  This procurement opportunity will be open to all qualified firms under this schedule who meet the GSA's requirements identified in the RFP.  This is a competitive source selection using the best-value trade-off process to award a firm fixed price Task Order.</p>
<p>The current schedule anticipates a Task Order award in August 2015, however that is subject to change should the GSA deem necessary.</p>
<p><br /><strong>SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued electronically on or about Monday April 27, 2015 via the FedBizOpps website attached to this posting.  Although it is not mandatory, interested parties are encouraged to affix their names to the Interested Vendors Listing in order to receive notifications.<br /> <br />Issuance of this notice does not warrant that funds are presently available for award of a Task Order.  Award of the Task Order shall be subject to the availability of appropriated funds, and the Government shall incur no obligation under this notice in advance of such time as funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for the purpose of award.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements for 1 (one) High Resolution Raman Microscope System</strong></p>
<p>We require a fully integrated High Resolution Raman microscope for confocal Raman analysis, optimized for the deep UV to IR range (200nm-2500nm). Includes confocal Raman microscope, transfer optics, stigmatic spectrometer equipped with two gratings, multichannel CCD detector, high-performance Windows 7 compatible computer, extensive materials identification database and a computer based instrument interface package compatible with high performance spectroscopy systems.</p>
<p>1. True confocal aperture: Software controlled motorized confocal iris aperture continuously variable from a few um to 1.2 mm. A true confocal iris aperture must be provided between the microscope and the spectrograph for focal depth volume determination which is separate from the spectrograph's entrance slit. This allows independent adjustment of the confocal aperture setting and the spectrograph's resolution.</p>
<p>2. Single spectrograph design for maximum throughput utilizing Czerney-Turner spectrography based on reflective optics to insure the system is free of achromatic aberrations while allowing for a very wide spectral range.</p>
<p>3. UV, VIS and NIR Optics: All Reflective Laser and Raman Optics. Reflective optics are required to allow the change between UV, VIS and NIR lasers for Raman excitation/acquisition without having to swap from UV to VIS/NIR lenses and back going between lasers.</p>
<p>4. SOFTWARE that includes: spectral searching software package equivalent to HORIBA Raman libraries (&gt;1500 spectra for polymers, inorganics, inks/pigments, semiconductors, and biomaterials), spectral searching module, database building module, functional group module and interactive interface.</p>
<p>5. Entrance optics assembly including:<br />- Computer-controlled laser power selection from 9 different positions (100%, 50%, 25%, 10%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%), working from 400 nm to NIR <br />- Interference filter holder <br />- Adjustable kinematic mount for Rayleigh rejection filter (Notch or Edge). This device allows fine tuning of the filter operating angle to optimize low frequency cut-off performances. <br />- Motorized exchange of excitation wavelength (up to 4 filters, for more than 4 filters exchange is manual)</p>
<p>6. Motorized Computer Controller Kinematic Mount for 4+ Laser and PL Filters: All four laser filters must be mounted simultaneously on the laser filter assembly with the last filter position accessible so the filter can be manually and kinematically replaced with a UV laser filter or PL/fluorescence filters.</p>

Switching between video and Raman mode is fully automated.</p>
<p>8. Laser Focal Spot On Sample Visualization: With the sample visualized under white light illumination using a video camera, the focused laser spot must be able to be displayed on the sample for real-time laser positioning and laser focus optimization.</p>
<p>9. Confocal coupling optics between the microscope and the spectrograph including:<br />- Software-controlled continuously-adjustable confocal pinhole from a few microns to 1 mm. Defines with accuracy the size of the analyzed volume. A lateral resolution better than 1 micron and an axial resolution better than 2 microns with a 100X objective in the visible range are obtained. <br />- Dual visible lenses and mirror based coupling optics to the spectrograph.</p>
<p>10.

<DESC><p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>On 04 June 2014, the Government released a Sources Sought Synopsis (GPS III Alternate Sources Production Readiness- FA8807-14-R-0008) requesting Statements of Capability from potential offerors interested in competing for GPS III SV11+ production.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Government conducted an industry day on 09 July 2014, to describe the Government's planned acquisition approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since that time, available funding, schedule, requirements and deliverables have changed as the Government refined its acquisition strategy.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to request Statement of Capability updates or new submissions from interested industry sources to help the Government refine its market research following an acquisition strategy revision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Government plans to host an industry day on 27 April 2015 to further inform industry on program changes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Full details related to industry day are included below.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Discussion</strong></p>
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is intended to gauge industry's capability to demonstrate its technical and production sufficiency for GPS III SV11+.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government plans to use a two-phased acquisition approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase 1 is a Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment to determine if viable, low-risk, high-confidence sources exist to produce the next buy of GPS III satellite vehicles without driving changes to the GPS User and Control segments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase 2 will be a production competition to procure up to 22 GPS III satellite vehicles.</p>
<p>For Phase 1, the Government intends to award up to 3 Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contracts via a full and open competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Each Phase 1 contract's Period of Performance (PoP) is planned for 26 months for the basic contract, and two options for 6-months each, for a total possible PoP of 38 months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed contracts will have an affordability budget maximum of $5M per basic contract and $0.5M for each option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase 1 RFP release is anticipated in 4QFY15 and contract award(s) are planned for 2QFY16.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase 1 technical requirements include the current GPS III SV01-08 baseline with the addition of redesigned Nuclear Detonation Detection System (NDS), Search and Rescue/GPS (SAR/GPS), and Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) payloads, Unified S-Band (USB) compliance, Regional Military Protection capability and no changes to the GPS Next Generation Operational Control System (OCX) or Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) interfaces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Performance and results from the Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment will inform the Phase 2 acquisition.</p>
<p>Phase 2 is planned as a single Fixed Price Type contract awarded through a full and open competition for production of up to 22 GPS III satellite vehicles, starting no earlier than procurement of GPS III SV11.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Phase 2 RFP release is planned for 1 year after Phase 1 Authority to Proceed (2QFY17).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Phase 2 award is planned for FY18 to allow sufficient time to deliver GPS III SV11 in time to support the FY23 constellation need for the 11<sup>th</sup>GPS III satellite vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Please note that Phase 2 details are included in this document only for reference and will be decided after Phase 1 award.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Technical Requirements</strong></p>

<DESC>Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV) - Request for Information <br>  <br> DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br>      a. The objective of the Market Questionnaire is to better understand the availability and capabilities of commercial products and the potential of the associated equipment manufacturers for the Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV).  The information gathered by the U.S. Army through this Market Questionnaire, along with other market investigation data, is solely intended for use by the U.S. Army and will not be shared with any company.  For detailed instructions, please refer to section II of the attached questionnaire.  The U.S. Army will treat information from the questionnaire responses per Section IV as proprietary. <br>  <br>      b. Participation in this Market Questionnaire provides an important opportunity to influence the Army's approach to procuring the ULCV.  The U.S. Army will not provide compensation for any resources spent on this Market Questionnaire and participation is at the discretion of the respondent(s). <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC: Responses must be submitted electronically and must be submitted in one of the three following formats; Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, or Microsoft Power Point. Due to firewall limitations, your response may not exceed a total file size of three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. If your response is longer than that due to the inclusion of graphics, for example, you may use multiple e-mail messages to submit increments of your response to stay under the maximum-size limitation of an individual e-mail. If you are submitting your response through multiple e-mails, the subject line must include a message similar to, quotation mark Response to ULCV Market Questionnaire, message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, etc., quotation mark as well as your organization's name. All interested entities, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this Market Questionnaire.  <br>  <br> Please submit electronic responses and any questions prior to full response to Adam Puzzuoli  via email at adam.a.puzzuoli.civ@mail.mil. Please format the subject line of the response email as follows; quotation mark [Organization Name] response to ULCV Market Questionnaire quotation mark.  <br>  <br>  <br> CAPABILITY SUMMARY FOR ULCV: <br>  <br> The ULCV provides mobility for a 9-soldier infantry squad with associated equipment to move around the close battle area. The ULCV is a lightweight, high mobility platform that will be transportable by all means including vertical lift (via CH47 and UH60) and airdrop. <br>  <br>   Physical Characteristics: Platform characteristics will be heavily influenced by mobility, payload and by the vertical lift characteristics of the UH60 and internal transport dimensions of the CH47 as defined in MIL-HDBK-1791 and MIL-STD-1366.  For purposes of this questionnaire, Vehicle Curb Weight (VCW) will be the base vehicle with fuel, Basic Issue Items (BII) and without payload.  The Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) will be the VCW with a 9 soldier payload (i.e. 3200lbs).  The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) will be the VCW plus maximum designed payload. <br>   <br>   Military Specific Modifications: Blackout Lights, weapon mounts, Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) paint, 24V electrical, MIL-STD-814/MIL-STD-209K provisions, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Slave and Military Petroleum, Oils and Lubricants (POL). <br>  <br>   Mobility: The ULCV shall be a four wheel drive vehicle capable of traversing longitudinal grades up to 60%.  The ULCV shall be capable of meeting the mobility requirements from VCW to GVW on primary surface (10%) with an Root Mean Square (RMS) from 0.1 to 0.2 inches and average speed between 50mph and 55mph, secondary surfaces (20%) with an RMS from 0.3 to 0.6 inches and average speed between 35mph and 40mph, trails (35%) with an RMS from 1.0 to 3.4 inches and average speed of 22mph, cross-country (35%) with an RMS from 1.5 to 4.8 inches with an average speed on 17mph.  Further terrain profile data can be found in section III of the questionnaire. <br>   <br>   Survivability: The ULCV is envisioned as a lightweight, highly mobile open cab vehicle.  Survivability will be achieved through high mobility, a roll cage and occupant restraints. <br>  <br>   Transportability: The ULCV shall be transportable by the following means: C-17/C-130 airdrop including C-17 Dual Row Airdrop System (DRAS), C-17/C-130 internal transport in roll-on/roll-off (RORO) configuration, CH-47 internal transport, CH-47/UH-60 external transport, rail and sea. <br>    <br>   Environmental: The ULCV shall be capable of operating in Hot/Basic/Cold as defined in Army Regulation-38.  The ULCV shall be capable of saltwater/freshwater fording and operating in adverse environmental conditions as defined in MIL-STD-810 (e.g. blowing rain, blowing dust, salt fog, etc.). <br>  <br> GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this Market Questionnaire.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 United States Code  1905 to protect information qualifying as  quote mark confidential quote mark  under this statute. (To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term  quote mark confidential quote mark  in the context of Classified Information, quote mark  we will use the term  quote mark PROPRIETARY. quote mark )  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g. trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the Questionnaire questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br>  <br>      c. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  with an explanatory text so the U.S. Government is clearly notified of the data needing to be appropriately protected. <br>  <br>      d. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or other appropriate means to indicate the portion of a single page to be protected. <br>  <br>      e. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data which is already in the public domain or in possession of the U.S. Government or 3rd parties, or is afterward placed into public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once it is in the public domain.  Data which is already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the government's rights in the data. <br>  <br>      f. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  legend, with any explanatory text on both the cover of the transmittal email and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br>      g. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government will also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br>  <br>      h. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses which contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the respondent's marking of the data as  quote mark PROPRIETARY quote mark  will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.  <br>

These items include desks, chairs, work benches, filing cabinets, tables, book cases, stools, workstations, media carts, and other related furnishings.  The expected order of magnitude for this requirement is $1-5 million.

This requirement is anticipated to require only the furnishing of various furniture items and staging/installation services.

2) Offeror's interest in submitting an offer on the solicitation when it is issued.
3) Company's DUNS number and socioeconomic classification under the applicable NAICS (SDVOSB, VOSB, small business, other than small business, etc.)    
4) Brief capability statement with enough information to determine if the company can meet the requirement.

This sources sought notice does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, but information received in response to this notice may be used to assist our office in developing an acquisition strategy and tailoring the requirement to be consistent with standard industry practices.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information solicited or received. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  All interested contractors should notify this office via email by 12:00 PM Mountain Time on Monday, April 20, 2015.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p>The sole intent of this Sources Sought Notice is to obtain capabilities for procurement planning purposes.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal, or other solicitation, and in no way obligates the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to award a contract.<br /> <br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act or TCA) into law (Public Law 111-31). The Tobacco Control Act amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) and granted FDA authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products to protect public health, generally, and to reduce tobacco use by minors. Currently, FDA regulates cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco (see section 901(b) of the FD&amp;C Act). On April 25, 2014, FDA issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would subject additional tobacco products to such authorities. 79 FR 23,142.</p>
<p>Also, as of June 22, 2010, Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco (21 C.F.R Part 1140) went into effect. This regulation establishes restrictions on the sale, distribution, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use these products, and to reduce the life-threatening consequences associated with tobacco use. For example, it is prohibited for retailers to sell or distribute cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to individuals younger than 18 years of age.</p>

<DESC>This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is for small businesses only. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to determine the interest and feasibility of small business set-asides. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor will the U.S. Government pay for information solicited. The information from this notice will help the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) plan their acquisition strategy or plan.
<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is seeking a contractor to design, conduct and report on the market availability of foods that meet the current and future sodium requirements under the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010. Section 201 of the HHFKA established new school meals standards based on recommendations of the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board. Those standards took effect in July 2012, which include targets for sodium over the next several years. The purpose of this study is to examine from both the industry and school perspectives, challenges and successes in implementing the (HHFKA) sodium reduction policy.</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION<br /><br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is currently conducting market research to solicit comments on the attached Statement of Work and locate qualified, experienced, and interested potential sources. This is NOT a solicitation or pre-solicitation and this notice does not guarantee that a solicitation will be posted in the future or as an obligation on the part of the MCC. At this time, no solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of the solicitation.
<p>INTRODUCTION<br /><br />The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operation, Export Financing, and related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004. MCC is based on the principle that aid is most effective in countries that promote good governance, economic freedom, and investments in people. MCC provides large grants to a small number of eligible developing countries.</p>
<p>MCC's overriding objectives are to promote economic growth and reduction of poverty in our partner countries. MCC does not take for granted that programs will stimulate economic growth and will reduce poverty. MCC looks at likely distributive effects of projects and, to the extent that data are available to perform such analyses, identifies their beneficiaries and estimates their impact on poverty reduction. Ultimately, MCC seeks significant and measurable decreases in the numbers of poor people and significant reductions of poverty. In addition, MCC projects are implemented within a Compact period of five years. Further details on the MCC and its methodology may be viewed at http://www.mcc.gov. In particular, details of MCC's compact development process can be found at http://www.mcc.gov/pages/countrytools/tools/compact-development.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Maritime, Patrol, and Reconnaissance Aircraft (PMA-290)<br />Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD 20670
<p>1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1.1 The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in support of the Maritime, Patrol, and Reconnaissance Aircraft Program Office PMA-290 is seeking information on how a qualified contractor or contractors could fulfill the requirement for P-8A Poseidon Airframe and Engine Depot Maintenance. The Navy is interested in commercial industry strategies to provide P-8A Airframe and Engine Depot Maintenance Services in either an integrated (e.g., single prime and single contract for both airframe and engine maintenance) or non-integrated (e.g., separate contractors and separate contracts for airframe and engine maintenance) approach.</p>
<p>Integrated approach: The Navy is interested in how industry would combine airframe and engine work under a single contract, with consideration to prime and subcontractor relationships, contract management, work load distribution, and any perceived advantages and disadvantages, including efficiencies, synergies, and/or cost savings. <br /><br />Non-integrated approach: The Navy is interested in industry's capability to target the Navy's Airframe and Engine Maintenance as separate efforts, with consideration to cooperation between prime contractors, established commercial practices and/or facilities, and any perceived advantages and disadvantages, including efficiencies and/or cost savings.</p>
<p>Respondents may choose to provide information on one or both of these approaches, including the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, as well as any rationale that would assist in determining which approach would be the most cost-effective strategy to meet the requirements to properly support P-8A Poseidon Aircraft and Engine Depot Maintenance.</p>
<p>The P-8A Depot Maintenance schedule consists of 72 month initial and subsequent 48 month fixed induction dates for the airframe based on calendar days. The CFM56-7B Engine Depot schedule is based on 6,000 engine cycles, driven by variable aircraft utilization. The Navy will be the resource manager and manage the induction schedules for all airframe and engine maintenance requirements. Additionally, the Navy is interested in industry's recommendations for the use of overhauled, rebuilt parts and the use of parts manufacturer approval parts and what benefits, if any, the Navy would achieve. The maintenance requirements include Aircraft on the Ground (AOG), Scheduled and Unscheduled Maintenance that is beyond the squadron capabilities, and Technical Assistance in the removal and replacement of a CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engines both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS). Additionally, NAVAIR seeks information to fulfill heavy maintenance checks, drop in depot maintenance, aircraft modifications and overhaul and repair capability at maintenance repair and overhaul facility.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in the response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP; if any is issued.

In sections where recent experience is requested, all experience will be evaluated for market research purposes only.
 Firms are advised that while experience older than five years or not yet 100% complete may demonstrate capability to perform the scope of work, it may not indicate that the firm could be competitive during a future solicitation where only the most recent five years of experience will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a ?market search? for large and small businesses in preparation for a future procurement. The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide analytical support for the Transportation and Climate Division (TCD) of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) located in the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR).  
   OTAQ has national responsibility for analyzing, monitoring, controlling and reducing emissions from all non-stationary sources of air pollution.  Among other transportation-related activities, the Transportation and Climate Division is responsible for: performing technical analyses of the potential vehicle technology, renewable and alternative fuel pathways and transportation demand options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector; identifying and evaluating various policy options to promote the technology, fuel, and transportation demand pathways; the development of technical and economic modeling tools for transportation analyses; and the maintenance of transportation greenhouse gas emission inventories.  
   Specific areas to be addressed in capability statements submitted by respondents are as follows: (1) economic analysis and modeling;  (2) GHG Life Cycle Analysis of Renewable/Alternative/Petroleum Fuels; (3) vehicle technology assessment; (4) transportation demand assessment; (3) greenhouse gas transportation inventory;  (4) outreach and facilitation support; (5) peer review and; (6) public comments/dockets support.  The successful contractor of any resultant contract will be expected to provide all necessary labor, materials, and services in support of the efforts delineated by the Performance Work Statement (PWS). A draft PWS can be obtained from the FEDCONNECT website, https://www.fedconnect.net/
Any interested firm should submit a capability statement with information that clearly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the services described above, including facilities, personnel, experience and qualifications. Standard company brochures will not be considered a sufficient response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.   It is anticipated that any future contract for these services will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF), Level-of-Effort (LOE) type with five one-year periods, each period with LOE of approximately 31,000 hours including increased quantity options. The applicable NAICS code is 541990 (All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services) with a size standard of $15 million.
In the capabilities statements, contractors should provide their size status for the above referenced NAICS, (i.e. large, small) and whether or not they are a certified hubzone, 8(a), women-owned, small disadvantaged and/or disabled veteran owned concern. As a reminder, small businesses are required to perform at least 50 percent of the costs of the contract performance with their own personnel. 
The EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. Responses to the above shall be submitted to kreacic.michael@epa.gov no later than 15 calendar days from the date of posting. A separate synopsis will be issued for the Request for Proposal (RFP), resulting from this sources sought synopsis.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) Communications Program Office (PMW/A 170), and Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) 6.0 is seeking information from industry on approaches, products and/or solutions for the development and implementation of an Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A- PNT) Navigation Suite.
The Government anticipates an A-PNT Suite will be an ensemble of navigation sensors and systems that may use internal and external references. The Government is specifically interested in solutions that do not require an extra- platform data link to provide valid PNT information. The A-PNT Suite will compute and provide uninterrupted PNT information with a degree of accuracy sufficient to meet mission requirements.
This Request for Information (RFI) and a subsequent Industry Day planned for 2 June 2015 will assist the Government in developing an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) to support future acquisition planning and activities. The Government is in the material solution planning stage only for this technology and has not incorporated the A-PNT requirements into a Government Program of Record (PoR). The Government is conducting this RFI and Industry Day to assist in the analysis of technologies and solutions for use in future acquisition planning activities.
Interested parties are requested to respond in writing to this RFI with a white paper.  Details regarding the format and content of white papers are contained in the RFI document. White papers are due not later than 1200 Pacific Time, Friday, 8 May 2015. Respondents interested in attending the Industry Day on 2 June 2015 must make reservations in writing in accordance with the instruction contained in the RFI not later than 14 May 2015.

<DESC>Statement of Work/Statement of Objective
1. Background. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established an Employee Health Promotion/Disease and Impairment Prevention (EHPDIP) program in Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 as a Veteran Affairs Central Office (VACO) field-based office located in Minneapolis. This program is part of, and funded by, the Occupational Health Strategic Healthcare Group (OHSHG), Public Health (10P3), VACO. EHPDIP is tasked with planning, developing and implementing a comprehensive workplace program for employee health promotion. EHPDIP develops tools and resources for field use, provides guidance to the field, trains VHA employee health promotion coaches, and evaluates all program components for feasibility and efficacy. It has been well documented that comprehensive, strategically designed investment in employees' social, mental, and physical health through employee health promotion programs provide a significant return on investment. Traditionally ROI has been seen as a major predictor of wellness program success. Data required for ROI predictive models has included insurance data such as risk, utilization, and claims.  This data is not available to VHA due to the way Federal Employee Health Benefit constructs its database across all Federal agencies without dividing by individual agency. Due to this inability to access individual agency data from the program it is important to develop a model based on statistically significant and peer reviewed default values. Without the ability to accurately predict default values based on comparable peer reviewed studies it is impossible to access the effectiveness of a VHA wellness program with data that is pulled from a multitude of federal agencies.
The EHPDIP program requires an independent automatic financial and health benefit tool that will determine the benefits of its health promotion program.  This tool shall provide a snapshot of current aggregate employee health status, the most significant modifiable health risks, and the ability to provide estimates of cost savings and cost avoidance across multiple scenarios. This information will be used to analyze the cost drivers and adjust EHPDIP program strategies to address the specific needs of the employee population.
2. Scope. The contractor shall deliver to the Government (VA Medical Center):
a.	Comprehensive, customizable, database  assessment tool that will provide financial and health benefits for the program under multiple user defined scenarios 
b.	Financial benefits to be calculated based on the following inputs:
"	Health risks (i.e. from a health risk assessment)
"	Demographic characteristics (including age, sex, geographic location, and race,). 
"	Cost of risk reduction programs
c.	Outputs will include, at a minimum
"	Cost saving 
"	Cost avoidance 
"	Identification of  modifiable health risk that has the  most impact
d.	Train-the-trainer orientations to educate and support the use of this tool. Approximately 8-10 hours of training for 3 people over 2 sessions. 
e.	Customization to include default values for unavailable information that are peer reviewed and statistically valid
f.	Data analysis and technical support. Report generation will be completed by the VA.
g.	The contractor shall deliver the customizable modeling tool to measure the cost effectiveness of the EHPDIP program through a variety of user specified scenarios
h.	The vendor will provide a tool that is customizable and user defined
3. Objectives.
a.	The EHPDIP program wishes to conduct internal, self-evaluations of VHA health promotion programs across the country in order to validate effective programs, improve programs that are less than optimal and provide an efficient means of selecting programs for continued funding.
b.	VHA will assist with the collection of available data and the review of default data when there is no available data that is required for statistical validity.
c.	VHA will use its findings to improve or create new programs, efforts, initiatives, and offerings to its employees for the purpose of educating and improving their overall well-being. This supports the Presidential Memorandum-Enhancing Work-Life Program including Employee Health Promotion.
d.	Telephone meetings will be held as needed by the contractor or Government.
2.	Delivery.
a.	Contractor shall provide EHPDIP with a financial and health benefit model that is customizable to program requirements at the VHA user level.
b.	All technical, programming and design work will be completed by October 1st 2015. 
c.	Delivery location: Access to the tool will be granted to the Director, EHPDIP and other designees as determined by the VHA.
d.	Receipt documentation: Confirmation of delivery notice will be provided to vendor upon receipt by VHA.
e.	Design, implement and analyze baseline and post test measures for pre-post comparisons.
3.	Government Furnished Property. The vendor will utilize their own computers and software to develop the ROI model.
4.	Security.
a.	If proposing an online application versus a Microsoft Excel (or similar) based program, vendor must adhere to VHA security policy regarding online applications.
b.	Vendor must adhere to the highest standards of confidentiality of data, protection and safety of physical equipment, servers, hosting facilities and all other such systems.
5.	Place of Performance.
a.	Product will be delivered either electronically or via CD/DVD to the VHA EHPDIP program. 
b.	There will be training for EHPDIP on the use of this tool either face to face, online or through conference calls. Approximately 8-10 hours of training for 3 people over 2 sessions.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District has a requirement for the above subject.  THIS IS A NOTICE FOR SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR INVITATION FOR BID.  THERE IS NO BID PACKAGE, SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATION OR DRAWINGS AVAILABLE WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PROCUREMENT COMMITMENT BY THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.  REPONSE IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY; NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  THE GOVERNMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR OR SUFFER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY IMPROPER IDENTIFIED INFORAMTION.  <br>  <br> The purpose of this sources sought announcement is to gain knowledge of interested, capable, and all qualified small businesses including but not limited to Small Business, 8(a) Small Business Development Program, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, and Hubzone firms.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237990; Size Standard $36.5 million.  <br>  <br> To make appropriate acquisitions for the above project, the Government, will use responses to this sources sought announcement and possible future projects as determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  The order of magnitude for this effort is estimated between $5,000,000 to $10,000,000. <br>  <br> Project Information: This action requires the contractor to perform shoreline stabilization of along approximately 1,000 feet at Placement Area (PA) 15 and along 2,800 feet at Mid Bay PA in order to repair eroded areas. Approximately 43,656 tons of riprap and 15,380 tons of blanket stone will be required to repair eroded areas.  Riprap will be approximately 42 quote mark  stone between 210 and 3,565 pounds and blanket stone will be between   quote mark  and 200 pound stone.  Contractors will first remove existing stone from eroded areas along Mid Bay PA and PA 15 and stockpile at specified area between PA's 14 and 15.  A potential Option exists for disposal of rock removed from Mid Bay PA and PA15 at Marsh Cell M10 in lieu of stockpiling at specified area between PA's 14 and 15; however, rock already disposed of at stockpile location will not need to be relocated if option is exercised.  Option for disposal of rock at Marsh Cell M10 will likely require contractor to dig access channels.  Access channel(s) will have to be excavated mechanically (clamshell or bucket - no cutterhead dredge) and will need to be backfilled on completion of the work. Order of work will require erosion repair to be conducted at Mid Bay Placement Area first due to a Migratory bird window. No work allowed at Mid Bay PA between 3/1/16 and 8/31/16 unless cleared by US Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. Other Government Contractors will likely be onsite at Mid Bay PA conducting dewatering operations during the same time frame as the shoreline stabilization contract.  As a result, Contractor for Shoreline Stabilization Job must keep his operations on the exterior of the levee and will not be allowed past inside the crown of the levee. Contractor will perform the majority of the work from the water and will encounter effects of ship wakes. The estimated award date for this project is July 28, 2015. <br>   <br> The contractor will be required to provide Performance and Payment Bonds within (10) calendar days after award.  The contractor shall begin work within (10) calendar days after acknowledgement of the notice to Proceed. <br>  <br> Completion time for Schedule No. 1 is 210 calendar days.   An additional 20 calendar days will be added if the option is exercised.  If the contractor fails to complete the work within the time specified, the contractor shall pay liquidated damages to the Government in the amount of $1,763.00 for each calendar day of delay until the work is completed or accepted. <br>  <br> If you can meet all of the requirements for this project, please respond to this sources sought announcement by e-mail, to the attention of Lucille Smith,  Office# (409) 766-3845, Email:  lucille.r.smith@usace.army.mil .

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)/Wildlife Services, National Rabies Management Program in Concord, NH intends to award a sole source, 2-year contract to Artemis Technologies, LLC (DUNS: 179190116 CAGE Code: 4TKA0) for the supply of the oral rabies vaccine ONRAB&reg; Ultralite baits. Wildlife Services proposes to purchase up to 1,800,000 (500 boxes) units of the Ultralite bait containing the oral rabies vaccine ONRAB&reg; during 2015 and up to 2,000,000 units (556 boxes) during 2016. <br /><br />This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Authority. Citation: 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1).<br />The property or services needed are available from only one responsible qualified source at this time and no other type of property or services will satisfy these needs.<br />&nbsp;<br />USDA, APHIS, Wildlife Services (WS) and state and federal collaborators conducted field trials during 2011-2014 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a human adenovirus type 5-rabies glycoprotein recombinant (AdRG1.3) ONRAB&reg; rabies vaccine in raccoons and striped skunks. To date, Raboral V-RG&reg; (a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant oral rabies vaccine), the only oral rabies vaccine licensed for use in the United States to control rabies in raccoons and coyotes, has been the only oral rabies vaccine used operationally in rabies control campaigns. This vaccine has allowed WS and cooperators to prevent raccoon rabies from spreading appreciably, but achieving elimination of raccoon rabies is expected to require higher levels of rabies antibody seroconversion in raccoon populations targeted for oral vaccination at currently used bait densities. In addition, there is a need to also orally vaccinate skunks as raccoon rabies often spills over into the skunk population, a potential source of re-infection in raccoons. ONRAB&reg; has been identified as a candidate for testing, in part, because this oral vaccine demonstrated higher levels of rabies antibody seroconversion in raccoons than the oral vaccine currently in use in the United States in two cross border comparison studies. In addition, it has produced favorable control in raccoons and, in some cases, skunks in Canada. Although the recombinant ONRAB&reg; vaccine has been used extensively in southern Ontario since 2006 and Quebec since 2007 with good reported success, these field trials represented the first release of this vaccine into the field in the United States. <br /><br />The Act of March 2, 1931 (7 U.S.C. 426-426b and 426c), as amended, provides the Secretary of Agriculture authority to conduct and cooperate in rabies control in wildlife. Rabies is one of the oldest recorded mammalian diseases. All mammals, including humans, are susceptible or rabies. Rabies is almost always transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal, usually a carnivore or insectivorous bat. If humans do not receive timely post-exposure treatment, rabies is fatal. Ready access to treatment, integrated with public health education, and pet vaccination programs, has effectively kept the annual human death rate near zero in the U.S. and other developed countries. Worldwide, however, the human mortality rate from rabies is estimated at 55,000 to 70,000 annually. Post exposure treatment is not available for animals; consequently, animals infected with rabies typically bite or attempt to bite other animals when the disease becomes clinical, often transmitting the fatal virus before they die.<br /><br />Before 1960, the majority of positive rabies cases were reported in dogs. The combination of public education and pet vaccination programs, however, has effectively controlled rabies in companion animals. By the early 1960's wildlife surpassed the dog in reported rabies cases. The principal rabies reservoirs are wild carnivores (raccoon, skunks, foxes, coyote; and the mongoose in Puerto Rico) and bats that have, for the past decade, accounted for 90% or greater of all positive rabies cases reported in animals in the United States and Puerto Rico. Varying ecological, behavioral and biological attributes of diverse carnivore and bat vectors introduce new challenges to contemporary rabies control programs that underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among wildlife professionals, veterinarians, physicians, public affairs specialists, environmental compliance experts, economists, and others. <br />ORV targeting rabies in red foxes began in Europe in 1977, with several countries now classified as rabies free from coordinated campaigns, while others continue to conduct ORV with the goal of rabies elimination. ORV was initiated in Ontario, Canada in 1989, where fox rabies and raccoon rabies have nearly been eliminated through strategic use of this technology.
<p>In 1998, USDA, APHIS, Wildlife Services initiated a national cooperative ORV program, which expanded to include 17 states by 2007 and now includes 15 states in 2015. ORV zones were integrated with natural geographic features such as large lakes, rivers and poorer raccoon habitats at high elevations where practical to bolster vaccination barriers and reduce the overall cost of rabies control. ORV was implemented to eliminate canine rabies (spread predominantly by coyotes) from south Texas. This goal was achieved in 2000, but a 65-km wide maintenance vaccination barrier has been created along the Rio Grande to prevent re-infection from Mexico. The containment barrier for gray fox rabies that was created in 1996 in west-central Texas has been collapsed with the goal of elimination over the next 4-5 years. Much of the remaining effort is to contain raccoon rabies that occurs from southwest Alabama to Maine from spreading to new areas, while exploring elimination strategies. <br /><br />This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about its products and services to the Contract Specialist listed on this notice by 4:00pm. Mountain Time (MT) on the closing date of this notice. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 325414 - Biological Product (except Diagnostic) Manufacturing, and the Small business size standard is 500 Employees.<br /><br />Responses received after the response date or without the required information will be deemed nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. Capability statements may be sent to: Carol Dingess, Contracting Officer , USDA-APHIS-MRPBS, AAMD Procurement Branch, 2150 Centre Avenue Building B MS (2E20) Fort Collins , CO 80526, or via email @ Carol.Dingess@aphis.usda.gov or fax @ 970-472-1897.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) on behalf of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM-FSS), located at the Natick Soldier Systems Center intends to award a sole source Containerized Kitchens (CK) contract to the incumbent contractor OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC of 28712 Glebe Rd Easton, MD, 21601-7431. This proposed procurement is for Containerized Kitchens for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. As the current provider of the Containerized Kitchens NSN 7360-01-473-3408 OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC is the only contractor that can meet the current requirements.   <br>  <br> The following verbiage is taken directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102 and FAR 6.305(b).  <br>  <br> 1. Description of Services and Supplies: <br>  <br> PM-FSS requires up to twenty one (21) Containerized Kitchens NSN 7360-01-473-3408 to return the fleet to the Army Acquisition Objective quantity, the supplies/data to support them, and to bring the CK into compliance with Army energy efficiency initiatives. <br>  <br> 2. Reason for Authority Cited: <br>  <br> To date 1,054 Containerized Kitchens have been fabricated by OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC. This completed the Army Acquisition Objective (AAO); however, washouts and battle losses have necessitated this additional contract action to bring fielded numbers back up to the AAO. OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC is uniquely qualified to produce CKs logistically compatible to the fielded units as they alone possess the complete technical data package. The Government has not obtained a license nor does it currently possess the technical data necessary to produce the fielded CK. <br>  <br> The quantity of systems to be procured is only about 2% of the total fleet. It is in the best interests of the Government to replace the losses with systems manufactured to the same technical specifications as the rest of the fielded fleet. Only OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC possesses those specifications. <br>  <br> The ownership and understanding of the technical data also make OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC uniquely qualified to modify the CK configuration to accept the AMMPS generator and to manufacture the CK under the proposed contract with that power source. This also provides OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC with the capability to complete the modification design to refit the existing CKs with the new AMMPS generator. Replacement of the TQG with the AMMPS is necessary to achieve fuel savings in accordance with Army policy. TQGs are being phased out of inventory and will not be supported in the future. OVC- Engineered Solutions, LLC formerly known as Sotera Engineered Solutions, LLC is the only source with all the necessary data and privileges on hand to correctly design, test and document the modifications necessary when replacing the TQGs with the AMMPS generator. <br>  <br> While not being awarded under the FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency authority, there exists a mission urgency that must be recognized.  Fleet losses have brought the AAO down below the number required to ensure that units will be mission ready and capable when called on again.  It is the intent to restore units to full capability as quickly as possible. This can only be done by a sole source award to the one manufacturer currently capable of producing the system. Manufacture of these systems would not require a full-blown first article test since production was completed less than 12 months ago. There is high confidence that the same manufacturer using the same production line will build and deliver identical systems logistically compatible to those previously provided. <br>  <br> 3. Additional Information: <br>  <br> This is a notice of intent and is not a request for competitive quotations or proposals. No solicitation is available. Parties that believe they can meet the bridge contract requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and provide a substantive statement with descriptive literature and any other supporting information within 15 days of publication of this notice. All information received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government to determine if the more than one responsible source can meet the Government's requirements and is capable of performing the intended CK contract. <br>  <br> Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Natick Contracting Division (NCD) via e-mail to: Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on April 25th, 2015. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground CCAP-SCN, ATTN: Natick Contracting Division, Building 1, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5011 <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s): <br> Sean Auld, Contract Specialist, Sean.G.Auld.civ@mail.mil, (508) 233-6183. <br> Curtis Britton, Contracting Officer, Curtis.L.Britton.civ@mail.mil, (508)-233-6150

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed NASA Langley offers you a deployable and stowable mechanical design for filling the cavity behind the leading-edge slat (i.e., slat cove), when it is extended upon landing an aircraft. Aerodynamic flow over an unfilled cavity typically exhibits strongly unsteady behavior that is a source of aeroacoustic noise. Conventional leading-edge slat devices for high lift are a good example of such geometric and flow conditions and are a prominent source of airframe noise. Experimental and computational results have shown that a slat-cove filler device could significantly reduce the noise produced by slat structures. The proposed structural concept is simple and will enable autonomous achievement of the desired deployed shape. The design will facilitate a clean cruise configuration with minimal weight addition to the aircraft. NASA is seeking development partners and potential licensees. NASA Langley designed the superelastic shape memory alloy slat-cove filler to provide significant broad-band noise reduction to any aircraft wing structure that has a leading- edge, high-lift device and is distinct from the main-wing element. The design can be retrofitted to existing aircraft structures and can be easily incorporated into the existing or future designs for aircraft wing structures. The concept involves very few components, requires no additional mechanical support from pneumatic or hydraulic systems, and makes use of existing slat-actuation systems for retraction. The design is autonomous, simple, and constitutes low-weight addition. The concept is also considered fail-safe because the lift would not be diminished in the event that the slat-cove filler failed to deploy.  NASA Langley also offers a design for a deformable structure that is deployed from the leading edge of the main-wing element. It closes and covers the gap between the slat and the main-wing element. This approach has similar benefits as the slat-cove filler device. U.S. patent 8,763,958. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a technology at the forefront of a new generation of computer and video game environments that train valuable mental skills beyond eye-hand coordination, for the personal improvement, not just the diversion, of the user.  The technology is derived from previous research focused on automatic adaptation of flight deck controls based on user feedback. Monitoring and enhancement of operator state is the objective of the current LaRC Intelligent Integrated Flight Deck Technology (IIFDT) program. New research has enabled modulation of the manual inputs that a player makes to joysticks, controllers, and image recognition video input devices. The new input device allows a player to control inputs to a video game by adjusting his/her physiological state, such as heart rate and breathing, in addition to standard controller or video inputs. This allows for an entirely new approach to integrating psychophysiological signals into game play. The technology is constructed to allow modulation of a persons input to a video game or computer simulation. Input modulation is based on the players psychophysiological state. The invention exploits current wireless motion-sensing and body gesture technologies to utilize physiological signals for input modulation. These include, but are not limited to, heart rate, muscle tension, and brain wave activity. In addition, the experience of electronic game play can be enhanced by introducing a multiplayer component in which various players collaboratively pursue the goals of the game. The device can also augment multiplayer experiences such as video game tournaments, in which the skill set required in competitive game play is increased by allowing players to interact with the game, and compete with one another, on a psychophysiological level. The current capability has been successfully prototyped using the Nintendo WiiTM console and wireless Wii remote as well as the XboxTM console and KinectTM motion-sensing device. Prototypes have been designed and are being developed to extend the current capability to the PlayStationTM MoveTM and other similar game platforms. U.S. patents 8,858,325 and 8,827,717.

<DESC>Notice: Intent to Sole Source
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Homeland Security Research Center (NHSRC), located in Cincinnati, OH intends to award, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), to ManSci, Inc. for a PeCod On-line Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) Analyzer. The PeCod P100 Analyzer System is the only known real time, reagentless, Stand-Alone Automated COD Analyzer. These characterizes are essential to allow for fast, accurate COD readings that are frequent and can be accomplished in an unmanned fashion.
The instrument will be used to test the feasibility of using on-line COD analysis to trigger contaminant warning systems within drinking water distribution systems.  The EPA's current grab sample and reagent methods are too slow and labor intensive to provide data in real time to trigger meaningful contaminant response.  Therefore an automated "on-line" COD monitoring system is needed. 
The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334516.  The size standard for this code is 500 employees. Telephone requests will not be honored. Anticipated award date will be in June 2015.  Documentation must be submitted to Lisa C. Ryle by 3:00 PM, April 25, 2015. 
This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETATIVE QUOTATIONS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No solicitation document is available.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to Lisa C. Ryle, Contract Specialist, at the office identified above, by e-mail ryle.lisa@epa.gov.   The technical documentation must establish that the instrument to be provided meets all requirements.
Contracting Office Address: US Environmental Protection Agency/CPOD 26 West Martin Luther King Drive, Mail Code: NWD Cincinnati, OH 45268

<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to optimize the methods of application used in preclinical studies and Clinical Trials Phase I, as to conform to the needs for use in the battlefield, and to advance in the regulatory process toward a Biologic License Application by conducting Phase IIA and Phase IIB Clinical Trials of the CLOT FOAM agent. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br>  <br> US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity, ATTN: MCMR-AAA, 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD 21702-5014 <br>  <br> Point of Contact(s): <br>  <br> Scott Comeau  301-619-8826 <br> Scott.A.Comeau2.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> A.	The Contractor shall produce a disposable, biocompatible, low weight thermally isolated application device for use in the field by paramedics.  Such a device shall be based on the principles, expertise and requirements established in the development of the investigational device used in Phase I, including: <br>  <br> 1. Use and misuse of the device failure analysis.  The objective of this risk management activity shall be to conduct a study with particular focus on the identification of potential misuse, failures or misapplications that could potentially lead to gas embolism(s) or other harms associated with the device. The analysis shall be used to characterize the safety of the existing controls, identify existing controls, and replacement components to ensure consistent performance at recommended pressure and distance settings.  Two separate Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEAs) (Use/Misuse and Design); will be conducted in order to identify potential failures and controls for proper device function and use. It should be noted that these FMEAs shall also consider the Food and Drug Administration (FDA's) concerns regarding FDA's Medical device safety alert for embolisms. <br>  <br> 2. Surface pressure and flow rate characterization.  The purpose of the study shall be to conduct an engineering characterization on the prototype of the improved applicator device. A Class B, bench top study shall be conducted to characterize gas flow rate through the applicator tip and surface pressure on the delivery site will be studied over a range of pressure settings and distances, including alternate components, to support the safety of the device design. This includes analysis of flow rate, and surface pressure, including a fixed resistance precision orifice acting as an adjustable flow regulator, lure connectors, flexible tubing, check valve, and sterile filters. <br>  <br> 3. Biocompatibility testing.  As required for Biologics License Application (BLA) approval, a biocompatibility study of each device component must be conducted according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-1. <br>  <br> 4. Leachable and extractable assays.  Analyze chemical compounds that migrate from any product-contact material when exposed to a solvent, typically using a variety of solvents at high temperatures.  The goal of an extractable study shall be to identify as many compounds as possible that have the potential to become leachable. The process shall include identifying which components will have direct contact with biomaterial, determining if the supplier provided compendia testing, what sterilization processes will be used, and finally extracting the materials in multiple solvents.  The leachables study shall be carried out in conjunction with shelf life studies at each pull point. The number of samples shall be based on the acceptable quality limit (AQL) in accordance with ISO 2859-1 or ISO 1886.   <br>   <br> B.	Conduct a Phase IIA Clinical Trial as an adjunct to hemostasis in a liver surgery protocol. <br>    <br> 1. The Phase IIA Trial shall demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the technology.  Safety shall be determined by the incidence, severity and relationship of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, estimated rates of immunogenicity/viral exposure and post-surgery bleeding complications.  Efficacy shall be determined by the percentage of subjects who achieve hemostatic success within the 1-minute time to hemostasis (TTH) assessment period, percentage of subjects who achieve hemostatic success within the 5-minute TTH assessment period, and the percentage of subjects who maintain hemostasis with no re-bleeding events within the 10-minute TTH period. <br>   <br> C.	Conduct a phase IIB Clinical Trial as primary treatment in a spleen laceration protocol in hemodynamically stable and noncoagulopathic patients. <br>    <br> 1. The Phase IIB trial shall demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the technology.  Safety shall be determined by the incidence, severity and relationship of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory abnormalities, estimated rates of immunogenicity/viral exposure and post-surgery bleeding complications.  Efficacy shall be determined by the percentage of subjects who achieve hemostatic success within the 1-minute TTH assessment period, percentage of subjects who achieve hemostatic success within the 5-minute TTH assessment period, and the percentage of subjects who maintain hemostasis with no re-bleeding events within the 10-minute TTH period. <br>  <br> D.	The Contractor shall provide a detailed Product Development Plan and detailed tasks in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), Integrated Master Plan, Integrated Master Schedule and other related program documentation.  These documents shall be of sufficient detail to describe the magnitude and type of work required to support U. S. Army Research and Materiel Command's mission objectives contained herein.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisitions Activity  (USAMRAA), on behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Material Agency (USAMMA), is issuing a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source contract. This is not a request for proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to pay for cost incurred in preparation and submission of data in response to this announcement. <br>  <br> This is a Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source contract to Oceanit Laboratories, Inc., 828 Fort Street Mall #600, Honolulu, HI, 96813-4314, utilizing Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program (JWMRP) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2),  only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br> As directed by Congress in the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, 2014 Report 113-85, page 190, $100M  quote mark shall be used to augment and accelerate high priority Department of Defense (DOD) and Service medical requirements and to continue prior year initiatives that are close to achieving their objectives and yielding a benefit to military medicine.  The funds shall not be used for new projects or for basic research. quote mark   For this reason, the undersigned determined that the cited statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is supported and required. <br>  <br> This Bill essentially limits the competition to contractor's that have existing Congressional Special Interest Research Projects (contracts or assistance agreements) and have a military relevance. The Bill also states that funds shall be awarded at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense following a review of medical research and development gaps. The strategy in executing the JWMRP was to find highly valued research efforts on a research grant or contract that could meet critical service requirements and that were not being continued through other appropriations.  Based on a comparative analysis by the scientific and programmatic reviewers from USAMRMC, approximately 45 JWMRP research projects were selected for a follow-on effort to the previous effort. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command of the Department of Defense (DOD) have worked with Oceanit Laboratories, Inc. as a subcontractor to the Henry M. Jackson Foundation on the subcontract award of MDA-00-1-0021 starting on April 17, 2001. <br>  <br> Oceanit Laboratories, Inc. proposes to revise the LifeBed and Passive Physiological Monitor which provides continuous vital signs of the patient through a passive, unobtrusive sensor array into a Chair called a LifeChair.  This chair will use non-contact methods to continuously and accurately monitor heart and respiration rate in medical evacuation scenarios.  The contract will leverage existing FDA-approved, market-ready LifeBed technology; a bed coverlet that continuously and accurately monitors heart and respiration rates without requiring patient contact, in a hospital setting. In particular, the LifeBed hardware will be converted for a chair format and altered as needed to meet the wireless communications, EMI, and ruggedization standards associated with medical evacuation platforms. The software and underlying data processing/algorithms will be refined to be robust to noise introduced in a rotary wing or ground transportation scenario. Preliminary verification testing will evaluate usability and data accuracy, followed by more rigorous clinical trials in relevant operational environments. <br>  <br>

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE
<p>Description: Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) - Industry Day.<br /><br />Purpose: Program Manager, Air Command and Control and Sensor Netting (AC2SN), Program Executive Officer Land Systems, Quantico, VA, will host an Industry Day conference on May 6, 2015 at 9:00 AM ET to provide an overview of the CAC2S program and anticipated full rate production RFP. The CAC2S Industry Day will provide industry with a description of CAC2S, operational requirements, physical design, acquisition strategy, and business strategy. Industry will be provided an opportunity to review and comment on the completeness and fidelity of the Technical Data Package (TDP), ask questions about the program, and gain insight into the intended full rate production solicitation. The intent of the Industry Day is to provide advance information about the program to Industry and obtain feedback to assist PM AC2SN with structuring future solicitations.</p>
<p>Requirement: PM AC2SN is interested in pursuing a programmatic approach that will lead to the acquisition of systems to meet the Marine Corps need for a modernized, expeditionary, modular, scalable, and adaptable aviation command and control capability. The CAC2S acquisition strategy is based on an evolutionary acquisition approach that will facilitate rapid development and fielding of capabilities in increments and phases. Increment I collectively groups requirements into the following functional areas: Communications Subsystem (CS), Processing and Display Subsystem (PDS), and Air Command &amp; Control Subsystem (AC2S). The Increment I, Phase 1 CS and PDS baseline requirements have been met through modification of existing Marine Corps Systems Command fielded equipment, specifically upgrades to the AN/MRQ-12(v)3 Communications Interface System (CIS), which is currently fielded with the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS), and upgrades to the AN/TSQ-239 Combat Operations Center (COC), a system that is widely fielded throughout the Marine Corps. The Increment I, Phase 2 AC2S has been developed and is in low rate initial production for IOT&amp;E and subsequent fielding. The anticipated full rate production contract will be a build-to-print, firm fixed price contract for forty-one (41) AC2S units.</p>
<p>Meeting Location: Vencore, 800 Corporate Drive, Suite 101, Stafford, VA 22554. Front desk telephone number is (703)878-5400.</p>
<p>Conference Information: Attendance to this Industry Day is recommended for all vendors interested in CAC2S full rate production. Due to space limitations, interested parties are requested to limit their attendance to no more than two (2) representatives per company.</p>
<p>The Industry Day will be UNCLASSIFIED with information that may become ITAR restricted, and, therefore, attendance is limited to individuals who are only U.S. citizens and representatives of U.S. companies.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT:</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, is applicable to this requirement with the following clause addenda to paragraph (a),<br />EVALUATION AND AWARD: The Government will award to the responsive, responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to this solicitation and is the best value to the Government. A "best value" award will be made to the offeror submitting an offer found to be most advantageous to the government. The Government will determine technical acceptability during technical review. The following evaluation factors in the descending order of importance will be used to evaluate offers: <br />(1) Technical Acceptability <br />(2) Price<br />(3) Delivery</p>
<p>1. Technical acceptability is defined as the contractor's ability to meet or exceed the requirement. Technical acceptability will be evaluated on a Pass or No-Pass basis. <br />Only those offers evaluated, as Pass will be further evaluated and considered for award.<br />PASS: The offeror has submitted the required documentation necessary for the purchasing activity to determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics of the requirement.</p>
<p>FAIL: The offeror did not submit the required documentation necessary for the purchasing activity to determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics of the requirement.</p>
<p>2. Price. Offerors will be evaluated for price. Price shall be quoted in accordance with the CLIN(s) to be incorporated in the Schedule of Supplies and Services in the event an award is made. Price shall include a firm fixed price.</p>
<p>3. Delivery. Offers will be evaluated for delivery. The requested delivery date is 30 days after receipt of award. Delivery is defined as the capacity of the offeror and affirmation by the offeror to deliver all items per shipment as specified within the requested delivery date. As shipped, all deliveries shall be delivered to Fort Bragg, NC 28310 in one shipment (preferred). <br />The factor of technical acceptability is significantly more important than price and delivery combined. The factor of price is slightly more important than delivery. Offers shall remain valid for a minimum of 30 days.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and Defense Federal Acquisition Supplement (DFARS) 252.212.7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items are applicable to this requirement and offerors shall include a completed copy of the Representations and Certifications with their bid.</p>
<p>DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation. <br />Unique Identification Information<br />UID of items is accomplished by marking each qualifying item with a permanent 2-dimensional data matrix. The data matrix is encoded with the data elements necessary to construct a Unique Item Identifier (UII) which is globally unique and unambiguous. The data elements required to form a UII include the manufacturer's identification (i.e. cage code) and the item's serial number. If the manufacturer serializes within part number, that data element will also be encoded.<br />Because the data matrix is machine-readable, IUID marking greatly reduces human error and improves the accuracy of inventory and acquisition records.<br />UIIs are stored in comprehensive IUID Registry, which allows easy access to information such as acquisition cost and life-cycle data. The IUID Registry is maintained by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS).<br />Every IUID delivery includes the required data elements describing the end item and the "pedigree" of embedded items. This data is captured during the acceptance process via the Wide Area Workflow (WAWF) application, or after acceptance via direct data submission. Items marked with IUIDs accelerate the receipt and acceptance process, allowing DoD to submit payment to its vendors in a timely fashion, thereby saving on late charges)<br />SOFARS 5652.219-9004, Technical and Contractual Questions Concerning this solicitation using the same contact information identified in clause 5652-201-9002.</p>
<p>DELIVERY/ ACCEPTANCE POINT: Delivery location is Fort Bragg, NC 28310. Full delivery address will be provided upon award. It is requested that all items are delivered per shipment once maintenance is completed.</p>
<p>To be considered for award, the contractor shall have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) formerly the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Registration can be completed at www.sam.gov.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200116 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-80 effective 2 March 2015.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413.  The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:

FLOOR AFT
P/N: 366A21-0108-09

RDD: 6/20/2015



All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210).  Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  

Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This procurement is being solicited to GSA vendors on an unrestricted, firm fixed price basis in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13. 
Evaluation will be made based on lowest price technically acceptable to the Government. Technical acceptability will be determined by ability to provide the specific brand name and model number components requested, as well as ability to meet the requested delivery lead time.
Item Descriptions and specifications.  All quotes must adhere to the specification below in order to be found technically acceptable.  Please note: This is a BRAND NAME ONLY Request prepared IAW FAR 6.302-1(C). Only products manufactured by Plantronics shall be considered.  
It has been determined that there are limited manufacturers that provide headsets compatible with the existing AVAYA Model 2420 Digital Telephones. Market research has indicated there are only (2) known manufacturers that product compatible headsets; Plantronics and Jabra/GN Netcom . However, the Canandaigua VA already has several hundred Plantronics interface cables already in their possession and attached to the phones. A headset by Jabra would not be compatible with the cables by Plantronics.  Likewise, the requested ear pieces are specific to Plantronics headsets. Allowing brands other than Plantronics to be considered would facilitate a need for hundreds of additional pieces of equipment to totally replace the stock of accessories currently at the site.

The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price contract under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. This procurement will be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable, for the procurement of the following brand name or equal:  <br>    <br>  Orbitrap Fusion  ETD Mass Spectrometer System  <br>    <br> Specifications: <br> ITEM 0001 <br> Orbitrap Fusion  ETD Mass Spectrometer System <br>  <br> Specifications: <br>  <br> BRAND NAME OR EQUAL TO the ORBITRAP FUSION ETD MASS SPECTROMETER SYSTEM  <br> SYSTEM ORBITRAP FUSION ETD <br>  <br> ORGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURE (OEM): <br>  <br> Thermo Scientific   <br>  <br> Orbitrap Fusion  ETD (FSN01-10002, SYSTEM, ORBITRAP, FUSION, ETD) mass spectrometer combines quadrupole, linear ion trap, and Orbitrapmass analyzers and features multiple fragmentation techniques-CID, HCD, ETD and EThCD - all available at any stage of MSn, with subsequent mass analysis in either the ion trap or Orbitrap mass analyzer. Every Orbitrap spectrum can be calibrated in real time with the EASY-IC  Ion Source. <br>  <br> The instrument contains the following: <br>  <br> EASY-Max NG ion source API inlet source housing with x- and y-direction probe positioning and a fixed on-axis view port. All gas and voltage connections are hard connected automatically, enabling worry-free performance and ultimate reliability. The EASY-Max NG ion source includes one HESI spray insert. <br> EASY-Max NG ion source with APCI includes both HESI and APCI spray inserts.  <br> EASY-IC  Ion Source generates internal calibrant ions for real time mass calibration of any Orbitrap spectrum. <br>  <br> Vacuum system containing a split-flow turbo molecular pump, which controls the vacuum in multiple regions. <br>  <br> Progressively spaced stacked-ring ion guide (S-Lens), which captures and efficiently focuses ions in a tight beam. The Active Beam Guide reduces noise by preventing neutrals and high-velocity clusters from entering the quadrupole mass filter. <br>  <br> Quadrupole Mass Filter consisting of 4mm field radius quadrupole mass analyzer with a hyperbolic surface and a 10% RF imbalance, which provide excellent peak shape and transmission with a minimum resolution of 0.4 FWHM. <br>  <br> Orbitrap Mass Analyzer with an m/z range of 50-6000, resolving power of up to 500,000 <br> FWHM and isotopic fidelity of up to 240,000 FWHM at m/z 200. <br> A Dual-Pressure Linear Ion Trap used for MSn precursor ion isolation and collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron-transfer dissociation (ETD). The ions are detected at a maximum scan rate of 20 Hz using a dual-dynode detector with high linear dynamic range for improved quantitation and a large surface area for increased lifespan and robustness. <br>  <br> EASY-ETD  Ion Source, generating fluoranthene anions for electron transfer dissociation (ETD) and the EASY-IC  Ion Source generating internal calibrant ions for real-time mass calibration of any Orbitrap spectrum. The system also features an independent dual barrel syringe pump and injector/divert valve with mounting bracket, which are both controlled via the data station for maximum flexibility. <br>  <br> Computer System: OptiPlex 9010 Minitower <br> Processor: 3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3770 Processor <br> Memory: 8 GB, 3.4GHz w/ HD4000 Graphics <br> Monitor: Dell S2740L (27 quote mark ) LED Monitor <br> Video: Intel  Integrated Graphics w/o Adapters <br> Hard Drive: 1TB SATA 6 GB/x with 32MB Data Burst Cache, 1TB <br> DVD: 16X DVD +/- RW SATA, 16X DVD ROM SATA <br> Keyboard: Dell USB Keyboard, English. <br> Mouse: Dell USB Optical Mouse <br>  <br> ITEM 0002: <br>  <br> System Training 3 days or minimum required training days <br> UltiMate 3000 Single Channel Variable Wavelength Detector (Without Flow Cell) OR EQUAL <br> UZ-View Flow Cell Micro for VWD-3000 Series, 180 nL Volume, 10 mm Path length OR EQUAL  SW,COMPNDISC1.0&MF7.0SR3 (27 quote mark  MONITOR) OR EQUAL <br>  <br>  <br> This clause applies in its entirety and there are currently no addenda to the provision. <br> Proposals shall be submitted in two (2) separate volumes: <br> Volume I:  Orbitrap Fusion  ETD System W91ZLK-15-R-0018 PRICE PROPOSAL <br> Volume II: Orbitrap Fusion  ETD System W91ZLK-15-R-0018 TECHNICAL PROPOSAL <br>  <br> ALL PROPOSALS SHALL BE SUBMITTED VIA EMAIL WITH THE SUBJECT LINE:  <br> W91ZLK-15-R-0018 PROPOSAL FROM (INSERT COMPANY NAME)  <br>    <br>  Proposal Format:  <br>  Volume I: Detailed Price Proposal to include the following elements:  <br> 1.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   <br>      <br>   (b)   Submission of offers. The proposal shall consist of two separate parts (Technical and Price) as listed below.    <br>   	   <br>   (c) Award will be made to one (1) offeror on the basis of the lowest priced proposal meeting the technical acceptability standard in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. The Government intends to award without discussions with respective offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial proposal should contain the best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government, however, reserves the rights to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.     <br>      <br>   (d)  The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:    <br>      <br>   1. Technical Acceptability: The Government shall evaluate the offeror's technical proposal on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis.     <br>      <br>   2. Price: Award will be made to the offeror that proposes the lowest price and is determined to be technically acceptable.   The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers.     <br>      <br>   3. Past Performance:  Past Performance will be evaluated based on information obtained using internal systems.  Offerors are not required to submit Past Performance information.  The Government will use information obtained using other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems.  The offeror will either be deemed acceptable or non-acceptable in this area.  Any offeror which has no relevant Past Performance will be deemed acceptable.   <br>      <br>   4.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.   <br>      <br>   (d) Procedures:    <br>      <br>   All offerors will be required to prepare and submit their complete proposal submission in accordance with the proposal preparation instructions in Provision 52.212-1 of this request for proposal.  Proposals and other information will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria stated in this provision.     <br>      <br>   (e) Evaluation Factors   <br>      <br>   1. Technical - Factor 1 (Limit to 10 pages)   <br>      <br>   a.	 Have a minimum of 2 years  experience in Project Management   <br>   b.	Project Management Certification   <br>   2.  Price - Factor 2 (No page limit)   <br>      <br>    a. Factor Assessment:  This criterion evaluates the overall price to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  The Government may determine an offer unacceptable if the proposed prices are materially unbalanced which is defined as significantly understated or overstated in relation to the actual cost of that work or when the price is determined not to be fair and reasonable.    <br>       <br>   b. Ratings:  Price proposals will be evaluated, but not rated.    <br>      <br>   c. Description of factor:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all option periods to the total price for the basic requirement.     <br>      <br>   3.  Past Performance - Factor 3   <br>      <br>   a. The Government will use information obtained using  sources such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems.     <br>      <br>   b. The offeror will either be deemed acceptable or non-acceptable in this area.  Any offeror which has no relevant Past Performance will be deemed acceptable.   <br>      <br>   (End of provision)   <br>      <br>   Attachment 1 titled  quote mark Bid Schedule quote mark .   <br>   Attachment 2 titled  quote mark PWS quote mark .   <br>

<DESC>The work for this project consists of new construction of a 5,000 square foot Pre-Engineered Building (PEB) Storage Facility (Warehouse). The proposed new warehouse will be used for the storage of general non-hazardous and non-flammable goods, and will not be inhabited by a full-time employee. The primary access into the building shall be via two overhead bay doors. One is located along the front (southerly side), and one is located on the east side. Additionally, there will be two man doors located on the east side, and the rear (north) side. The warehouse will be divided into two primary areas by a chain link fence to be installed in the interior. There will also be a smaller caged area, with chain link fence on three sides and a ceiling. Interior rooms are the Fire Pump room, and an electrical room. The warehouse is to be located in the northwesterly portion of the property located off Kansas Street. Access to the new warehouse will be provided by existing paved roads and driveways that currently provide access to the subject area. Natick SSC is responsible for researching, developing, fielding, and managing food, clothing, shelters, airdrop systems, and soldier support items.<br />

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-80 effective 2 March 2015. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts: WINDOW P/N: 366A25-1350-20 NSN: 1560-01-HS2-2111 QTY: 20 EA MFGCD: 3GSZ1 RDD: 5/1/2015 ROLLER P/N: 366A25-1350-26 NSN: 5340-01-HS2-2782 QTY: 100 EA MFGCD: 3GSZ1 RDD: 5/1/2015 All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopters Incorporated (Cage Code 3GSZ1). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location. It is the Government's belief that AHI, the OEM is the only known source to provide the genuine parts required. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts. NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

1.	If the pricing falls under $150,000 is it acceptable to use Tripartite Escrow Agreement to meet payment protection purposes?  Typically no bid bond is required unless it's over $150,000.

Answer: Yes it is acceptable if proposed price is less than $150,000. 

Therefore FAR clause 52.228-13 ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROTECTIONS (JUL 2000) is incorporated to this solicitation.
(a) The Contractor shall submit one of the following payment protections:
a payment bond;
an irrevocable letter of credit;  or
a certificate of deposit.
(b) The amount of the payment protection shall be 100 percent of the contract price.
(c) The submission of the payment protection is required within 15 days of contract award.
(d) The payment protection shall provide protection for the full contract performance period plus a one-year period.
(e) Except for escrow agreements and payment bonds, which provide their own protection procedures, the Contracting Officer is authorized to access funds under the payment protection when it has been alleged in writing by a supplier of labor or material that a nonpayment has occurred, and to withhold such funds pending resolution by administrative or judicial proceedings or mutual agreement of the parties.
(f) When a tripartite escrow agreement is used, the Contractor shall utilize only suppliers of labor and material that signed the escrow agreement.
(End of Clause)

RE: Questions and Answers

1.	Is it the intention to have the existing radiators removed or disabled and left in place?  If they are removed, the empty space will need to be finished to match the existing wallpaper and trims which could get very expensive.

Answer:  Any Existing Radiators in the Administrative Office areas, that are deemed no longer necessary, can be disconnected from the system, capped and "abandoned in place". Any Existing Radiators in the Maintenance areas, that are deemed no longer necessary, shall be disconnected from the system, and removed from the site".

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory Aerospace Systems Directorate intends to execute a technology development and demonstration initiative to reduce the scope of the technical effort required to establish both the initial, and the continuing airworthiness of airframe structure manufactured from advanced composite materials. The program will identify and select, develop, and demonstrate technology which will improve our ability to assess and predict, and control the structural integrity of composite structure as a function of its constituent materials, configuration, features, and manufactured state, and as influenced by its known history and expected future service environment and loads.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.               <br>                               <br>               The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.               <br>                              <br>               The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.                 <br>                                    <br>               This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.                <br>                                 <br>                The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.                <br>                                <br>                The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.

If so, could you please provide their company name and contract number?  <br>    <br>  Answer:  There are several, different incumbent contractors currently, or had previously, performed different aspects of what will be on this new contract.  To avoid having to work with different contractors for O&M, Grounds Maintenance and Snow/Ice Removal at 3 different sites, the requirement was combined into this one new consolidated contract.   <br>    <br>  --- END OF CHANGE 7 ---  <br>    <br>  CHANGE 6 - The following information are incorporated herein:   <br>      <br>   1) The Government is intending to conduct a Pre-Solicitation Conference (as opposed to the previously planned Pre-Proposal Conference) and Site Visit to Germersheim, Gruenstadt and Coleman Barracks.  This Pre-Solicitation event is scheduled for Monday, 20 April 2015, from 0800 to 1500 HRS.     <br>      <br>   2) Interested firms are requested to submit names to mary.j.harding8.civ@mail.mil of no more than 3 representatives per company.

I didn't see them in yesterday's post.    <br>        <br>    Answer:  Internally, the Government still has a few actions that have to take place before we can move forward with the issuance of the RFP and other milestone events.  So, more than likely, the Pre-Proposal Conference/Site Visit milestone will move to the right.      <br>        <br>    2) The weblink to the Annual OPSEC Awareness Training    <br>    required of contractor employees is:  http://cdsetrain.dtic.mil/opsec/.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole-source basis from incumbent CACI Technologies, Inc. (CACI) at 14370 Newbrook Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151 for 747,091.2 hours of support services. This is necessary for the continuance of contractor support services to the Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division (Code 4.11.4) of NAWCAD to support a subset of Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence (C4I) projects including quick reaction mission functions in the field of Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Electronic Systems (ES) and interoperability with the Department of Defense Architectural Framework (DoDAF). The services support rapid design, development, prototyping, modification, integration, test and evaluation, installation, fielding, certification, procurement, fabrication, and maintenance/logistics support of C4ISR ES. The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing ongoing support currently being done under existing CACI task order, N00178-04-D-4026-M801, while the follow-on contract is being competed with an estimated award date of 3 March 2017. This requirement will be a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) bridge contract. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under task order N00178-04-D-4026-M801 and the need to continue these services without a break in work, CACI is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may submit informational inquiries related to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 14 April 2015, 1530 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. For information contact Kathleen Notaro, Code 2.5.1.3.6, Telephone (301) 737-7560, or via email: kathleen.notaro@navy.mil.
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." CACI Technologies, Inc. is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services without impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in services. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole-source basis. For subcontracting opportunities with CACI Technologies, Inc., please contact Patrick Devine at (301) 737-3198, or by email at pdevine@caci.com, or Sherry White at (703) 679-4173, or by email at shwhite@caci.com .</p>

This will be a two-phase procurement utilizing the tradeoff method.

A sources sought notice was posted on 18 March 2015 under solicitation N40085-15-R-0046 to determine availability and capability of small businesses to perform the requirement.  Based on market research results, the procurement will be solicited as an unrestricted procurement with full and open competition.  NAVFAC Mid-Atlantics Office of Small Business Programs concurs with the determination to solicit as an unrestricted procurement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price (FFP) type contract on a sole source basis to United Electronic Industries Services LLC (EUI), 8264 Sub Base, Suite 3, St. Thomas, VI, 00802 for&nbsp;slightly modified commercial item&nbsp;PowerPC Processors with VXWorks BSP parts P/N DNA-PPC6-IG-MIL that will be used in the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Command, Control, Computers, Communication and Navigation (C4N) System Baseline Configuration 4 (SBC4) Control, Alarm, and Monitoring Systems (CAMS). The parts are to be procures ad follows: 16 each P/N DNA-PPC6-IG-MIL. The contract will contain options for up to an additional 86 P/N DNA-PPC6-IG-MIL.
<p>This action is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: After testing and trade studies, it was determined the UEI is the only vendor that can provide a unit that meets all the required salient and environmental characteristics of the LCAC C4N SBC4 specifications. As such, UEI is the only source capable of meeting this requirement. Currently, there are no other possible sources that can satisfy tis requirement without substantial duplication of cost as well as significant schedule and technical risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Procuring other slightly modified commercial items would require extensive engineering testing and certification which would significantly increase cost and result in required deliverable dates not being achieved. Delivery is required 8 weeks after contract award. Delivery will be made to the Receiving Officer, Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD), 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City FL 32407.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested offeror(s) wishing to qualify items for future procurements may submit request(s) for qualification, via e-mail, to Contract Specialist, Stuart Burman, at stuart.burman@navy.mil. Requests must be marked with this synopsis designation number and should include the offeror's name, address, telephone number, commercial and government entity (CAGE) code, point of contact, and clearly identify the offeror's capabilities. Request for qualification shall be provided on or before 1600 (CST), 13 April 2015. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">This project is located within Case Mountain Area of Critical Environmental Concern in Tulare County, California adjacent to Mineral King Road approximately 6.5 miles southeast of Three Rivers. This project consists of the replacement of the existing </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">50 foot long,</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt"> one lane Kaweah Bridge over the East Fork Kaweah River and the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>deck and railing replacement of the adjacent<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>20 foot long 6 Mile Flume Bridge.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> The bridges are located on Case Mountain Road within Bureau of Land Management Lands, and </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">provide critical access for fire management activities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The existing Kaweah Bridge is an approximately </span>50 foot long structure composed of steel railroad flatcar repurposed into a 3 span bridge.<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> The bridge site is located on Case Mountain Road approximately 1000 feet from the intersection of Mineral King Road. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The proposed replacement bridge is a 55-foot by 12-foot </span>prefabricated steel bridge<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> with glue laminated (glulam) deck panels, timber running planks, and steel </span>thrie-beam<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"> rail. The contractor will be required to provide a fully engineered, simple span, single-lane, portable modular steel girder bridge. Steel fabrication will need to be completed by an AISC certified fabricator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The bridge will be founded on concrete spread footings to be placed behind the existing concrete piers and between the existing stone masonry wingwalls. Great care will need to be exercised during construction to avoid damage to the stone masonry wingwalls and to minimize required removal of the existing concrete piers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">The existing 6 Mile Flume Bridge is an approximately 20-foot long by 13.5-foot wide structure composed of steel wide flange girders supporting a timber deck. The proposed work will consist of removal and replacement of the existing timber decking, running planks, curbing and steel rail with </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">glulam timber deck panels, glulam timber running planks, and timber rail. </span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">Both bridges will be closed to all traffic during construction. With the completion of the new bridges, both bridges which are currently load posted to 10 tons,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>will be brought up to current live load standards. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">The Kaweah Bridge will require a 55-foot long pre-fabricated steel bridge and approximately 800 LB of reinforcing steel, 9 CUYD of structural concrete, and 45 CUYD of structural excavation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The 6 Mile Flume Bridge will require approximately 0.4 MFBM of glulam structural timber, 25 SQYD of glulam structural timber decking, and 32 LNFT of timber bridge railing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 8.0pt">This project is located within a sensitive location on BLM lands with site access provided by the narrow and winding Mineral King Road and the bridge provides critical access for fire management activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All construction debris will need to be contained and kept out of the East Fork Kaweah River and 6 Mile Flume. Great attention to detail will be required in achieving customer satisfaction in areas of bridge construction, timely completion of work, and minimization of impacts to natural resources.</span></p>

<DESC>IGF::OT::IGF ULSG Tree Survey - This project is intended to conduct a comprehensive survey of all existing trees located on the grounds at Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site (ULSG).  Of particular interest are any remaining trees which may date back to the mid-19th century time frame, as they would have been present at the time Ulysses S. Grant lived at this location.  This project will identify trees present on ULSG grounds prior to 1900.  The site is a total of 10 acres of mixed vegetation, with areas of finished lawn as well as unmaintained areas of heavy vegetation.  There is a creek running through the western side of the site.  Trees to be surveyed under this contract are all trees greater than 4 diameter at breast height (dbh).  Upon completion of this project, the Government will be provided an Arborist report, which will include a tree assessment for every tree within the parks boundary, a digital map of the site with every tree plotted, and .  This information is necessary to guide future actions and decisions pertaining to the preservation and maintenance of this site.

<p>LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION<br />Number: JA15-050</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Procuring Activity Competition Advocate, hereby approve this limited source justification in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B). The acquisition referenced herein is conducted under the authority of the MAS Program.</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION<br />1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE: Requesting Agency: DISA, Development and Business Center<br />Services Development Directorate<br />P.O. Box 549<br />Ft. Meade, MD 20755-0549</p>
<p>Contracting Activity: DISA/DITCO-PL8311<br />2300 East Drive<br />Scott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S): The nature of this action is to procure one 3- month firm-fixed-price option period plus three 1-month firm-fixed-price option periods to extend the period of performance (POP) for contract HC1028-09-F-2709. The POP for the current contract ends March 29, 2015. This extension will extend the POP by 6 months if all options are exercised. The POP of the extension will be March 30, 2015 - September 30, 2015. This extension will ensure continued support under the IRIS contract during the follow-on recompete evaluation. The IRIS Sustainment extension effort actively supports the sustainment, maintenance, and multi-browser interoperability of the IRIS application that is currently being used in the DISA Development and Business Center. Fiscal year 2015 operation and maintenance funds will be used for this acquisition.</p>
<p><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES: Continuity of services is required for support to DISA. IRIS is a web-based tool that provides support for the following mission areas:<br />budgeting and reporting, planning and resource control, acquisition management, financial management, and contracts management.</p>
<p>The requirements definition for the re-compete follow-on package was delayed until senior management could make decisions regarding the long-term usage of IRIS in DISA. It was decided that the IRIS application would be used for budgeting and reporting, planning and resource control, acquisition management, financial management, and contracts management until the Enterprise Financial System is stood up, projected to be some time after October 2016. The duration of the upper management discussions that led to this decision, in addition to an already tight recompete schedule, caused a delay in the recompete package approvals and a resultant need for a bridge contract until the recompete contract is awarded.</p>
<p>The IRIS requirement is currently in the recompete process with a projected award date of June 30, 2015. The recompete package will provide continuous sustainment and maintenance, optional value-added capabilities, optional user base expansion (initial and sustainment support), and retirement transition support for the IRIS application until the transition to the Enterprise Financial System. The IRIS application is planned to be sunsetted when the Enterprise Financial System is ready to perform IRIS-equivalent functions, projected to be some time after October 2016.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of support for this extension is $1,229,742, which includes up to 12,000 hours labor utilizing the labor categories included on the current contract, HC1028-09-F-2709 for a 3- month base period and three 1-month option periods:</p>
<p>Base Period: March 30, 2015 - June 29, 2015 $614,871<br />Option Month 1: June 30, 2015 - July 29, 2015 $204,957<br />Option Month 2: July 30, 2015 - August 29, 2015 $204,957<br />Option Month 3: August 30, 2015 - September 29, 2015 $204,957</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF LIMITED SOURCE AUTHORITY AND DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
<p>(a) Circumstances Justifying Limiting the Source. Pursuant to FAR 8.405-6 (a)(1)(i)(B), only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.</p>
<p>(b) Description of the Justification. The incumbent contractor is the only source capable of providing the services required in an efficient and effective manner. Delta Resources has been supporting the IRIS application since 2005 and has intimate, proven knowledge of the application's architecture, programming code and capabilities. For example, due to the recent DISA-wide reorganization; program element codes, organization codes, task mappings, and new approval chains will have to be developed and implemented. A different contractor would require at least one month to become familiar enough with the application to even start this process. The new contractor would not have the depth of knowledge to efficiently perform the tasks required in the short period of time (3 to 6 months) between the</p>
<p><br />end of the current contract and the award of the re-compete effort. If a break in service would occur, the application would be unsupported. This application supports budget execution, funds and program management, and contract management functions. If the application failed for any reason, these important tasks would have to revert to paper processing, potentially causing staff disruption, inefficiency, errors, and contract management issues. Any lapse in application bug fixes, role/user maintenance, or application recoding requirements would cause a major disruption to the mission.</p>
<p>(c) Justification.</p>
<p>(1) Minimum Government Requirements. In order for existing IRIS user communities to continue their budget management, acquisition tracking, package processing and contract management processes in the most efficient and effective way possible, the current contractor is needed to sustain and maintain the application until the contract recompete action is completed. The application is an essential business system for approximately 200 users who process funding packages, manage budgets and acquisitions, and manage contracts using this tool. Additionally, there is a current requirement to expand the user base temporarily until a new enterprise-level tool can be developed. The Government needs this temporary expansion to be started within the next few months. This could only reasonably be accomplished by the incumbent.</p>
<p>(2) Proposed sole source contractor. Delta Resources, Inc., has been supporting the development of IRIS since 2005 through two competitive awards. The current task order, HC1028- 09-F-2709, has a POP from September 30, 2009, through March 29, 2015, in accordance with FAR 52.217-8. Delta Resources has unique knowledge of the existing code base that goes back 9 years and is currently completing the code base update to the new Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 5 architecture. The contractor will start multi-browser interoperability when testing this HTML5 upgrade in March 2015. A new contractor would not have the depth of knowledge to efficiently perform the tasks required in the short period of time (3 to 6 months) between the current contract and the re-compete effort. If a break in service would occur, the application would be unsupported.</p>
<p>(3) Discussion regarding cause of the limited source situation. The sole source situation was caused by changing Government requirements at the highest levels of DISA. Over the past 10 years, there have been several business units that had an immediate requirement for efficient ways to process and manage budgets, acquisitions, and contracts; IRIS was one of those systems. During this time there have also been high- level discussions regarding the Enterprise Financial System deployment. This fiscal year, a far-reaching business process reengineering effort team is gathering the requirements served by these internally developed systems. The original IRIS re- compete PWS had a requirement for DISA-wide expansion. After much discussion, those expansion plans were changed. DISA management decided in December 2014 that IRIS would be retired when an agency-wide tool is available. The length of these discussions, added to an already tight recompete schedule, caused the need for a sole source bridge to ensure that the IRIS application is fully functional and available during the source selection process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4) Demonstration of limited source. Delta Resources has unique knowledge of the existing code base that goes back 9 years and is currently completing the code base update to the new Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) 5 architecture. The contractor will start multi-browser interoperability when testing this HTML5 upgrade in March 2015. It would cost the Government approximately $1M in initial duplicative implementation support as well as 6-9 months for the new contractor to acquire the knowledge and skills to effectively and efficiently support an application that is new to them on all levels.</p>
<p>(5) Procurement Discussion. The follow-on contract recompete effort is well underway. The initial quotes were received February 3, 2015, with an expected award date of June 30, 2015. This sole source award will ensure that the IRIS user community can continue to complete their mission activities in the interim.</p>
<p>(6) Impact. The IRIS user community relies on the application to complete their mission on a day-to-day basis; many users have the application open and are actively using it most of the day. The main user base historically processed an average of 1,300 procurement packages per year. These activities would take, at the very least, twice the amount of time as they do now with a paper-based system. Without the procurement package processing capabilities, there is continued inefficiency and greater potential for error. In addition, there is increasing upper management emphasis on efficient procurement actions; these priority implementation actions would be delayed.</p>
<p>5. BEST VALUE DETERMINATION: A review of all pricing options has been examined, and it has been determined that the contract extension represents the best value IAW FAR 8.404(d). By extending the current task order using the procedures in Part 8, the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR 2.101) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs. Services offered on the schedule are priced at hourly rates. GSA has already determined the prices of supplies, fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates to be fair and reasonable. Additionally, the contracting officer will evaluate the labor mix, labor categories, and labor hours proposed by Delta Resources in comparison to the level of effort and complexity of the requirement outlined in the PWS and will compare rates for similar services to determine whether the prices are fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Based on the current contract costs and published labor categories and rates for similar services, the contracting officer has adequate information to ensure that the costs to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The contracting officer will determine whether the order represents the best value to the Government by conducting both a technical review and fair and reasonable price determination. A price reduction will be sought in accordance with FAR 8.405-4.</p>
<p>6. MARKET RESEARCH: Because the IRIS sustainment contract is being recompeted as mentioned above, a Sources Sought was published on November 25, 2013 which sought</p>
<p><br />responses from small business contractors. Responses were received from 22 contractors.<br />Six of the 22 companies were initially found to be technically capable of performing the anticipated re-compete work. Targeted market research was sent via email on March 21, 2014 to six vendors who had specifically indicated an interest in future IRIS contract competitions. As a result of that targeted market research, it was confirmed that two or more small businesses were found with the experience to support Department of Defense Government acquisition processing systems, and therefore, a small business set-aside is planned. This market research described above validates the limited availability of contractors who may be able to create a Technical Data Package (TDP) and training materials after 6 to 9 months of working with the IRIS application. Because Delta Resources is the only contractor who has ever supported the IRIS application since it was created in 2005, they are the only contractor who can perform this work in an efficient and effective manner, without an expensive lag time of 6 to 9 months.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS: None.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION:</p>
<p>(a) Procurement history. Delta Resources, Inc. has been supporting the development of IRIS since 2005 through two competitive awards. The current order, HC1028-09-F-2709, has a POP from September 30, 2009 through March 29, 2014 and has a value of $11M.</p>
<p>(b) The recompete for IRIS is a GSA small business set-aside acquisition on the General Services Administration Information Technology Schedule IT-70 (GSA IT-70). The request for quotes was released on December 22, 2014, and quotes were received February 3, 2015. This recompete effort is in the initial proposal evaluation stage. The projected date of award is June 30, 2015.</p>

ORDER >$3,000
FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  
Contractor: Quest Diagnostics, Inc.	
Contractor Address: Three Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940-1027	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	NCO 1 Consolidated Contracting Activity
		940 Belmont Street________________
	Brockton, MA 02301	
                                                                       VISN:	1	
(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
The contractor has a valid Federal Supply Schedule Contract V797P-7105A and has been providing satisfactory services. The current Task Order ends on March 31, 2015 and there is not enough time to prepare a new solicitation without interrupting direct patient care services. 

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The contractor will be responsible for the pick-up and transportation of specimens to the contractor's	
Laboratory. The contractor shall be responsible for transporting in such a manner as to ensure the integrity of the specimen. The contractor shall supply special preservatives as required for specimen preservation and packing material capable of maintaining temperature requirements for specimens until they reach the Contractor's laboratory under the terms of this agreement. The Contractor shall provide return transportation of specimens/slides to the ordering site when required such as slides designated as technical components only. Services inclusive of: Diagnostic Immunohistochemistry markers - technical component only; Immunohistochemistry morphometric analysis, tumor immunohistochemistry quantitative or semi quantitative - technical component only;
Immunohistochemistry markers- technical component only specific for colorectal cancer;
Cytogenetic Karyotype and FISH testing services. This would also include consultative services and associated services to complete the consultation. If analysis cannot be performed due to culture failure then only a culture fee will be charged rather than a fee for a completed analysis; ERCC1 - Lung carcinoma marker testing services; Her2 by FISH testing services; In situ Hybridization testing services; Molecular Diagnostics for KRAS mutation analysis and microsatellite Instability by PCR; Support West Roxbury pathology lab during times when high volume and/or staffing shortages. West Roxbury pathology lab serves as the consolidated lab in VISN 1 for special stains, immunohistochemistry markers and flow cytometry.

	(b)ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $180,000 for 6 months (6 month award with FAR Clause 52.217-8 requested) to ensure time to solicit and award a long term FSS BPA.

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:   April 1, 2015	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Quest Diagnostics currently holds a Federal Supply Schedule  V797P-7105a with the required testing and services needed for VISN 1 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC's). Quest is capable of servicing all VAMC's within the turnaround time required for testing results. Quest provides standard pick-up services in their standard cost-per-test fee and the laboratories are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

1	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
The current task order ends on March 31, 2015. Due to the short time frame of this direct patient care need, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue services with the incumbent for a six month period, with the option to extend services clause to ensure there is coverage for our Veterans testing needs.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Quest Patient Service Centers are located within short distance of many of the CBOC's in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.  This is very convenient for our veterans not to travel great distances for this service and ensures better patient compliance. If this service was interrupted it would be detrimental to our Veterans.
(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A request for information was posted on FedBizOpps on February 24, 2015 for ten days. Further market research will be conducted for the long-term contract action to ensure competition is sought and a solicitation is competed amongst all available Federal Supply Schedule holders.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
This is a direct patient care service and without these services in place, it would be extremely detrimental to our Veterans healthcare services. 

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The agency has already surveyed the marketplace and will develop a long term strategy for competition to ensure if other vendors offer similar services or start providing services in New England, services will be competed amongst all viable vendors.

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
The contractor has a valid Federal Supply Schedule Contract V797P-7105A and has been providing satisfactory services.  Quest Diagnostics currently has the only FSS contract for all testing required by NCO 1 covering 27 sites (Medical Centers and Outpatient Clinics). The current Task Order ends on March 31, 2015 and there is not enough time to prepare a new solicitation without interrupting direct patient care services. 

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The services will include: a) Interface with VA's VistA System. Best practice is to eliminate manual entry of results and employ an electronic result entry process.  The interface with Quest has reduced risk of manual entry errors in VISN 1; b)Transportation of clinical laboratory specimens, originating from the VA Medical Center and Satellite Outpatient Clinic laboratories destined contracted commercial reference laboratory ; c) IntraVISN transportation of clinical laboratory specimens originating from the VA medical center and satellite outpatient clinic laboratories destined to VA West Roxbury or VA West Haven; d) Performance of analytical testing; e)Reporting of analytical test results; e)Consultative services; f)Patient Service Centers within the New England area for phlebotomy services.
	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $600,000 for 2 months to work on long-term FSS BPA.

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   4/1/2015

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. 

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Phlebotomy Draw Stations or patient service centers are in convenient locations throughout North East that collect specimens and then transport them to the host facilities for testing.  This benefits the Government's CBOC's that do not have on-site phlebotomy service and also allows for test results to be entered in the patient record.  Courier Service/specimen transport between VA labs within the VA New England Healthcare VISN 1 for the purpose of Intra-VISN testing at the Government's core laboratories located at West Haven and West Roxbury.

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
Patient results are automatically transferred from Quest to VA Vista System.  This eliminates manual entry of patient results and vendor reference ranges.  Manual entry errors are a high risk area in the laboratory.   Best practice is to eliminate manual entry of results and employ an electronic result entry process.  The interface with Quest has reduced risk of manual entry errors in VISN 1.
1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
Set up cannot be transferred from one site to another.  Set up for this connectivity is not interchangeable between medical reference lab vendors.  In addition to the connectivity issue, any change in reference lab would require test file changes in the VISTA system.  This would also be a time consuming task to undertake.  It is not in the best interests of VISN 1 to expend additional manpower to change medical reference lab vendors at this time. Quest Diagnostics has provided quality testing as the primary medical reference laboratory vendor for all sites in VISN 1.  As part of the VISN, the program manager of the laboratory for the VISN 1 campus has taken the initiative to standardize laboratory testing services to the greatest extent possible.  This process has defined several different types of cost per reportable test requirements and service requirements that can be standardized and still meet the approvals and regulatory requirements of the Veterans Administration, College of American Pathologists (CAP) and Joint Commission (JC).  The individual services have been identified with several different vendors with specific technical capabilities and/or coordination requirements specified by VISN 1 laboratory protocols.  This coordination process has provided the laboratory service with the best client service and shortest turnaround time for providing patient results.
1	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
The current task order ends on March 31, 2015. Due to the short time frame of this direct patient care need, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue services with the incumbent for a two month period, with the option to extend services clause to ensure there is sufficient time to conduct market research with this procurement. 

 (5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The prices offered represent the best value to the Department of Veterans Affairs consistent with FAR 8,404(d), because an additional discount to the FSS price list is given by Quest Diagnostics based on estimated volume for testing services.  It would not be cost effective to change the primary medical reference lab testing vendor, giving the amount of manpower required to change test files and set up a new interface.  The purpose of the interface is for the electronic transfer of test results from the Quest Diagnostics information system to the VA information system.  This process reduces/eliminates manual entry error.  This is a great patient safety concern.  In addition Quest Patient Service Centers are located within short distance of many of the CBOC's in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.  This is very convenient for our veterans not to travel great distances for this service and ensures better patient compliance. If this service was interrupted it would be detrimental to our Veterans.
(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted among the Federal Supply Schedule holders capable of providing medical reference lab testing services for the consolidated laboratory by the program manager.  The other reference laboratories in the FSS category do not offer advantages in testing, services or economy that Quest Diagnostic provides.  Therefore, Quest Diagnostics represents the best value to the government considering the services required by the VISN 1 Laboratory.
 (7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The agency has already surveyed the marketplace and will develop a long term strategy for competition to ensure if other vendors offer similar aspects services or start providing services in New England, it will be competed amongst all viable vendors.

VzB is the current SSP of PKI certificates for VA under delivery order VA118-14-F-0306; contract GS-35F-0382T.  Under this order, VzB issues PKI encryption certificates to VA employees and contractors, as well as provides certificate revocation and recovery support.  In addition, VzB is the current host and operator of VA's PKI certificate authority.  VzB holds PKI encryption certificate key pairs in escrow storage on VA's behalf in accordance with X.509 Certificate Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework.  Hence, when a PKI encryption key is created VzB issues the key pair to the user, and stores a copy of the private key in a separate data store under its control.  This escrow storage is unique and specific to VzB where other vendors do not have access to the data and it cannot be transitioned to another provider due to the requirements to maintain PKI certificate trust relationships with the existing VzB certificate issuing authority. 

VA does not possess the ability to retain encryption keys due to the fact that only VzB retains the proprietary rights to the PKI certificates they issue.  Only VzB's hosting certificate authority software can provide the required decryption capability and compatibility with encrypted certificates and keys issued to VA employees and contractors.  Therefore, only VzB can provide the required PKI certificate recovery and revocation services since only VzB has access to the proprietary data and enterprise databases supporting automated PKI certificate issuance and administration functions for VA.  In December 2014, VA contacted VzB to ascertain if its proprietary data was for sale.  VzB advised that this data is not for sale.  All PKI certificates previously issued by VzB to VA employees and contractors can only be revoked and recovered using VzB's current certificate authority.  VzB is the sole provider capable of operating the current proprietary certificate authority that maintains and controls all VA PKI issued by VzB.  No other source other than VzB can host the complete PKI currently used to issue, recover or revoke certificates.  VzB is the only source capable of operating the current PKI and publishing the verification information for credentials to recover or revoke certificate key pairs from the current system.  

The current VzB delivery order ends on April 9, 2015 and a break in service would immediately invalidate VA secure email PKI certificates provisioned on personal identification verification (PIV) cards issued to employees and contractors eliminating ability to access critical VA systems and severely disrupting delivery of healthcare and benefits to Veterans.  VA is currently in the process of transitioning from PKI services provided by VzB to services provided by the Department of Treasury (Treasury).  The transition of PKI services is a complex task requiring coordination between VA, VzB, and Treasury; nonetheless, VA previously anticipated these tasks would be completed before the current order expires.  However, the migration of the PKI services to Treasury continues to be delayed by unforeseen technical issues.  Specifically, during a migration of VA's PIV card management system, it was discovered that the Treasury's Entrust software product did not function as expected with regards to maintaining user key history.  User key history permits PIV card holders to access their old encrypted email.  Treasury's Entrust configuration tool is currently unable to retrieve VA key history from VzB.  As a result, it was determined that VA needs to modify the Entrust software to allow it to transfer key pairs, which will not be completed before the end of the current VzB delivery order.  After the Entrust software is modified, additional testing is needed to verify that the software is able to retrieve the VA key history.  The modification of the Entrust software is expected to begin in October 2015.  Accordingly, this proposed action provides the nine month base period and 12 month option to continue the current services provided by VzB and provides time to complete the modifications to the Entrust software, perform testing, and reassess VA's ability to complete the PKI SSP Services transfer to Treasury.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition.  In accordance with FAR Subsection 8.405-6(a)(2) and FAR Section 5.301 a copy of this Limited-Sources Justification will be posted along with a synopsis of the award to the Federal Business Opportunities website within 14 days of award.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  VA does not anticipate any future need for continuation of VzB PKI issuance support once the transition to Treasury is complete and expect future procurements will be done on a competitive basis.  VA has completed the transitioning of the existing contractor-hosted and maintained Card Management System (CMS) from VzB's data centers to a VA-hosted and maintained system located in VA data centers.  Additionally, VA currently has multiple PKI contracts that are administered by the application owners which they support.  On August 30, 2013, VA established an Interagency Agreement (IA) with Treasury for enterprise-wide PKI certification as current PKI contracts do not meet VA's overarching needs. VA's technical transition to being fully supported by Treasury is currently incomplete, thus driving the need for continuation of VzB PKI certificate issuance, recovery and revocation services.  Once the technical transition is complete there should not be a need for future follow-on PKI certificate issuance contracts.  

8.  Market Research:  Market Research was conducted in December 2014 and January 2015 by OI&T SDE ESE representatives that queried GSA FSS 70 product catalogs and National Aeronautics and Space Administration Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement IV Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts for companies to fulfill VA's PKI needs.  While multiple companies are certified to issue new PKI certificates under existing guidelines, none have the capability to operate the current infrastructure supporting VA.  VzB is the only source capable of operating the current infrastructure, publishing the certificate verification information for credentials, and conducting maintenance of all previously issued certificates, since VzB retains the proprietary rights to PKI certificates issued.  No other vendor has the capability of recovering PKI encryption certificates and keys issued by VzB.  Therefore, a new delivery order with VzB is required to maintain ability to issue, revocate, and recover PKI encryption certificates and keys.     

9.  Other Facts:  VA requires the ability to issue, revocate, and recover PKI
encryption keys in order to maintain access to key material that allows for the decryption of email. This process is required by the policies under which the certificates were issued, and supports users' access to legacy data. There are also numerous legal and law enforcement initiatives that require VA to maintain access to the escrowed key material for seven to ten years. A break in service would render VA unable to issue and recover previously issued encrypted certificates and would not meet the PKI requirements.
