This contract will be for a minimum of 12 months, with the option of continuing up to an additional 4 years, renewable on a yearly basis. For quality assurance purposes, the Government retains program oversight, but will not exercise direct supervision over the Contractor's employees performing services under this contract, except in the instance and interest of safety or national emergency. The Contractor shall provide the requirements set forth in this contract in a manner that allows the Government to safely conduct ARCAP. The Government shall provide all flight instructors and services, other than those provided by the contractor, necessary to perform flight training as defined in this document. The Contractor shall provide the capability to fly up to approximately 600 hours in a 12-month period, as specified in the workload estimates.

<DESC>Prequalification of Sources<br />For<br />Horizontal Construction Contracts<br />For Southwestern Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements
<p>This is a PREQUALIFICATION OF SOURCES announcement, issued in accordance with DFARS 236.272. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents will be notified of the results of the Prequalification of Sources Selection.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Fort Worth District is seeking to create a Prequalified Sources List for horizontal construction projects in support of the Border Infrastructure Program along the US-Mexico border. The Prequalified Sources List will be available for use while other acquisitions are underway for similar requirements. It is anticipated that use of the Prequalified Sources List will occur for up to 18 months after the list is established, and possibly longer. The Prequalified Sources List will be used as a vehicle to solicit several stand-alone "C" type construction contracts with a total value of up to approximately $8B. Only firms on the Prequalified Sources List will be eligible to compete for these solicitations.</p>
<p>The Border Infrastructure projects that are likely to advertised to the firms on the Prequalified Sources List include a mix of border fence, border wall, border patrol roads, border access roads, border lights, border gates (for access to border monuments, for maintenance, and for Border Patrol operational use), border drainage improvements, levee walls, and other miscellaneous improvements, repairs, and alterations.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for procurements offered to firms on the Prequalified Sources list is 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction, which has a small business size standard of $36.5M.</p>
<p>Bonding Requirements (Specific to Individual "C" type Contracts to be Awarded): Pursuant to the Miller Act, Performance and Payment bonds shall be provided for each project awarded under the Prequalified Sources List. Notice to Proceed (NTP), will not be issued until after the selected offeror provides sufficient bonding to cover the work required as communicated under the project solicitation.</p>
<p>Process for Qualification: The Prequalified Sources List will be established by Fort Worth District. The projects intended to be awarded via solicitation to the Prequalified Sources List may be awarded by any USACE District.</p>
<p>An industry day conference will be held via webinar approximately 15 days after this announcement is posted and will be open to parties interested in being considered for inclusion in the Prequalified Sources List. Specific time and location will be announced via amendment to this posting within 72 hours of the initial announcement.</p>
<p>To be considered qualified for the Prequalified Sources List, firms must meet the following minimum requirements (additional information on required responses is detailed in the attached questionnaire including standards of acceptance where applicable):</p>
<p>Past Performance: Offerors are required to provide customer reference name(s), company affiliation and current contact information (phone number and email address) for the horizontal construction contract in the Contiguous United States with a contract price of $100M or more within the last 5 years (beginning from June 2013) (questionnaire item 3). <br /><br />For Federal projects submitted, the Offeror should submit finalized CCASS or CPARS reports, otherwise the customer reference(s) and contract information in response to the FBO questionnaire will be considered for the Offeror and its team members. Offerors&nbsp;may include relevant past performance information in the narrative submitted in response to item 7 on the questionnaire. This may include information for non-Federal projects at the discretion of the Offeror. <br /><br />Offerors should be aware provided information will be subject to verification. Offerors are advised that the Government could review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance including for projects other than those provided. Other potential sources that the Government may review include past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture or teaming arrangement) identified in the offeror's responses, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the Offeror. Offerors are also advised that the burden of providing accurate and relevant past performance information rests with the Offeror.</p>
<p>All firms submitting documentation meeting the standards for prequalification will be placed on the Prequalified Sources List and will receive fair opportunity to compete for each action advertised to the firms on the Prequalified of Sources List. As noted, the purpose of the Prequalified Sources List is to facilitate solicitation of several specific standalone "C" type contracts. All such contracts solicited from the Prequalified Sources List are expected to be Design-Build (DB) or Design-Bid-Build (DBB). Responses submitted to the Prequalification of Sources Questionnaire and associated narrative responses will not only be used to determine qualification for the Prequalified Sources List, but will also be used in Phase I of the two-step DB selection process.</p>
<p>The Government will provide all of the firms on the Prequalified Sources List notification of its intent to advertise a requirement. The notification will include a brief summary of the requirement, evaluation criteria for Phase I, general information about the evaluation criteria that will be used for the Phase II solicitation, and a request for each firm to provide the Government with a positive or negative statement of interest in proposing on the project. The government will not request additional information beyond confirmation of interest for the Phase I evaluation.</p>
<p>The firms will be provided a closing date by which they must respond positively or negatively to their interest in competing on the specific project. Any pre-qualified firm that fails to respond to the notification of intent within the allowed time will not be considered for award. The notification from the Government will also state that the Government will conduct its Phase I evaluation by considering information on hand; including the implementation approach narratives and past performance information provided to the Government in response to the Prequalification of Sources Announcement.</p>
<p>After the specified closing date for receipt of interest, the Government will consider each firm's competitive qualifications (implementation approach as provided during the prequalification selection process and past performance data), which will represent Phase 1 of the two-phase selection process. Up to 5 most highly qualified firms will be selected to submit Phase II proposals.</p>
<p>Project-specific Phase II solicitations will be sent to the most highly qualified firms.<br /><br />Any prequalified firm that expressed interest in the competitive Phase 1 process that is not included in the list of most highly qualified firms, may request a debrief from the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />Phase 2 Process:</p>
<p>The receipt of proposals due date will generally be 30 days after issuance of a project solicitation.</p>
<p>Selection will be based on Best Value Trade-Off (BVTO) or Low-Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedures. The solicitation may state an intention to award based on initial offers received without discussions. However, the Government will reserve the right to enter discussions if it is determined to be in the Governments best interest.</p>
<p>Each BVTO project solicitation will identify whether all evaluation factors other than price, when combined are (1) significantly more important that cost or price; (2) approximately equal to cost or price; (3) significantly less important that cost or price.</p>
<p>Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) Safe File Exchange: Phase II solicitations and Contractor proposals will be sent via AMRDEC safe file exchange.</p>
