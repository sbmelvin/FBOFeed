<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number 09SQ430025 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-30. This is a total small business set-aside under NAICS 212319 with an associated small business size standard of 500 employees.
CLIN 0001:Rock/Riprap Supply for theBitter Lake NWR Restoration ProjectDescription/Specifications/Scope of Work
Background Reclamation received a Biological Opinion from the US Fish and Wildlife Service on May 24, 2006.  As part of the Reasonable and Prudent Measures of the opinion to improve the habitat for the Pecos bluntnose shiner (shiner), a federally threatened species, Reclamation will,"?work with Federal, state, and private entities as a cooperating agency to support and enhance shiner habitat restoration at the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NWR)."  Reclamation chose to restore and optimize the interaction of river channel and floodplain habitats with available flows to an abandon oxbow (Oxbow 4), on the Bitter Lake NWR.  Reclamation will restore approximately 1.25 miles of riverine habitat to the oxbow, thus improving the habitat for the shiner.  
Objectives The objective of this contract is to provide approximately 1,000 cubic yards or equivalent tonnage of crushed rock (riprap) of a nominal 15 inch size, (12-18 inches in range), to the construction site for use as non-engineered levee protection along the outer wall of the oxbow.
Scope of the Requirement General - Activities within the scope of this contract include obtaining rock (blasting/digging, crushing, and sorting) from a Reclamation approved rock site quarry.  The quarry maybe a recommended or existing site, already being used by the Contractor, but is subject to a pre-contract inspection by Reclamation for safety, cultural and quality assurance.  The rock will be delivered (transported by the contractor), by whatever means necessary to meet contract needs and required dates (to be specified by Reclamation at a later date).  All contractor vehicles entering onto a federal worksite are subject to a pre-inspection for safety reasons.  All contractor vehicles and personnel are also subject to Reclamation Safety and Health Standards regulations.  
Geographical - All rock will be delivered to the Bitter Lake NWR work site at Oxbow 4 on marked routes.  The drivers will coordinate with the onsite foreman as to the specific location and position of the dump.  The contractor will also provide the dimensions of the vehicles to the on-site foreman prior to delivery for the best possible access and routing of the delivery when entering the refuge.  Some entrance and turning locations may be vehicle prohibitive depending on the width, height, and length of the vehicle.  
Description of Work - The contractor will obtain rock as specified below and deliver the rock to the Bitter Lake NWR worksite via approved routes.  The site foreman will provide a minimum of a 48-hour window for the contractor, when a delivery is to be made.  When the driver arrives on-site, he/she will coordinate with the foreman as to the specific location of the dump.  All safety concerns will be observed when on-site.  
Description of Materials - Rock fragments shall meet the following requirements as to quality (or subject to Reclamation inspector approval): 
"	Individual rock fragments shall be angular, dense, and sound, and resistant to abrasion and shall be free from cracks, seams and other defects that would tend to increase unduly their destruction by water and frost actions.  Rounded to subangular rock will not be permitted.
"	Materials shall meet the following requirements when tested according to the most recent American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards as specified below.  Samples shall be prepared and tested by the contractor in accordance with the applicable standards, and reports shall be submitted by the contractor for approval of materials before use.
Test	ASTM Designation	RequirementsSpecific gravity (saturated surface-dry basis)	C 97	Greater than 2.35Soundness (Sodium-sulphate method	C 88	Less than 10 percent loss of weight after 5 cyclesAbrasion (using Los Angeles machine grading A) 	C 131	Less than 30 percent loss of weight after 500 revolutions

	FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, AJA-47, FAA Headquarters 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues this market survey seeking industry sources to acquire approximately 100 Low Power/High Power Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) systems.  The FAA expects to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) during the 3rd quarter of FY2009 that will require a product operational capabilities test as part of the selection process.  Contract award is expected before the end of CY 2009.
The new procurement is needed to satisfy new/unfilled national airspace systems (NAS) requirements.  The purpose of this market survey is to gain awareness of industry capabilities and determine what commercial products already exist that meet or exceed DME requirements contained in the attached Performance Specification Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) FAA- E-2996.  
There are several new requirements in FAA-E-2996 that include a high power capability, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requirement for peak power density at the transponder antenna to be at least minus 103 dbW/m2 which was calculated by the government to be equal to minus 94dBm of output power at the input of receiver, and have the capability to adjust the power minus 4dBs in steps of minus 1dB at the output of the transmitter.  No National Airspace System operational requirements have or will be changed and no research and development is envisioned for this procurement.  Informal industry discussions indicate that multiple sources of commercial products may be available that meet or exceed these new requirements.
Interested industry sources must submit responses that demonstrate their DME systems satisfy the requirements of the DME performance specification.  Integrator/Team responses are welcome.  Three copies are requested.  The following technical information is requested: 
1.	Technical data, as appropriate, to demonstrate that available commercial products meet or exceed the DME specification; fifteen (15) page limit.
2.	Vendor corporate history, relevant contract experience that demonstrate ability to produce DME products and demonstrate ability to deploy these DME products in accordance with the attached Statement of Work; Five (5) page limit.
3.	Comments on FAA-E-2996; no page limit.
Responses containing only company brochures, catalogs or other type generic information will be considered unresponsive.  For the above criteria, all experience indicated shall include relevant experience over the last three years, including a brief description of the work performed, the contract number, the identification of the Government or commercial agency for which the work was performed (identify all efforts performed as a subcontractor); and the name, title and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.
For market survey purposes, only, interested industry sources must submit 1) their pricing for products that meet or exceed the DME specification and 2) their company's Business Size Standard and Socio-Economic Status.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Aeronautical, manufacturing.
All submissions received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter. Inquiries and responses received within thirty (30) days after the publication date of this notice will be considered.  
The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals at this time.  They are not desired and will not be accepted.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information/market survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding.  Electronic, telephonic and telegraphic responses will not be accepted.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirements to competition based upon response to this is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Respondents will not necessarily be notified of the results of the evaluation. 
Responses to this notice will be sent to the Contracting Officer, Attn: Don B. Terry, Federal Aviation Administration, AJA-47, 800 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC. 20591

<DESC>In 2006 several thousand acres of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were burned in the South End Complex Fire.  With that catastrophic event, fire burned area emergency stabilization funds were received for FY 07, and several treatments and stabilization projects were funded along with a Fire Rehabilitation Implementation Leader to implement fire rehab treatments and specifications.   Edward Gheen was hired in a one year term position as the Implementation Leader.  For the first few months, a major part of his time was spent disseminating information from the South End Complex and Basque Wells and Craters Fires Burned Area Emergency Stabilization Plan (ES plan).  Along with dissemination information from the ES plan, Ed had to interpret FWS fire policies involved with these processes.  As work on the implementation of the plan progressed a major part of Edward's job involved compiling monitoring information, field data, and general analysis of available information to write a Fire Rehabilitation plan which is an extension of the ES plan.  This plan encompassed the next two fiscal years and involved complex planning procedures, standards, and locations.  The plan was submitted for funding in FY 08, but was not funded due to budget deficiencies and Edward was let go after his term expired.  Later in FY 09 the Fire Rehabilitation Plan was funded and the Refuge has until the end of the Fiscal Year to complete the work in it.   The Refuge staff have knowledge of the plan and its specifications, but would have tremendous difficulty getting the plan implemented due to the time needed to sort through information that is relatively unfamiliar to them while trying to get any other Implementation Leader up to speed at the same time.
Edward Gheen is intimately familiar with every aspect of the FY 09 Malheur National Wildlife Refuge Fire Rehabilitation Plan and is the only person who can efficiently implement it and all of its parameters successfully.  Edward Gheen is the preferred contractor. 
Edward Gheen is a veteran owned small business.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Themis Computer Incorporated, 3185 Laurelview Court, Fremont, CA 94538 for the acquisition of three (3) RES-32DCO Rugged Enterprise Servers.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Themis Computer Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of these servers.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; s! o, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers. 
The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-09-T-9502.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 33411 with size standard of 1,000 employees.  The order shall be firm fixed priced with an expected delivery date on or around 19 Dec 2008.  The expected award date will be on or around 5 Dec 2008.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.  
In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT).  EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at http://nswcpc.navsea.navy.mil/contracts/ztable/open_actions.html.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCPC web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

This is intended as a sole source because Accellos is the owner/developer of the Radio Beacon Warehouse Management Control System product and source code.  Because they own the source code, we believe that Accellos, Inc. is the only vendor that can provide the required maintenance for the software.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Rapid Reaction Technology Office offers new, more streamlined ways to fund public and commercial ideas that meet its needs.  Currently, three needs are described below, and in full on a public website, DefenseSolutions.gov.   The best ideas will be funded quickly using flexible funding agreements.<BR><BR>The website - DefenseSolutions.gov. - explains these three needs fully and permits the public to send in its initial ideas about their development using a simplified form.  The form asks for a short description (abstract) of the idea, the technical basis for the idea, and how the idea will be matured into a prototype and tested.  All entries are free form and submitted electronically.  <BR><BR>Award of flexible funding agreements is planned for the best ideas submitted.  DoD will emphasize use of Other Transactions Authority (10 USC 2371; section 845, P.L. 103-160 as amended) to fund these ideas.  It is anticipated that multiple awards will be made, each typically less than $400,000, with emphasis on rapid production of prototypes based on the submitted ideas.  The solicitation of ideas is competitive and remains open until the requirements for prototypes are satisfied by awards or are withdrawn.  <BR><BR>Organizations or individuals submitting ideas via the website are not expected to be familiar with traditional government contracting procedures or requirements.  Flexible funding agreements will be individually negotiated.<BR><BR>The Rapid Reaction Technology Office seeks innovative companies, institutions, or individuals to develop three Battlefield Forensics items: a Multi-Test Kit (Explosives, Drugs, Heavy Metals/Gunshot Residue); a Handheld Sensitive Site Exploration Documentation Device; and a Digital Image Device Linkage at Warfighter Level.  <BR><BR>The Multi-Test Kit is a compact, rugged, simple-to-use presumptive test for the presence of 29 explosive compounds, 5 classes of drugs, and 3 heavy metals.<BR><BR>The Sensitive Site Exploration Documentation Device is a combination tool for rapid and precise collection of evidence.  It integrates the functions of a camera, digital tape recorder, distance measuring devices, label printer, GPS locator, and control software in a single compact unit.<BR><BR>The Digital Image Device interrogates cell phones to determine the origin of any stored images.<BR><BR>Complete need descriptions, specific capabilities desired, and expected technical performance for these three items are available at the DefenseSolutions.gov website, http://defensesolutions.gov.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the annual renewal of the SMART software license along with annual refresher training. The FAA must renew its license to use SMART software on an annual basis, and annual refresher training is necessary to update FAA users on new features, etc. The FAA contemplates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements Type contract with one base and four one year options to fulfill this requirement. Resource Analysis Corporation (RAC) is the proprietor of the SMART tool.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Resource Analysis Corporation, San Diego, CA, in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
The determination to solicitation and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated and supported by the fact that the technology underlying the SMART software tool is confidential and proprietary to RAC. 
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for Information Assurance Support to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD).  This requirement is for combined support in ongoing DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) / DoD Information Assurance Certification & Accreditation Process (DIACAP) efforts for the NSWC PCD.  The DITSCAP/DIACAP and ongoing Information Assurance (IA) efforts will need to be conducted on various Adaptive Persistent Awareness Systems (APAS), and related activities associated with these systems.  The effort includes IA policy and control evaluations, IA and network assessments, preparation of supporting DITSCAP/DIACAP documentation for each domain, implementation of security postures, and Subject Matter Expertise (SME) in IA life cycle management, coordination, implementation, deployment, and sustainment.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.
SCOPE:  NSWC PCD is looking for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses providing Information Assurance services.   The company must be knowledgeable in the following areas:1)  Interim DoD IA Certification & Accreditation Process: Signed Directive - Type Memo for DIACAP.  Jul 6, 2006  2)  Interim DoD IA Certification & Accreditation Process Guidance. Jul 6, 2006  3)  DIACAP Workflow Map. Jul 6, 2006  4)  Certification and Accreditation Requirements for DoD-wide Managed Enterprise Services Procurements, DoD Chief Information Officer memorandum.  Jun 22, 2006
DITSCAP, as well as NIST 800-37 Certification and Accreditation (C&A) are processes for the identification of security risks and vulnerabilities, the agreement of corrective action plans, and their achievement for obtaining authorization to operate.  
C&A is typically required for connection to Department of Defense, and other Federal systems, networks, and applications.  DITSCAP is a process, not a technology, that  includes numerous supporting technologies within its framework.  NIST800-37 is now being required by most Federal Agencies for themselves and their subcontractors.  Contractor support is required to implement these requirements.
The company must have the following capabilities:1)  The documentation required to meet DITSCAP, DIACAP, Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC) and/or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) accreditation requirements for APAS and associated systems.2)  A Certification Test and Evaluation of associated systems, includinga)  Security Certification Test and Evaluation (CT&E) Plan meeting all DITSCAP/DIACAP requirements that ensures that all system security measures are demonstrated.b)  A Certification Analysisc)  Software component level security performance testing and system level vulnerability scanning against the associated system workstations, servers, and routers based on the approved CT&E Plan.3)  System level Security Test and Evaluation of associated systems, including:a)  Security Test and Evaluation (ST&E) Planb)  Security Test and Evaluation4)  Network security assessments, and the development and implementation of network protection plans.5)  Security engineering-related technical consultation to include expert assessment of access control systems and methodology, application and file security, security practices, hostile intrusion detection and prevention, logical and physical security, public key infrastructure, network architecture, information assurance (authentication and integrity), and virtual private networks.6)  NSWC PCD software engineering and systems engineering expertise for software related activities; NSWC PCD by reviewing the development, implementation, configuration, and testing of software applications and hardware system design; provide assistance to NSWC PCD on future wireless implementations; and engineering assistance on the integration and development of both GOTS and COTS products.7)  IA-related network engineering and systems engineering to include the design and implementation of classified and unclassified Local Area Networks/Wide Area Networks (LAN/WAN).   Research and develop new policies, procedures, and system designs to support IA requirements. This may include the investigation and evaluation of commercial practices, COTS/GOTS products, and new emerging technologies, such as Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); the development of white papers; and recommendations for the implementation of new "best practices".

<a href="mailto:lisa.d.duncan@us.army.mil">US Army Aviation and Missile Command (Missile)</a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued pursuant to FAR 15.2. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. The Army is continually developing and evaluating fuzes for various missile and munition applications. To prevent inadvertent or premature weapon initiation, these fuzes include components that prevent arming until certain criteria have been met. In addition to other physical phenomena, fuzes often use the acceleration associated with the launch and flight of a weapon to make a decision to arm the weapon. A centrifuge allows the acceleration-sensing parts of the fuze to be tested in a controlled, laboratory environment, by simulating those launch and flight accelerations. For the purposes of testing fuzes or other test articles as desired, such a centrifuge should have at least the following characteristics: 1. Accommodate different fuzes by means of an adapter plate using a standard bolt pattern; 2. Accommodate test articles with maximum dimensions of 17 x 17 x 17 centimeters; 3. Accommodate test articles with maximum mass of 2.5 kilograms (approximately 5.5 pounds); 4. Provide for automatic load balancing by adjusting of the position of a counterweight; 5. The test fixture and all rotating parts should be completely enclosed, with the enclosure adequate to contain all fragments from a worst-case mishap where the fuze under test either breaks apart or the explosive materials in the fuze detonate (assume 10.0 grams net explosive mass, TNT equivalent); 6. The centrifuge should provide for closed-loop control of velocity at the center of mass of the test article ranging from zero to 260 revolutions per minute (rpm) in increments of one rpm with an accuracy of plus or minus 0.5 rpm. Higher maximum spin ratings would be of interest; 7. Controls for the centrifuge settings must accommodate remote operation via a standard electrical interface (for example, EIA/RS-232, EIA/RS-422, EIA/RS-485, IEEE 802.3/Ethernet, IEEE-488/GPIB). As a minimum, the centrifuge controls should indicate centrifuge spin rate in revolutions per second (rps). All local control readouts should be readable in daylight light intensity levels; 8. The centrifuge should meet all requirements while operating in ambient temperatures from 55 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and after storage in temperatures from 20 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, with relative humidity levels ranging from 20 to 95 percent; 9. The centrifuge should be powered from standard three-prong, 120 Vac, sixty-hertz, single-phase electrical outlet and should include built-in power conditioning and filtering, fail-safe circuit breaker protection (designed to trip when more than 15 amperes, root mean square, is drawn), and provisions for physical lockout/tagout procedures for maintenance/repair safety. A centrifuge requiring a higher voltage, but standard, single-phase circuit (e.g., 240 Vac) would be considered; 10. Maximum diameter of the centrifuge should be approximately 1.5 meters ( 5 feet) assuming roughly circular shape when viewed from above, with maximum height being roughly comparable, or less; 11. Access to the test fixture and rotating parts while the centrifuge is spinning should be prevented by the incorporation of hardware-based interlocks, the opening of which should result in immediate but graceful braking of the test fixture and rotating parts to a complete stop in less than one second. Options for braking (fast braking, slow braking, or no braking) may be useful. Similar provisions will be included to automatically bring the centrifuge to safe condition in the event of facility electrical power outage or undervoltage condition. An Semergency stop on the front of the centrifuge should provide a similar emergency shutdown function. The Semergency stop should have appropriate mechanical guard on it to keep it from being inadvertently actuated during normal loading/unloading/inspection operations but should not preclude its immediate actuation when needed; 12. The centrifuge should provide automatic indication of Sunbalanced conditions that would lead to excessive wear of the rotating or drive elements or that would cause a safety hazard to the operator. SSevere unbalanced conditions should result in automatic graceful braking of the centrifuge to a complete stop; 13. The centrifuge should include a safety plug or key that the operator would remove from the control panel during loading, unloading, and inspection operations. The centrifuge drive circuits should be incapable of being energized while plug or key is out of the control panel; 14. The centrifuge controls should include a power-up reset and power-on self-test (POST) capability as well as a calibration routine using a standard test mass; 15. As an option for consideration, the centrifuge should allow for installation of a Sspinner mechanism onto the test fixture, the purpose of which is to simulate the rolling motion of a missile, rocket, or projectile in flight. The spinner should spin the test article clockwise or counterclockwise, as desired, about the axis intersecting the center of rotation of the centrifuge. Spin rate should be controlled in increments of 0.1 revolutions per second (rps) over a range of zero to fifteen rps for clockwise or counterclockwise direction, as desired. The use of the spinner will be restricted to small, less massive test articles with maximum dimensions of 8 x 8 x 8 centimeters and maximum mass of 0.7 kilograms (approximately 1.5 lbs). Operation of the spinner should be independent of the centrifuge. Safety interlocks described earlier would also apply to the spinner; 16. It is a desirable objective that the centrifuge and the spinner be controlled with either pre-set or event-driven profiles via standard computer interface for higher fidelity to launch and flight environments. Compatibility with National Instruments LabVIEW version 8 or later is preferred; 17. The centrifuge should provide for slip-ring or other mechanism to provide reliable electrical connections between the fuze under test and external instrumentation. A minimum of sixteen connections is desired, with the internal cabling of each connection being shielded, and with an option to connect the shield to the fuze under test. All connectors should be of standard type commonly used in electrical instrumentation (for example, BNC, Sbanana jack, or terminal strip) and should not require special tools or fasteners to use. Each connection should be electrically isolated from the other; 18. It is a desirable objective that the centrifuge include a camera and associated lighting that would provide for local and/or remote viewing of the inside of the centrifuge. If the camera cannot be emplaced on the rotating arm of the centrifuge, a stroboscopic system could be used to present the operator with a Sstationary view of the fuze under test. Other suitable methods for visually monitoring the article under test, including the ability to record onto standard video tape or standard digital media, would be of interest; 19. All metallic structures in the centrifuge that the operator could come into contact with under regular use conditions should be bonded to Searth ground through a resistance with a minimum value of 25 kilohms, maximum value of one megohm, in accordance with Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM 385-64) to preclude electrostatic discharge hazards; 20. The base of the centrifuge should have provisions for mounting to a flat concrete floor using standard bolts, and should include a means for leveling the centrifuge and securely locking it into leveled position, using standard, commonly available tools; 21. The centrifuge should be constructed to allow safe cleanup and removal of debris, fragments, and dust from articles under test; 22. The centrifuge should have provisions for the attachment of an externally driven vent system to exhaust residual vapors from the test article; 23. The centrifuge should be constructed using industry standard, commonly available, and/or easily fabricated parts, and in a modular fashion to simplify maintenance and repair; 24. All parts of the centrifuge that are toggled, adjusted, or otherwise actuated or moved as part of the normal operational sequence should be designed for long wear life and should degrade gracefully, with indications of need for replacement well in advance of failure. As a minimum, all motor brushes should be of a standard, easily-obtained (commercial, Soff-the-shelf) type and designed for ease of replacement. Please note that centrifuge designs that do not quite meet the above listed requirements may still be of interest if there is a potential decrease in cost or delivery time, or if there is a potential increase in reliability, safety, or performance. Aspects of the design that are proprietary or have usage restrictions such as licensing requirements or restrictions on modifications or operator servicing should be clearly identified.

The SCoE brings together these schools, and as a single organization is responsible for nearly all Army sustainment training, leader education, and associated combat developments.  However combat and training developments are not part of the requirements, only training and training support.  Included on the SCoE is the establishment of the ALU, which consolidated all of the Armys logistics professional military education, included Officer and Warrant basic and advanced course training (Officer Basic Course, Combined Logistics Captains Career Course, Warrant Officer Basic Course, and Warrant Officer Advanced Course), Noncommissioned Officer Academy (NCOA) course training, professional development, and functional training for military and civilians.  <BR><BR>All three schools (Ordnance, Quartermaster, and Transportation) are responsible for technical training of Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Soldiers, noncommissioned officers, warrant officers, officers, civilians, and foreign military.  Ordnance School trains in the fields of material maintenance and integrated material management of combating fire power and ground mobility material, logistics management (ammunition supply, maintenance, and life cycle), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and combat support and combat service support tests.  Quartermaster School trains supply, field services, aerial delivery, and mortuary affairs.  Transportation School trains current and future Army transportation capability, Intermodal Operations, Maritime, and rail.  The ALU trains the Armys logistics officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, civilians, and foreign military in professional military education, functional, materiel, and distribution management.   This anticipated requirement is to provide training and training support to augment personnel in the schools whose mission it is to train, educate, and support training.  Requirement includes extensive technical knowledge and instructor qualifications in order to use TRADOC approved programs of instruction (POIs); to be in compliance with government defined instructor to student-ratios; to provide classroom instruction; hands-on performance oriented training, simulation/virtual training, and/or field exercise training or combative driven scenario training.  Technical expertise includes all functional areas identified by each school/proponent.<BR><BR>Anticipated instructor and training support requirements exist at Fort Lee, VA and Fort AP Hill as well as any location where Ordnance, Transportation, and Quartermaster training occur.  Locations for temporary or full time support include: Fort Pickett, VA, Fort Story, VA, Fort Belvoir, VA (and some surrounding areas), Langley AFB, VA, Craney Island Naval Facility, Norfolk Naval Base Facilities, Giant Refinery, VA, Roanoke Water Authority, VA, Appomattox Water Authority, VA, Mobile Training Teams at locations identified by Task Order, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD, Redstone Arsenal, AL, Fort Sill, OK, Fort Bliss, TX, Fort Gordon, GA, Eglin AFB, FL, and Fort Leonard Wood, MO.<BR><BR>Anticipated requirement requires comprehensive Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) knowledge for the presentation of specific subject matter.  This academic instruction includes platform and hands-on instructional in resident and field training environments based on POIs.  Academic instruction includes but is not limited to classroom/laboratory/field/conference discussion, demonstration and practical and simulation exercises; includes administering written and performance hands-on based tests; and conducting critiques.  Academic and training instructors must possess fundamentals on being an instructor. Indirect instructional classroom and student support includes preparing classrooms and equipment for training; retrieving course documents, preparing training materials for instruction; performing remedial training support; assisting with administration functions associated with in processing, graduating, and recording grades of students; conducting counseling; grading examinations; and evaluating student performance; and maintaining classroom control.<BR><BR>Anticipated requirements for qualified personnel to support various training events of Logistics Warrior Training Exercise, Convoy Live Fire Exercise and range training operations.  These training events could occur in a classroom, during a field exercise, or live fire exercises, and may occur outside normal duty hours.  These training events are classified as training and training support, not combat and training development.<BR><BR>For training support, the anticipated requirements include augmenting Logistics Warrior staff in planning and executing a multi-echelon field training exercise, serving as qualified Observer Controllers familiar with Skill Level 10 through 40 Common Tasks (STPs 21-1/24-SMCT) and staff function operations.  Providing small arms/artillery repairs on the training site, range, and classroom, and providing trainers for the marksmanship training simulator including the Laser Convoy Counter Ambush Training System (LCCATS); Laser Marksmanship Training System (LMTS) and the Engagement Skills Trainer 2000 (EST 2000).

<SOLNBR>CP-02-11-09
<RESPDATE>022609
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>
<p>Proposed addition of Waste Receptacles to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.</p>
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Waste Receptacles by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7240-00-151-6630 Waste Receptacle Plastic 44 gallon grey waste receptacle with<br />Removable cover 32 height and 24 diameter</p>
<p>7240-00-151-6629 Waste Receptacle Plastic 32 gallon grey waste receptacle with <br />removable cover. 28 height and 22 diameter</p>
<p>7240-00-139-7521 Waste Receptacle Plastic 44 gallon grey waste receptacle with <br />removable cover 32.25 height and 23.75 diameter</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, Fort Worth, TX<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Waste Receptacles to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>None identified.</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Wiper, Laminated to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 26, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0030. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>The National Science Foundation intends to solicit and award a follow-on contract to JMS, Marine Science & Technology Center, Groton, CT on a sole-source basis, for continued naval architect support of the management, analysis and evaluation of the United States Coast Guard Icebreaker maintenance and recapitalization program.  The contractor will support the review and analysis of Polar icebreaker multiyear and other significant vessel maintenance, recapitalization, or upgrade projects and configuration changes that affect the Required Operating Capabilities; support NSF in working with the Coast Guard regarding recommendations for improvements to the scientific equipment aboard the Polar Icebreakers; and provide recommendations relating to future methodologies for cost sharing and management of the Polar Icebreaking Fleet.  A performance period of 12 months is anticipated, from March 1, 2009 through February 28, 2010, at an estimated value of $75,000. Based upon information available at this time, NSF considers JMS to be the only responsible source per the statutory authority at 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

NSF will evaluate all responses to determine if the vendor is qualified and able to perform the required services for the stated period without adverse affect. Please direct all inquiries to the contracting officer.  NSF has appointed an ombudsman to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors in the conduct of its acquisition activities. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer; therefore, before consulting with any ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations in writing to the contracting officer for resolution. If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the ombudsman.

<DESC>1. Contracting Activity.  The contracting activity responsible for this acquisition in support of TRICARE Management Activity is:<BR><BR>   U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA)<BR>   820 Chandler Street<BR>   Fort Detrick, MD<BR><BR>2.  Description of Action.  Approval is being requested for a new, sole source, firm fixed price contract for membership into the American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP).  The acquisition will be funded using FY09 O&M funding.<BR><BR>3.  Description of Services. One 12-month base period is expected with four 12-month options. <BR>This award provides for membership for 16 selected Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in a national surgical quality improvement program that supports data collection by trained specialists, data analysis with national comparative data, and continual data display for individual facility, service (Air Force, Army, and Navy), and Department of Defense (DoD) system level aggregate data. This program provides MHS leadership with the ability to maintain constant oversight of the surgical care provided in the participating MTFs and assist in determining if the actual surgical outcomes are consistent with the risk adjusted expected outcomes.<BR><BR>4.  Authority Cited.  The statutory authority for this requirement is 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)iii -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<BR><BR>5.  Reason for Authority Cited. There is no other existing entity that offers the services required to successfully compare DoD surgical data to like public sector national data. ACS NSQIP is the only nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care available to non VA hospitals.  The ACS NSQIP was established in 2004 and is the industry standard for comparison of risk adjusted national surgical data.  The program employs a prospective, peer controlled, validated database to quantify 30-day risk-adjusted surgical outcomes. This allows valid comparison of outcomes among all hospitals in the program. Participating hospitals and their surgical staff are provided with the tools, reports, analysis, and support necessary to make informed decisions about improving quality of care. <BR> <BR>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  No effort will be made to solicit from potential sources as there is only one possible source. <BR><BR>7.  Actions to Increase Competition.  No actions will be taken to increase competition. However the requirement will be reviewed periodically.<BR><BR>8.  Market Survey.  The Program Office conducted an internet search of like products on or about 9 December 2008. This search revealed no existing sources that could provide a like tool that could meet the requirements of the SOW.  <BR><BR>9.  Interested Sources.  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.<BR>The notice required by FAR 5.201 shall be published on the Government-wide point-of-entry (FedBizOps), and any requests for participation in the requirement will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal.<BR><BR>10.  Other Factors.  This is a follow-on award.<BR><BR>a.  Procurement history.  <BR><BR>(1)  Contract numbers and dates of the last award: W81XWH-07-P-1028, awarded 29 Sep 2007.<BR><BR>(2)  Competitive status of these actions:  Sole Source <BR><BR>(3)  Authority for less than full and open competition previously used:  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) or 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  As cited in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <BR><BR>(4)  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, provide a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results.  <BR><BR>There is no other existing entity that offers the services required to successfully compare DoD surgical data to like public sector national data. ACS NSQIP is the only nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care available to non VA hospitals.<BR><BR>(5)  If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, provide a detailed explanation of the changed circumstances.  NA <BR><BR>(6)  Provide an explanation of any unusual patterns which may be revealed by the history, e.g., several consecutive, urgent buys. NA<BR><BR>(7)  If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes.  <BR><BR>a.  Acquisition Data Availability.  To date, no other vendor provides a product that meets the requirements of the MHS: nationally validated, risk-adjusted, outcomes-based program to measure and improve the quality of surgical care, or allows the MHS to customize products based on the needs of the local MHS.  <BR><BR>b.  Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  NA<BR><BR>c.  Subcontracting Competition. Not applicable.<BR><BR>

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 

(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 

(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the
lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 

(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 

(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 

(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 

(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows:<br />2009 NOAA HONOR AWARDS CEREMONY<br />A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Each spring, NOAA holds its Honor Awards ceremony to recognize winners of the Bronze Medal and Distinguished Career Awards. This event consists of light morning refreshments beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m. and lasting until about 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>B. DATE OF CEREMONY</p>
<p>EITHER Tuesday, April 7, 2009 OR Wednesday, April 22, 2009. <br /><br />*Please note that we require use of the venue the day prior to the event for set-up. This means full access to the stage and seating area beginning no later than 10:00 am and commencing at 6:00 p.m. on the day before the ceremony, whichever date is selected.</p>
<p>C. VENUE LOCATION</p>
<p>The ceremony must take place within a reasonable distance (within walking distance of a Metro station) from the NOAA Silver Spring Campus (intersection of East-West Highway and Colesville Road) or the Herbert C. Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. (Constitution Ave. and 14th St., NW).</p>

<p>We require seating in rows, theater-style for 550 individuals.</p>

There will be limited seating (seating for between 60 and 100, even though 500-550 people will be eating). The refreshments will preferably be set-up in an area separate from where the awards ceremony will occur. However, NOAA will consider holding its reception in the same room as the ceremony.

The morning refreshments should, at a minimum, consist of bagels and/or muffins, pastries and/or cakes, cookies, fresh fruit, coffee/tea, juice and water.</p>
<p>Following the ceremony-beginning approximately at 11:45 a.m.--will be a dessert reception to take place in the same area as the morning reception. Much of the food from the morning reception can remain and also be supplemented by some more dessert selections (brownies, petit fours, etc.). The desserts will be presented buffet-style with limited seating (not necessarily enough to accommodate all participants).</p>
<p>F. CEREMONY REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The venue should be of such a size that it can accommodate a reception and awards ceremony for 550 guests. During the ceremony, the 550 attendees will be seated in rows facing a stage or raised platform. This raised platform or stage is used to seat at least three NOAA dignitaries, as well as to present the awards. On stage, NOAA will require the use of runner carpets (1 or 2), unless the stage is already carpeted. NOAA will also require the use of staircases next to each side of the stage so that recipients can easily (and safely) access the stage when receiving awards.</p>
<p>NOAA will need to rent drapery to pipe and drape the stage and create a "backstage" area so that the awards can be stored out of sight during the ceremony.</p>
<p><br />G. REGISTRATION</p>
<p>On the day of the ceremony, the awards recipients are required to sign-in at registration tables. These registration tables must be set-up outside of the reception/ceremony area (but it must be indoors) so that when most of the recipients enter the venue, they will first come upon the registration tables. NOAA will require six 8' rectangular registration tables skirted with royal blue (or equivalent) and white linens. The registration area must be large enough to accommodate lines of at least 30 people. These registration tables must be set-up and skirted by 12:00 p.m. on the day prior to the ceremony.</p>
<p><br />H. COAT RACKS AND STORAGE</p>
<p>Since many of the ceremony attendees will be traveling in from out of town, NOAA will require the use of a room or area to store luggage and bags during the event. This area should also contain at least one coat rack for guests to use. This coat and bag area should be close to the reception and ceremony room(s).</p>
<p>I. FLOWERS</p>
<p>The stage must contain either floral arrangements or blooming plants. These floral arrangements/plants must be set-up by 3:30 p.m. on the day prior to the ceremony. The estimated size of the plants is about one foot to 18 inches. The estimated number of plants needed for the stage is between 10 and 18 depending on the size of the stage.</p>
<p><br />J. AUDIO-VISUAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>NOAA ceremonies usually consist of a visual presentation (usually a PowerPoint projected onto a screen), which follows the ceremony script. The requirements for these presentations are as follows:</p>
<p>Audio<br />&bull;Executive-style podium on stage or platform for addressing audience<br />&bull;Computer audio input for house playback<br />&bull;Mic input for house playback (preferably wireless) and mic (not wireless) for national anthem singer<br />&bull;Speaker system</p>
<p>Video<br />&bull;Computer video playback through two simultaneous projectors on two, large wall-mounted screens (if not wall-mounted, screens must be elevated and next to stage facing audience)<br />&bull;Live feeds to projector<br />&bull;Ability to switch video feeds (live camera feed vs. computer video) to projector</p>
<p>Lighting<br />&bull;Theatrical lighting typical for stage switchable among presets.</p>
<p>All A/V equipment must be set up by 1:00 p.m. on the day prior to the ceremony.</p>
<p>K. BASIS FOR AWARD</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

<p>"After-relieved tax," means any amount of tax or duty, other than an excepted tax, that would otherwise have been payable on the transactions or property covered by this contract, but which the Contractor is not required to pay or bear, or for which the Contractor obtains a refund, as the result of legislative, judicial, or administrative action taking effect after the contract date.</p>

<p>(d) The contract price shall be increased by the amount of any after-imposed tax or of any tax or duty specifically excluded from the contract price by a provision of this contract that the Contractor is required to pay or bear, including any interest or penalty, if the Contractor states in writing that the contract price does not include any contingency for such tax and if liability for such tax, interest, or penalty was not incurred through the Contractor's fault, negligence, or failure to follow instructions of the Contracting Officer or to comply with the provisions of paragraph (i) below.</p>
<p>(e) The contract price shall be decreased by the amount of any after-relieved tax, including any interest or penalty.

<p>52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER-CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)</p>
<p>(a) Method of payment. (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.</p>
<p>(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either--</p>
<p>(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or</p>
<p>(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).</p>
<p>(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210.</p>
<p>(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply.</p>
<p>(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for--</p>
<p>(i) Making a correct payment;</p>
<p>(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and</p>
<p>(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.</p>
<p>(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--</p>
<p>(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.</p>
<p>(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System.</p>
<p>(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent.</p>
<p>(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database.</p>

When passes are required for non-government affiliated persons, the contractor provides appropriate point of contact poc's names, passport, and social security numbers no less than eight days prior to the scheduled event to the pass and I.D. office so authorizations can be obtained.<br />12. The contractor holder or commissioner (can be same as contract holder) is responsible for scheduling officials to work games. The Youth Sports Office will be notified immediately of any commissioner changes. The name of this person and an alternate will be designated in writing to the contracting office prior to the start of contract performance.

If a game or portion of a game must be replayed due to a valid protest on a rule misinterpretation or inappropriate call made by an official, the officials will be obligated to fulfill officiating responsibilities for that replayed portion of the game and will not be paid for the replayed portion.</p>
<p>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GOVERNMENT <br />1. The Youth Sports program shall provide all equipment and supplies necessary for teams to play the sport (balls, time clock, score books, etc.) In addition the Youth Sports Program will also provide the field or court space, time and scrimmage teams for contractor to conduct an official's clinic.<br />2.

This schedule shall include all pertinent information necessary for the officials to conduct the games such as rules modifications. <br />5. When games are not played due to a forfeit by a team because a team did not have the required number of players to start, the officials shall be paid only &frac12; of the regular game fee for game/s that are not worked but forfeited. This is provided that the officials were at the game site at the scheduled start time for the game. Official forfeit time for a team is 10 minutes after scheduled game time. <br />6. If it is becoming apparent that weather might be a factor in creating unsafe playing conditions, the decision to cancel, postpone or reschedule a game, will be made by the Youth Sports office staff only. This will be done at the earliest by 1500 hours or 2 hours prior to the scheduled game time on the day in which the game was to be played. If weather becomes a factor during game play, again the responsibility to cancel, delay or postpone the game will be made by the Youth Sports office staff person only. Officials working games which are not fully concluded at the time of postponement or cancellation will be paid for a full game if more than half the game was booked and the game is considered an "official" game. If a smaller portion of the game was conducted the officials will be paid only &frac12; of a regular or full game fee. <br /><br />7. Officials will not be paid for cancelled games if notified by the Youth Sports office when at least 1 hour prior notice is given to contract holder or commissioner on the day that the competition was to be officiated. The Youth Sports program office shall notify the contract holder or commissioner of all postponed or cancelled games with at least 1 hour prior notice or in some cases at 1600 hours on the game day when the first game is scheduled to be played at 1700. It is then the contract or commissioners responsibility to contact scheduled officials to notify them of the cancellation.</p>
<p>8. Rescheduled games which have been postponed due to weather or safety conditions will be rescheduled by the Youth Sports staff only. Notification of the rescheduled games will be provided the contract holder or commissioner no less than two days or 48 hours prior to the competition so that the contractor or commissioner may have ample time to find officials to work the rescheduled games.</p>

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.

  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent' each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

<CONTACT>Phyllis A Targett, Clinical Analyst, Phone 937-257-9075, Email phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>A. General Information<br />The Heartland Region seeks to initiate a standardization process for Elastic Bandage Wraps under the Regional Standardization Program. The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region, based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. The seven facilities in the region include Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox, Kentucky, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Naval Hospital Corps School Great Lakes Illinois, and USCG Air Station Traverse City, Michigan. Standardization action for this product line represents a new initiative.
<p>Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFQ). Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed in 1a of the Technical Criteria below, will be disqualified in Phase I. This product line includes but is not limited to the following Elastic Bandage Wraps: ELASTIC BANDAGE ,MATRIX, 4X5YD, ELASTIC BANDAGE, MATRIX,6X5YD, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL, PRM 3IN ELASTIC BANDAGE, KNIT W/2" DOUBLE VELCRO CLOSURE 6"X 5.5 YARD LATEX-FREE, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 4IN, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 3IN, LATX FREE X-TEN ELAS COMPR BANDAGE NON-STERILE W/DBL SELF CLOSURE 4"X 210" STRETCHD, BEIGE. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes/applications listed.</p>
<p>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Regions current PV Owens &amp; Minor. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their products. This RFQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement to the PV Program and it is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCP's PV program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil</p>
<p>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is July 2009. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.<br />Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>B. Products and Performance Required<br />The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Elastic Bandages, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $56,460.10. This forecast is based on historical CDMIA sales for a 12-month period. The top-ten (10) high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below. At the request of the Heartland Regional MTF's vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, PV order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products provided by the vendor.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937) 257-9075. All e-mail communication between vendors and the Region must be digitally signed. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well. Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date of this RFQ. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.</p>
<p>This process will include vendor requirements for providing electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above their initial submission, best price submissions, and literature or other requested information have actually arrived at the Heartland Region Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via e-mail. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.</p>
<p>D. Evaluation Criteria<br />The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the MTF's within the Heartland Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Heartland Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendors without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Heartland Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.</p>
<p>Phase I-Technical/Company Evaluation Process<br />Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their "intent to participate" to the above POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB by the Clinical Product Team (CPT), to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will qualify and be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. In general, "acceptability" for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendor's responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendor's information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of "technical acceptability." The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required. All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:<br />1. Vendors must provide a complete line of Elastic Bandages products for single use. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: ELASTIC BANDAGE ,MATRIX, 4X5YD, ELASTIC BANDAGE,MATRIX,6X5YD, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL, PRM 3IN ELASTIC BANDAGE, KNIT W/2" DOUBLE VELCRO CLOSURE 6"X 5.5 YARD LATEX-FREE, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 4IN, MEDC BANDAGE ELAST KNT VEL STD 3IN, LATX FREE X-TEN ELAS COMPR BANDAGE NON-STERILE W/DBL SELF CLOSURE 4"X 210" STRETCHD, BEIGE, <br />2. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes (some of the sizes above within each product line may be similar or not applicable due to the item being available as a universal (one size fits all) category) and styles listed. Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />3. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Elastic Bandages product line including Latex Free with Velcro Closure, Sterile and Unsterile. Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in response to this RFQ. (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified). <br />4. Vendors must have a separate agreement with the current Prime Vendor for the Heartland Region, Owens &amp; Minor, for distribution in the Heartland Region. (Note a vendor whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<br />5. Vendors must provide their 4-Digit Prime Vendor Number in response to this RFQ. If unknown, contact Owens and Minor.<br />6. Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.<br />7. Vendors MUST provide latex free Elastic Bandages. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of latex safe/free items supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.<br />8. Vendors MUST provide Velcro closure Elastic Bandages. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of Velcro closure Elastic Bandage Wraps supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal<br />9. Vendors MUST provide Unsterile and Sterile Elastic Bandages. Vendors MUST provide a complete list of Unsterile and Sterile Elastic Bandages supplied (catalog, etc.) in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.</p>
<p>Phase II-Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Price Analysis Process: Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are selected to progress to clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested.</p>
<p>Clinical Evaluation Process: For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. All vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.</p>
<p>Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendor's product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient-care setting using a Likert-like scale, with a one to five rating. The scale descriptors are: 1 = strongly disagree, 2=disagree, 3=neutral, 4=agree and 5 = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 21 calendar days. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization. The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors' average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors' average scores). In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold. Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted clinical/performance criteria outlined below.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Criteria:<br />1. Patient Safety-Product unrolls evenly and lies flat upon application. (Maintain even layers of woven materials, avoiding clumping, creasing or bunching of layers, which would put unequal compression on the patient).<br />a) The wrap woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together during the application.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <br />c) The evaluators will apply the bandage wrap on each other, rolling the wraps in the acceptable circular application. The expectation is that the woven material will not clump, crease or bunch together and cause uneven compression and pain to the patient.<br />2. Patient Safety- Product maintains therapeutic elasticity throughout a reapplication - removal of bandage wrap and rewrapping the same bandage wrap. (Loss of elasticity will require a tighter rewrapping and uneven therapeutic compression).<br />a) The bandage wrap will retain elasticity (elastic memory) when the bandage wrap is removed and reapplied.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product. <br />c) The expectation is that the bandage wrap will retain therapeutic elastic memory and provide therapeutic equal compression.<br />3. Patient Safety and maintenance of therapeutic application for the patient- The Velcro closure adheres securely and evenly. (Secure and evenly attached closure is critical to the bandage wrap remaining in place).<br />a) The Velcro closure will adhere to the woven material securely and evenly. No gaps between the Velcro and the woven material.<br />b) This criterion will be evaluated by the clinician performing the application of the product.<br />c) The expectation is that the Velcro closure will adhere securely and evenly against the woven material, eliminating the possibility that the bandage wrap will become loose or fall off; thereby, loosing the therapeutic effects of the product. <br /><br />Price Analysis Process:</p>
<p>1. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Heartland Region. Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes. Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).<br />2. Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with the potential for three (3) one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).<br />3. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.<br />4. The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis: <br />a. Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs) to include analysis to determine cost savings, if any, relative to historical spending.<br />b. Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time). <br />c. Impact of Unmatched Lines (i.e., do the unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor?); and<br />d. Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period. Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.</p>
<p>The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.</p>

The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is soliciting information to identify possible sources to become the sustaining organization for the Guardian Angel (GA) Weapon System throughout the Air Force to include: Lead commands; Air Combat Command (ACC); and user commands: Pacific Air Forces Command (PACAF), US Air Forces Europe (USAFE), Air Education Training Command (AETC), Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG). The contractor shall provide total support for the following systems which includes maintenance, repairs, training, personnel, spares, supply support, packaging, handling, storage and transportation (PHS&amp;T), and user manuals for the sustainment of all GA equipment designated in this document. The facilities to house the contractor will be made available by associated Lead/User Commands. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commit the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information for this RFI is voluntary, and participants will not be compensated.</p>
<p>2. Respondents to this RFI should describe their ability to meet and/or exceed the objectives listed in paragraph 3 below.<br />3. The contractor will be responsible for the sustainment (maintenance and upkeep) of the following GA Subsystems:<br />a. Precision Aerial Delivery Systems (Personnel and Equipment) to include associated GA life support equipment (oxygen, targeting, and associated individual life support equipment) that support the aerial insertion/delivery of GA capabilities. This includes high altitude low open (HALO), high altitude high open (HAHO), low level static line, tandem systems, and aerial cargo delivery systems (ballistic cargo chutes and Joint Precision Aerial Delivery Systems) and associated rigging support/equipment.<br />b. Technical Rescue Equipment. GA technical recovery equipment, to include environmental hazard sensors, emergency escape equipment, personal protection equipment, confined space hardware, extrication tools, and self contained breathing apparatus. <br />c. Maritime Rescue Equipment. Maritime rescue vehicles and associated mission equipment [Submersible engines, aids to navigation, fuel systems, rafts, rescue baskets, rescue devices, markers/beacons, inflatable boats, advance rescue craft (modified personal watercraft) and training support watercraft/communications systems] required for AF/GA Humanitarian and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Maritime Missions. <br />d. Search Sonar. The Sonar system consists of three components: side scan sonar, sector sonar and portable sonar w/integrated mask and heads-up display system. The systems are used to search, locate and recover isolated personnel/material in poor visibility and/or contaminated underwater conditions. <br />e. Dive Recovery Equipment. Subsurface SCUBA systems to include individual protection suits and associated equipment, dive tanks, regulators, flotation devices, underwater communications systems, dry suits, search equipment (search sonar, ropes, timing devices, markers) and subsurface recovery equipment. <br />f. Rescue Vehicles. Light, air-droppable, and interoperable with integrated command &amp; control capabilities, with a higher payload and increased survivability/force protection than current vehicle solutions. <br />g. Weapons / Munitions. GA weapons to include munitions and associated targeting devices (laser designators, sights/scopes, target marking devices, and associated adjuncts (lights, rails). <br />h. Guardian Angel Operations (GAO) Kit. GA information management and data-link systems to include radios, computers, data/voice communications systems, and blue force trackers required to increase situational awareness, reduce operational risks, and improve mission planning and execution of CSAR/PR operations. <br />i. Medical Equipment. Medical oxygen systems, patient monitoring systems (pulse oximetry, patient movement support systems), GAMGOW bags, patient warming systems designed and individual performance enhancing systems (high altitude oxygen and related systems) required by GA to provide medical treatment to injured isolated personnel and to operate safely during humanitarian and CSAR missions worldwide. <br />4. Manpower/Personnel. Fielding of Precision Aerial Insertion Systems, Technical Rescue Equipment, Maritime Rescue Equipment, CSAR Sonar, Carbine, and Dive Recovery Technician will require initial training and creation of a training program for GA operators, existing AFE personnel, vehicle maintenance, and maritime equipment contractors assigned to or who directly support maintenance and sustainment of GA equipment at the unit level.<br />5. Maintenance: Maintenance will be provided through either contract logistics support or ACC maintenance personnel. Each item/subcomponent will have an appropriate logistics concept supporting the capability. The contractor will repair anything between the user and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The operator will perform routine and minor repair maintenance (i.e., cleaning, replacement of spare parts, etc.). <br />6. Training. The CLS contractor will provide training as requested by each unit. <br />7. Support Equipment (SE). If additional SE is required, maximum use will be made of current USAF support equipment in the inventory. <br />8. Supply Support. The Contractor will maintain GA spares to support integration and test, and procure initial spares to support initial operations. The use of standardized GA equipment across ACC users will reduce the number of spares necessary to support GA versus managing depot repairs separately.<br />9. Technical Orders. Technical Orders (TOs) will be updated as required. Commercial manuals will be used when feasible.<br />10. Facilities. Facilities or support infrastructure will be required to operate and maintain the GA family of systems. Existing facilities will be used to the fullest extent possible when locating additional equipment and repair facilities. <br />11. Warranty. The Contractor will track and maintain all warranty items and process them for warranty repair. <br />12. Consumables/expendable items. These items will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate directive. Components that have a warranty will be returned to the Contractor for repair/replacement.<br />13. All non-consumables components. Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) is assigned per the Mission Assignment for Battlefield Airman Modernization (BA Mod) Program Letter, dated 12 July 2006 or contractor logistics support (CLS). The level of maintenance will be determined after a cost analysis has been conducted. <br />14. Unique Identification (UID) Requirements. Unique Identification (UID) will be applied in accordance with MIL-STD-130. <br />15. Two (2) paper copies should be submitted as set forth in paragraph 16 below. All paper copies must be clearly labeled "Proprietary/Competition Sensitive Information" on the cover sheets and, in close proximity to this type of information, on each applicable page. Proprietary/Competition sensitive information will be protected from disclosure. E-mail copies of the paper submittal will be accepted.</p>
<p>16. Responses must be received no later than 25 February 2009.

	FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, AJA-47, FAA Headquarters 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues this market survey seeking industry sources to acquire approximately 100 Low Power/High Power Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) systems.  The FAA expects to release a Screening Information Request (SIR) during the 3rd quarter of FY2009 that will require a product operational capabilities test as part of the selection process.  Contract award is expected before the end of CY 2009.
The new procurement is needed to satisfy new/unfilled national airspace systems (NAS) requirements.  The purpose of this market survey is to gain awareness of industry capabilities and determine what commercial products already exist that meet or exceed DME requirements contained in the attached Performance Specification Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) FAA- E-2996.  
There are several new requirements in FAA-E-2996 that include a high power capability, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) requirement for peak power density at the transponder antenna to be at least minus 103 dbW/m2 which was calculated by the government to be equal to minus 94dBm of output power at the input of receiver, and have the capability to adjust the power minus 4dBs in steps of minus 1dB at the output of the transmitter.  No National Airspace System operational requirements have or will be changed and no research and development is envisioned for this procurement.  Informal industry discussions indicate that multiple sources of commercial products may be available that meet or exceed these new requirements.
Interested industry sources must submit responses that demonstrate their DME systems satisfy the requirements of the DME performance specification.  Integrator/Team responses are welcome.  Three copies are requested.  The following technical information is requested: 
1.	Technical data, as appropriate, to demonstrate that available commercial products meet or exceed the DME specification; fifteen (15) page limit.
2.	Vendor corporate history, relevant contract experience that demonstrate ability to produce DME products and demonstrate ability to deploy these DME products in accordance with the attached Statement of Work; Five (5) page limit.
3.	Comments on FAA-E-2996; no page limit.
Responses containing only company brochures, catalogs or other type generic information will be considered unresponsive.  For the above criteria, all experience indicated shall include relevant experience over the last three years, including a brief description of the work performed, the contract number, the identification of the Government or commercial agency for which the work was performed (identify all efforts performed as a subcontractor); and the name, title and telephone number of the Contracting Officer.
For market survey purposes, only, interested industry sources must submit 1) their pricing for products that meet or exceed the DME specification and 2) their company's Business Size Standard and Socio-Economic Status.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334511, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Aeronautical, manufacturing.
All submissions received by the FAA will be treated as Proprietary Information unless otherwise requested by the individual submitter. Inquiries and responses received within thirty (30) days after the publication date of this notice will be considered.  Inquires and responses must be submitted not later than Thursday, March 12, 2009, 12:00, Noon, Eastern Standard Day Light Savings Time (ESDLST).
The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals at this time.  They are not desired and will not be accepted.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The FAA shall not be liable for any costs associated with the preparation of responses to this request for information/market survey, nor reimburse or otherwise pay any costs incurred by any party responding.  Electronic, telephonic and telegraphic responses will not be accepted.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirements to competition based upon response to this is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Respondents will not necessarily be notified of the results of the evaluation.

<DESC>The following is additional information, questions, and clarifications for the Request for Qualifications for Solicitation No. 1443N2000090400 .
The response date is extended from March 5, 2009, to March 12, 2009.  All responses must be received by 4:00 p.m. MST, March 12, 2009 at the following address: 
Via courier- National Park Service; Attn: Rebecca Bizier, 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, Colorado 80228
Via US postal service - National Park Service, Attn: Rebecca Bizier, PO Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225-0287
Questions:  Below are questions received regarding the request for qualifications and appropriate responses.  Please forward additional questions to Rebecca Bizier at Rebecca_Bizier@nps.gov.
Question 1: Under Submittal Requirements, NPS asks for "a completed SF 330 for each firm" and "a Team Standard Form 330".  So assuming we have 4 subcontractors, this would mean we would have to provide individual SF 330s for us and the 4 subs, as well as a team SF 330 for the entire team (i.e., a total of 5 SF 330s).  Please confirm the number of SF 330s you are requesting.
Response 1: Based upon the number of subcontractors you list and yourself as prime, the five SF 330s sounds correct.  Your firm's SF330 would serve as the team one, identifying your firm as the prime and the subcontractors, and then each subcontractor would have an SF 330 as well.
Question 2: Under Technical Evaluation Criteria, specifically criteria #1-3, NPS asks for "a minimum of ten (10) examples of successful projects, including evaluation of their effectiveness to meet each project'sgoals, in national parks or similar natural areas in each of the following NPS regions: Pacific West region, Alaska region, and Intermountain region (including examples of three successful projects in southwestern fluvial systems)."  Our interpretation of this requirement indicates that we must provide 10 projects per NPS region (3 regions) per each of the evaluation criteria #1, #2, and #3, for a total of 90 projects in Section H.  It seems that this would be in addition to our 10 projects listed in Section F of our team SF330 package.  Please confirm the number of requested projects for both Section H and Section F.
Response 2: The minimum of ten examples is for each selection criteria number, so for example criteria one requires a minimum of ten projects, three of which are from the SW area.  We are asking for a minimum of at least 30 projects total for criteria 1-3.  Beyond the requirement for the SW region, it is your choice on where the other projects examples fall in the regions.  The projects listed in section F may be the same listed in response to the criteria or additional projects.
Question 3: Is it acceptable for a firm to put together a response packet for a few select states?  In the solicitation, it mentions "Firm(s)" and that multiple awards may be awarded.  I take this to mean that one could qualify for a section of the project. 
Response 3: The NPS requests that firms or teams of firms meet all of the requirements, including the geographic coverage.  Firms should consider teaming arrangements or demonstrate your firm is capable of obtaining licenses in other states.  
Question 4:  The RFQ lists the NAICS code for this requirement as 541330, size standard $4,500,000.00. Is this a set aside?
Response 4: This is not a set-aside, this request is full and open to all sources.  The size standard will be used to determine if a firm is required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  This plan is not required in this response, but will be requested prior to award if the otherwise successful offeror(s) is a large business(s).  The Government reserves the right to award one or more contracts as a result of this Request for Qualifications.
Question 5:  My firm would like to contact other firms regarding teaming, do you maintain a list of contractors?
Response 5: The FedBizOpps (FBO) website allows contractors to register as interested vendors.  This is the only list the government is aware of, but industry publications may contain other lists.  The government refers all inquiries for teaming to the FBO's interested vendor's list, so it is highly recommended that firms register on the FBO's list.
Question 6: Does the organization chart count towards the maximum 20 double-side pages of additional information?
Response 6:  No, the organization chart will not be counted as part of the additional information.
Clarification: Due to the file size, this request for qualifications was issued in two separate announcements on February 2, and February 3, 2009.  The February 2, announcement discusses the submittal requirements for SF 330s and the February 3, announcement contains the statement of work, required, disciplines, technical evaluation criteria, etc.  PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU REVIEW BOTH PROCUREMENT ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR SOLICITATION NO. 1443N2000090400.

http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/admin_placement/0900117/index.htm
Questions & Answers
1.  Q:  Is the government or contractor responsible for airline, lodging, rental cars, and meals for the students? 
     A:  The government is responsible for all travel-related expenses for the students only.   Travel-related expenses for the contractor should be accounted for in their quote.
2.  Q:  Will the agents be bringing their 9MM service weapons with them? 
     A:  Each Special Agent will bring their issued Glock Model 19 9MM.  5.56 ammunition (1000 rds/student) and 9MM ammunition (175 rds/student) will be provided by the government.
3.  Q:  Will the govt' provide the course curriculum or does the contractor need to develop the curriculum?  If not, we request further description of course programs, qualifications and terms such as "TCO Level II" and "DWE." 
      A:  The Contractor will provide the course curriculum using the objectives and agenda topics established in the RFQ.  "TCO Level II"= Tactical Convoy Operations Level II.  The students have completed a 12 hour Tactical Convoy Operations Level I course providing general guidance on the following (which the government expects to be expanded upon in TCO Level II):  principles of tactical convoys; convoy planning and execution; roles and responsibilities of convoy personnel; individual response drills in vehicles static and dismounted; convoy movement and engagements; communications; and engagement and disengagement.  "DWE"= Distinguished Weapons Expert.
4.  Q:  The SOW mentions two rotations of 15 students but only provides one week of training.  Will the contractor be training 30 students in the week of Feb 23-27?  Or is there a second class of 15 students to be scheduled later? 
     A:  The government expects two days of Tactical Rifle and two days of Tactical Convoy Operations to be conducted concurrently with 15 students in each class, and then switch to the other course.  The final partial day of training brings the entire team of 30 together for scenario-based training.
5.  Q:  The SOW states "Provide instruction to HSD personnel in tactical firing drills including transition from M-4 to 9mm sidearm."  Will the govt' provide the students the 9mm sidearms or does the contractor need to provide them? 
     A:  Each student will bring their government-issued Glock Model 19 9mm.  All 5.56 (1000 rds/student) and 9mm ammunition (175 rds/student) will be provided by the government.
6.  Q:  Will you provide the FLETC Distinguished Weapons Expert Award rifle course of fire as described in the instruction paragraph?
     A:  See attached pdf file.  Please be aware that this is the property of the DHS-FLETC, and is provided For Official Use Only (FOUO).  7.      Q: What Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) do the students use          Respiratory Protection          Air Purifying Respirators (APR) --Millennium, M40/45, MCU-2P, etc.          Powered Air purifying Respirators          Self Contained Breathing Apparatus          Protective Clothing          Permeable          Non-Permeable. 
          A:  For the purposes of this training, the students will conduct only one block of instruction with firearms in PPE shown on the agenda on Tuesday morning ("Firearms Basic and Transition Drills in PPE").  The students will wear a Dupont Tychem SL suit, latex booties, inner and outer nitrile gloves, and MSA Ultra Elite twin-cartridge respirator.  The purpose of this block is to introduce further the constraints of PPE and particularly the twin-cartridge APR on firing a rifle.
     Additionally, we plan to introduce the students to the Saratoga Hammer suits at some appropriate point during the TCO Level II training.  We recognize the limitations of the Saranex suits and are looking for alternatives for tactical missions in contaminated zones. 
8.       Q:  Will the client (students) bring their own PPE? 
          A:  Yes
9.       Q:  Does this effort include training for the use of this PPE? 
          A:  No
10.     Q:  Does this effort include decontamination training? 
          A:  Only from the perspective of planning for decon equipment in vehicle load     plans.
11.     Q:  Does this effort include Detection and Monitoring (D&M) for Hazardous Materials (CBRN TIC/TIM)? 
          A:  Day two of the TCO Level II training and Friday morning will include  scenario-driven practical applications wherein D&M may be used by principals being convoyed to evidence collection locations.  All D&M will be provided by the government.
12.     Q:  If this does include D&M, are there any specific HAZMAT that the contractor should focus on during the training (i.e.: Radiation, Specific Chemicals, Bio agents, etc.)?         A:  Though the practical applications will include CBR-driven scenarios, the focus should be on team convoy operations  
13.    Q:   Does training include Incident Management aspects of operations in a hazardous environment?
         A:  No 
14.    Q:  Will exceptions to exposure, such as radiation, apply to the mission the students expect to operate in? 
         A:  Need clarification in order to provide an answer
15.    Q:  Will the EPA/DHS provide current TTPs and execution templates for convoy operations?
          A:  The Contractor will provide the course curriculum using the objectives and agenda topics established in the RFQ.  "TCO Level II"= Tactical Convoy Operations Level II.  The students have completed a 12 hour Tactical Convoy Operations Level I course providing general guidance on the following (which the government expects to be expanded upon in TCO Level II):  principles of tactical convoys; convoy planning and execution; roles and responsibilities of convoy personnel; individual response drills in vehicles static and dismounted; convoy movement and engagements; communications; and engagement and disengagement.  "DWE"= Distinguished Weapons Expert 
16.    Q:  Will EPA/DHS require the employment of tractor trailer type trucks for the convoy scenarios?
         A:  No-we will be utilizing government-rented SUVs for the convoy operations.
17.    Q:  What Government Furnished Equipment will the EPA provide?
         A:  Issued Glock Model 19 9mm; ballistic vest; tactical drop-leg holster; knee pads; PPE including respiratory protection; detection & monitoring instrumentation; "Red" guns: M-4, Remington 870 and Glock Model 19 9mm; 1000 rds/student 5.56mm and 175 rds/student 9mm; pistol gun-cleaning kits; truck jack; medical trauma/first aid kit; evidence collection kits for scenario-driven training for TCO.
Additionally, we plan to bring various tactical vests, Saratoga Hammer suits, rigger's belts, Molle-type pouches, shooting gloves, etc. for the HSD staff to evaluate.
18.    Q:  Will students lodge at the Contractor's facility?
         A:  Government perdiem is expected to be paid for each student's lodging.  
19.    Q:  Are meals to be provided by the training center?
         A:  Government per diem is expected to be paid for each student.  
20.    Q:  In the SOW, it is stated that agents use the Glock 19 and later it is referred that        agents use M-4 and Beretta pistol; what weapon will need to be utilized for this effort?
         A:  The students will carry their issue Glock Model 19 9mm pistol.  The government expects to rent up to 15 M-4 carbine rifles for four days.
21.    Q:  Will the Government or Contractor provide holsters, gun belts, weapon slings, etc.?
         A:  See answer to question #17.  M-4 slings are not a requirement of this contract.
22.    Q:  What ammunition requirements (5.56mm and 9mm) numbers? 
         A:  See answer to question #17. 
23.    Q:  Is the ammunition count left up the discretion of the service provider?
         A:  See answer to question #17.  Ammo count should correspond to the amount provided by the government.  
24.    Q:  The SOW indicated 15 students (5-day period of instruction) with two course running concurrently.  Can this be clarified.  It seems this requirement, based on the rental of only 15 weapon systems, requires two separate iterations of 5-days.  Please clarify.
         A:  The government expects two days of Tactical Rifle and two days of Tactical Convoy Operations to be conducted concurrently with 15 students in each class, and then switch to the other course.  The final partial day of training brings the entire team of 30 together for scenario-based training.
25.    Q:  Is ammunition provided by Government or Contractor?
         A:  See answer to question #17 and #23.  
26.    Q:  Does the EPA want a full PPE course taught or just a basic familiarization?
          	A:  The students are very familiar with the proper use of issue ppe and do not require further instruction in this area.  Day two of the Rifle Marksmanship course includes a block of instruction on the range where the students will be in Level C ppe with APR and will practice transitioning between the M-4 and the duty sidearm.

Firms may include supporting information in the proposal, such as letters of commendation from clients, on past performance on recent similar contracts. Include information on problems encountered in prior contracts and discuss actions taken to remedy unsatisfactory performance. Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry regarding quality, cost control, and timeliness of work will be reviewed. Past DOD performance data available to the Government through the A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) will also be evaluated. THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS TIEBREAKERS, IF NECESSARY: e. VOLUME OF PAST DOD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Work previously awarded to the firm by DOD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified firms. F. GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Firms based in or having branch offices in Florida with lower mobilization and demobilization costs will be given preference, provided there is an adequate number of qualified firms for consideration. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit one copy of SF 330, Part I, for the proposed combined team (firm or joint venture and all subcontractors), and one separate copy of SF 330, Part II, for the firm or joint venture and each subcontractor. Submittal packages must be received in this office at the address indicated below, no later than 4:00 P.M. Eastern Time on 24 February 2009. Submittals received after this date and time will not be considered. Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective response to this announcement are not desired. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the CCR before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. (The CCR's web site may be accessed at http://www.ccr.gov.) Small and small disadvantaged business firms are encouraged to participate as prime contractors or as members of joint ventures with other small businesses. All interested firms are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and small disadvantaged firms in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Of those dollars the large business firm intends to subcontract out, the Corps of Engineers floors for subcontracting are 70.0% to Small Business concerns; 6.2% to Small Disadvantaged Business concerns; 7.0% to Women-Owned Small Business concerns; 9.8% for HUBZONE concerns; 0.9% to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; and 3.0% to Veteran-Owned Small Business. The term floors is used instead of goals as the Corps of Engineers objective is to exceed the percentages rather than merely meet the percentages. Large firms should keep these floors in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure that each proposed subcontractor's socio-economic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. The NAICS code is 541330. The size standard is $4,500,000. Responses to this ad should be in writing only; telephone calls and personal visits are discouraged. The required forms shall be submitted to the following address: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-TA, 701 San Marco Boulevard, Jacksonville, FL 32207-8175, or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESAJ-EN-TA, P.O. Box 4970, Jacksonville, FL 32232-0019. NOTE: If the offeror intends to hand deliver the offer, access to this building is controlled by security personnel. Visitors requiring access must present a drivers license, current passport, or similar positive identification. Facsimile copies are not acceptable. Security personnel are neither Government employees nor Government contractor employees. For purposes of determining whether an offer is late, delivery into the hands of security personnel will not constitute delivery to the Government. In order to ensure delivery to the Government, persons hand-delivering offers should call the contract specialist whose name appears in the procurement and ask the specialist to send someone to the security desk to take possession of the offer. This is not a request for proposal. The Director of Defense Procurement has issued a final rule requiring that contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before receiving a contract from any activity of the Department of Defense. The rule authorizes contracting officers to reject offers from contractors that have not registered. Call 1-888-227-2423 for more information or visit the CCRs website at http://www.ccr.gov. You must be registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in order to receive an award from this solicitation. The ORCA website is located at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>AMENDED SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS<BR><BR>SUBJECT:  Sole Source Procurement Notification for L-30 North Seepage Management Pilot Project <BR><BR>SOLICITATION NUMBER:  W912EP-09-Z-0003<BR><BR>RESPONSE DATE:  26 FEB 2009<BR><BR>CONTRACT SPECIALIST NAME AND PHONE NUMBER:  CLAURICE M. DINGLE, (904) 232-3736<BR><BR>THIS SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. DO NOT REGISTER FOR PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME. <BR><BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to solicit on a Sole Source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, the Central Control System Components including: security cameras and alarm panel {Mobotix IP cameras and Ademeco alarm provide constant monitoring of pumps and control building security against unauthorized access), web-browser based remote telemetry unit (RTU) {Semaphore's T-BOX modular RTU system is an IP-based telemetry product that completely integrates SCADA, control, and communications functionality into a single package}, RTU enclosure and components, monitoring well water level sensors (InSitu) and groundwater data loggers (Campbell Scientific), and installation oversight of instrumentation (monitoring well groundwater specialized flow meters capable of measuring groundwater velocity and direction) for the L-30 Seepage Management Pilot Project.   The anticipated dollar amount of the Sole Source Components is $350K.<BR><BR>The components listed above have been specifically selected due to their performance interoperability as a part of the central control system.  Substitution of similar components would be considered a financial risk to the government as the components may not function as reliably or effectively as the standardized components which have been specifically selected for their capabilities, thoroughly tested, and have proven themselves in years of service.<BR><BR>The purpose of the L-31 North (L-30) Seepage Management Pilot Project (SMPP) is to identify, test, and determine the relative effectiveness of seepage management technologies in order to recommend features to control groundwater flow and levee seepage from Everglades National Park. Work will include the installation and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with an injection/extraction well system, located near the barrier, adjacent to a sheet pile window.  The barrier will have dimensions of approximately 60-80 feet in depth and approximately 1,000 feet in length. The magnitude of construction is $5-10M. The work is in Miami-Dade County, Florida. THERE IS A DRAFT SOLICITATION AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW ON OUR WEBSITE.   A solicitation will be issued on or about 27 April 2009 with proposals due on or about 11 June 2009.<BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability and respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen calendars days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <BR><BR>Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Claurice Dingle at 904-232-3736 or email at claurice.m.dingle@usace.army.mil.  <BR>

--

                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS


1.) Has there been an initial decision in he matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
a wage
   determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries
of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour Regional Office
for the area in
which the survey was conducted because those Regional Offices
have
responsibility for the Davis-Bacon survey program. If the
response from this
initial contact is not satisfactory, then the process described
in 2.) and
3.) should be followed. 

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process
described here, initial contact should be with the Branch of
Construction
Wage Determinations.  Write to: 

	Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
	Wage and Hour Division
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party
(those affected by the action) can request review and
reconsideration from
the Wage and Hour Administrator (See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR
Part 7).
Write to: 

	Wage and Hour Administrator
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested
party's position and by any information (wage payment data,
project
description, area practice material, etc.) that the requestor
considers
relevant to the issue. 

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested
party may appeal directly to  the Administrative Review Board
(formerly the
Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

	Administrative Review Board
	U.S. Department of Labor
	200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
	Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.



                   END OF GENERAL DECISION
