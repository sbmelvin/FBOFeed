<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to MWH Americas, Inc. a requirement for updating and modifying a government economic model.  The model is a Positive Mathematical Programming agricultural production model written in GAMS. Reclamation has identified MWH Americas, Inc. as both economically and technically capable of performing the required services, based on their knowledge of the government's model, both structure and code, from past performances.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).  The Government believes that only one responsible source can economically and technically provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements, and a Sole Source Determination has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide a similar service must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (303) 445-6345, Attention: John Collins.  Responses should include the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for NAICS Code 541511 which is $21Million.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<DESC>Notice of Intent:  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award to Ameridia [a division of Eurodia Industrie] a requirement for monovalent anion and cation selective ion exchange membranes for use in membrane water treatment system. Reclamation has identified Ameridia as the only source and technically capable of providing the required membranes.  The supplies required are highly specialized membranes that preferentially select monovalent anions or cations (depending on membrane type).  This type membrane is required to reduce the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of brachish water.  To accomplish the reduction, sodium must preferentially be removed while keeping calcium and magnesium in the water.  The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies that will satisfy the agency's requirements.   This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), and a Sole Source Determination has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide a similar required product must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 5 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) requires technical expertise in designing and developing an online course for special education paraprofessionals (1) to develop minimum competencies in working with special education students and (2) to enhance their collaboration skills as they work with educators, other service providers, and parents.  

In addition, The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) requires technical expertise in designing and developing an online course for special education teachers (1) to develop a broader understanding of the characteristics of students with special needs and (2) to expand their repertoire of instructional strategies as they work to teach students with disabilities. 

DoDEA is seeking to implement a comprehensive, holistic, research-based/best practices training program that is consistent not only with the mandates of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the Individuals with Disabilities Act of 2004 (IDEA), but also with the recommendations from nationally-known trainers of paraprofessionals.
