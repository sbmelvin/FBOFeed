<DESC>OPTICAL ARBITRARY WAVEFORM GENERATION (OPTICAL AWG), SOL BAA05-11, Due: 02/15/05, TECHNICAL POCs: DR. JOHN R. LOWELL, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4685 and DR. JAGDEEP SHAH, DARPA/MTO, Ph: (703) 696-2253; Email: baa05-11@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso.; 
Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0511/. The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) and the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) are soliciting innovative research proposals to advance science and technology of optical arbitrary waveform generation and its applications.  The ultimate vision for the Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) is to demonstrate a compact, robust, practical, stable octave-spanning optical oscillator, and to demonstrate the ability to independently encode/decode (both via amplitude and phase modulation) all individual frequency components of such an octave-spanning oscillator with an update rate approaching the mode-locked repetition rate.  This would provide an unprecedented level of performance for optical systems, and enable numerous high level applications, including sub-diffraction-limited imaging and ultra-wideband optical communications.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION. Modern-day pulsed radiofrequency and microwave transmitters exploit large fractional bandwidths (defined as the ratio of the bandwidth of the system to its carrier frequency, which approaches unity in RF systems) to enable a tremendous variety of pulse formats for efficient encoding of information.  This bandwidth is used at the system level to improve channel capacity and isolation, signal reception, or decrease noise sensitivity, for example.  A further demonstration of the ease with which waveform manipulation is accomplished has been the development of commercial RF arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs) with fractional bandwidths greater than 50% at 2 GHz.  However, fractional bandwidth that is exploited in current systems decreases with increasing carrier frequency until it is approximately 10-3 in systems utilizing the 1.5 micron communications band.  Despite being an example of the state of the art, optical communications systems have extremely limited fractional bandwidths when compared to, for example, wireless communications standards such as 802.11b.  The ultimate bandwidth limitations occur in optical systems due to such factors as frequency stability of the laser oscillator; selection of information coding scheme; passive optical element performance; modulator and detector efficiency, speed, and bandwidth; and nonlinear effects due to the transmission medium.  Radical new approaches are required to bring useable fractional bandwidth in optical systems close to unity. Recent advances in ultra-fast optics provide a roadmap for improving the fractional bandwidth of optical systems by orders of magnitude.  The core technology components of the envisioned system are a mode-locked and frequency-stabilized, octave-spanning optical frequency comb functioning as a stable local oscillator; an encoder (or pulse shaper) that would modulate multiple frequency components; and a decoder / receiver capable of extracting the encoded information.  PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. To make the above vision a reality, the Optical AWG Program has two specific objectives that define our areas of interest: 1) to demonstrate technology for producing (and detecting) arbitrary optical waveforms with fractional bandwidths approaching 10%; and 2) to demonstrate system applications of Optical AWGs that are of high military interest, including (but not limited to) those that take inspiration from systems utilizing complex RF waveforms as a means of improving system performance.  It is expected that this research will be conducted in three phases (specified below), with definitive near-, mid- and far-term milestones proposed over a several years period in order to provide measurable metrics for monitoring success toward overall program goals.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged (but are not required) to discuss their ideas with the technical points of contact prior to submitting a proposal. The following sections provide background information about the research topic as well as detailed instructions for submitting proposals to the Optical AWG program. AREAS OF INTEREST . This announcement is a call for proposals describing research to demonstrate three core technology components of an optical arbitrary waveform generation and detection system.  Additionally, we request proposals to demonstrate a specific system application, chosen by the proposer, of an Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generator that is of high military interest.  For more information, see the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), available for download available at: http://www.darpa.mil/dso. PROGRAM SCOPE. The Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation program will consist of an 18 month (Phase I) effort. This will be followed by two subsequent 24 month efforts (Phases II and III).  Clearly stated, quantitative milestones are required 11 and 22 months into each of these phases. Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II or Phase III should include them as an option in their proposal as appropriate. We realize that this is a challenging and high-risk program. In order to mitigate risk, multiple awards are anticipated. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.
PROPOSAL INFORMATION. Specific guidance for full proposal format and content will be contained in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) available at: http://www.darpa.mil/dso. Full proposals will consist of two volumes, Technical and Cost.  Details about format and content of these volumes are contained in the Proposer Information Pamphlet.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged (but are not required) to discuss their ideas with the technical points of contact in advance of submitting a full proposal. The number of awards will be dependent on the suitability of proposals received and availability of funds. Early submission of proposals is encouraged.  PROPOSALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 1600 EST, Tuesday, February 15, 2005.  Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA will not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make awards without discussions. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government’s needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU/MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation. Proposal Evaluation. Evaluation of each proposal will be accomplished through a technical review using the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 1. Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal.  2. Value to defense.  3. Capability of the personnel and facilities to perform the proposed effort.  4. Cost realism. GENERAL INFORMATION: Offerors must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA05-11, Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation, Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on Optical Arbitrary Waveform Generation, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, the DARPA DSO website: http://www.darpa.mil/dso, or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-11 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. Proposals not adhering to format guidelines in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. Address for Submission of Full Proposals and Administrative contact: DARPA/DSO, ATTN: BAA05-11, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714.

Guidance for Classified Information and Data: The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under a BAA will be unclassified. In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal, the following information is applicable. Security Classification guidance on DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing the incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award. Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in applying to this BAA. An applicable classification guide should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.

The Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office’s (AFSEO) currently has Computerize Physical Fit (CPF) models that interface with “GEMACS” (General Electromagnetic Model for the Analysis of Complex Systems), the AFSEO’s primary code for Computational Electromagnetics (CEM), via facet files generated by the AFSEO in the CPF process.  The faceted files are visualized and communicated to GEMACS through the proprietary code “CEM Framework”, a computational electromagnetic software environment developed through a Small Business Innovation Research effort.  To realize the increased modeling and simulation potential afforded by CPF models, this effort will require making modifications and upgrades to GEMACS in two areas: 1) overcoming the “internal resonance” problem that occurs for the electrically large geometries now made possible by the CPF-GEMACS integration, and; 2) efficient and timely solution of large matrix problems generated by the GEMACS physics.  This effort is planned to begin approximately 3 Jan 2005.  We contemplate a one-year basic with four option years.  The NAICS code for the proposed effort is 541511 with an annual income of $21M.  Contractual questions should be directed to Ms. Jewel Burgess, AAC/PKZ, 205 West D Avenue, Suite 468, Eglin AFB, FL 3254, (850) 882-0171 or Ouida Winters at (850) 882-0166.  Technical questions should be directed to Dr. Michael Johnson at (850) 882-0970.  See numbered note 26*****

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT:  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to award a sole source contract to Microsoft Corporation of Charlotte, NC for Microsoft Premiere Support.  This contract will be fixed price.  Since Microsoft applications are used through-out the Coast Guard, only Microsoft Premier Support can provide direct access to Microsoft software developers and proprietary source codes for current and future support.  Purchasing support from another vendor would not be cost effective.  The Coast Guard requires Microsoft to provide assistance for problems when specific symptoms are encountered while using NT 4.0 and a resolution is required.  Without the referenced support, the entire Coast Guard standard workstation infrastructure would be vulnerable.  Problem resolution support must be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Problem resolution can include the following: a modification to Microsoft’s NT 4.0 software code to address specific critical problems, i.e. break-fix request or security vulnerability; and on-site support if needed.  Support Assistance includes: provide short-term advice, guidance and knowledge transfer for issues reported; and support provided remotely. This is a restricted solicitation.   The period of performance for this acquisition is one year (January 01, 2005 through December 31, 2005).  The proposed contract action is for support services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  All interested parties have up to 2 days from the publication of this notice of intent to request a copy of the Request For Proposal (RFP). All correspondence should be addressed to: Commandant (G-ACS-5/AGS/Room 5222), U. S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW, Washington, DC 20593-0001—NOTE 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a new requirement for a Low Power Anechoic Chamber Target System Design. The target system, which has been affectively called an x-y plotter will be independently controlled and programmable and will move exactly the same in all respects.  The controller must be able to be reactive to a direct analogue(s) signal from a main frame computer or be programmable point to point, loop, or go to any of several preselected positions.  The anechoic chamber is best run with no exposed metal and shall be modified to include a structure of non-metallic material that replaces the aluminum extrusion to provide strength and supporting surfaces allowing the vertical strut to operate as the original actuator.  Stopping and the motions of the slide and horn and the components such as the motors, encoders, brakes and sensors are all critical to the design of this system.  Detailed specifications will be available when RFP is issued.  Delivery shall not be later than December 31, 2005.

The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors - commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for extended mission operations and data analysis (MO&DA) support for the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) Mission. NASA/GSFC intends to extend its contract with The University of California at Berkely (UCB) to add additional MO&DA under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source.  UCB was originally responsible for designing, developing, fabricating, assembling, integrating, testing, and storing the RHESSI Observatory. The RHESSI mission represents over 7 years of study, definition, design, and development effort by UCB.  Because of UCB's intimate involvement in the RHESSI program from inception, UCB is uniquely qualified and the only source with the experience, expertise, scientific and technical knowledge of the program to be able to continue the MO&DA effort in the extended mission phase within the current mission schedule. The RHESSI apacecraft and ground segment represents the original research, thoughts, and designs of UCB and their partners.  This cannot be duplicated or readily assumed by a different contractor. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 12/14/04.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for continued Systems Engineering Support to perform independent observer Systems Engineering Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) pre-assessments.  Period of performance is contract award through December 31, 2005. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase this support from Systems Management International, Inc., as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  Systems Management International has provided expert evaluation of NASA's existing technical standards, policies, and procedures on systems engineering since 2000.  This involvement included development of a system engineering framework with which to evaluate the Agency's systems engineering policies and procedures. To bring another contractor on board to serve as the CMMI pre-assessment independent observer would involve substantial start-up costs and time delays in gaining familiarity with the Agency's current systems engineering policy and issues, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for development of a separation method for the enantiomers and isomers of several pyrethroid pesticide compounds and delivery of 100 mg of each compound for which separation is found to be achievable. This procurement is non-commercial, and will be made as a small business set-aside.  The resulting order will support human exposure studies in the area of pesticide method development. Due to the complexity of these molecules, each is present in commercial products in several isomer and enantiomer  forms. In order to correctly quantitate the isomers, it is necessary to have a reference standard of known concentration or composition. Currently, these standards and information are not known to be available. Single enantiomer standards are crucial for method development activities to determine  the elution order from chromatographic columns. The information regarding enantiomer elution order is also imperative for calculating enantiomer fractions, comparing data to that of other researchers, and comparing separations between columns and conditions.  A quality assurance project plan (QAPP)  shall be provided by the contractor for this project within one month of project award. The QAPP must follow "Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans EPA QA/G-5"  found at http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5-final.pdf. Then, the contractor shall begin experiments to develop methods to  separate the enantiomers and isomers of pyrethroid pesticides. Table 1 lists the compound names, number of enantiomers to be separated, and number of isomers to be separated for each compound. Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of each compound with chiral centers marked with an asterisk.  Compounds for separation shall be purchased or synthesized by the contractor. The contractor shall deliver an achievable separation list of containing the names of enantiomers and isomers that will be delivered to the project officer.  Then, the contractor will proceed with the final separation,  purification, and identification of the compounds.  The associated NAICS code is 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences" with a small business size standard of 500 employees or less.  EPA anticipates a firm-fixed price award.  The RFQ will be issued  approximately 12/14/04, and will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. Quotations will be due 40 calendar days after the RFQ is issued.  Offerors will be evaluated based upon  price and technical factors, including past performance, with technical more important than price.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a sole source requirement for the manufacture of a master virus bank of non-replication competent adenoviral vectors containing Ebola gene inserts using a suitable packaging cell line.  This master virus bank will be used in the future production of clinical grade adenoviral vector lots.  The current contract, N01-AO-32757, with Crucell Holland BV, will be modified to add this requirement.  Crucell has been identified as the only responsible source for this procurement for two reasons: 1) all of the remaining MVBs and clinical trial materials for the Ebola vaccine candidate have been manufactured by Crucell using a uniform and approved process.  It is imperative that the identical process is used for manufacture of this MVB in order to ensure product consistency and regulatory approval, and 2) Crucell is currently the only source of a packaging cell line, PER.C6(TM) , which does not produce replication-competent adenovirus (RCA).  Any questions or capability statements should be forwarded to Terrie Nestor, tnestor@niaid.nih.gov, by 2:00pm on January 12, 2005.  See Note 22.

<DESC>I. INTRODUCTION. In the past, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has relied on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to acquire spacecraft and instruments for NOAA’s Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite System (GOES), while NOAA has acquired the ground and data routing systems. NOAA seeks industry input on the concept of an acquisition involving a single prime contractor for an end-to-end fully integrated space and ground system for the future GOES-R program, rather than NOAA awarding multiple contracts for ground and data routing systems and NASA awarding multiple contracts for space and instrument systems. The goal of such an acquisition strategy would be to simplify the Government’s interface with industry by choosing, through competitive means, a single prime contractor responsible for defining, designing, developing, producing, deploying, maintaining, and testing the total end-to-end GOES-R system and sustaining its operations for the life of the system. This single prime contractor would interface with the Government and would manage all program subcontractors for the life of the program. This new contracting approach for GOES-R is only being considered; the Government is investigating other NOAA- or NASA-managed alternatives for the contracting approach.
II. BACKGROUND. The mission of the GOES-R series satellites will be to provide continuous, near real-time meteorological, oceanographic, solar, and space environment data that supports NOAA’s five strategic mission goals; namely, (1) protecting, restoring, and managing the use of coastal and ocean resources through ecosystem-based management; (2) understanding climate variability and change to enhance society's ability to plan and respond; (3) serving society's needs for weather and water information; (4) supporting the Nation's commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally sound transportation; and (5) providing critical support to NOAA’s mission. The GOES-R satellite series is planned for launch in the 2012 timeframe and is the follow-on to the GOES N-P series to meet new requirements validated through a rigorous screening and verification process. It presents an opportunity to explore new instruments, satellite design, and system architectures utilizing improved communication and instrument technologies. GOES-R represents an increase in the number of products (151 vs 43), increased spatial resolutions (0.5 km visible and 4 km IR soundings) and improved refresh rates (5 min vs 24 min for full hemispheric coverage). GOES-R improvements in environmental sensing instruments include an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) with 16 channels, a Hyperspectral Environmental Suite (HES) with approximately 1500 channels capable of providing soundings and imagery to include costal waters, an improved Solar Imaging Suite (SIS); an improved Space Environment In-Situ Suite (SEISS), and a new GOES Lightning Mapper (GLM). NOAA is also investigating other possible operational instruments, such as a hyperspectral imager, solar irradiance sensor, coronagraph, and microwave imager/sounder. 
III. HISTORY. In October 2003, NOAA funded a series of End-to-End architecture studies to determine the optimal GOES-R architecture. These studies defined alternative system architectures that would meet performance requirements ultimately resulting in a Government Reference Architecture (GRA). The GRA is used as the Government’s notional system baseline for cost estimation, budget formulation, and performance assessment relative to user requirements. The Government will introduce the GRA as a reference point, but will expect industry to propose innovative and best-value solutions to best meet the Government’s requirements, not necessarily to build the GRA. The Government does not intend to use the GRA as a factor in any source selection decision. The Government also initiated early instrument designs, risk reduction and trade studies, concentrating on critical instruments. NASA conducted competitive procurements resulting in multiple industry awards. These instrument development activities were started prior to the rest of the system in order to mitigate technical risk, facilitate interface definition, and enable refinement of NOAA performance requirements. 
IV. PROPOSED APPROACH. The Government anticipates two future acquisition phases; namely, a Program Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase with multiple contracts awarded and a subsequent down-select to an Acquisition and Operations (A&O) phase with one contract awarded. During the PDRR phase, each contractor will simultaneously and separately optimize system architectures (balancing performance and cost), prepare to assume responsibility for completion of instrument development programs, and demonstrate ability to meet end-to-end system performance requirements through reviews with Government program managers. In the A&O phase, the single prime contractor will be responsible for all aspects of design, development, integration, acceptance and testing, deployment, and operations of the total system, including space, ground, and launch segments. The Government will require that the contractor assume responsibility under its prime contract for instruments currently being developed, as the Government will likely close out those instrument contracts and the contractor will assume responsibility for completion of these efforts. For PDRR, the solicitation (RFP) might be issued in March 2005 with contract awards in September 2005; for the A&O phase, the down-select RFP might be issued in time to support a June 2007 contract award. 
V. THE GOVERNMENT’S NEED. NOAA solicits input from industry on a single prime contractor approach for the GOES-R system acquisition. Any party interested in assisting the Government as it makes its decision on this acquisition strategy is invited to prepare and submit a white paper with its thoughts, observations, cautions, or recommendations. A white paper must be brief, should not exceed four pages in Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format, should be written from the perspective of helping Government program managers make a decision, and should be delivered to John Inman at john.inman<at>noaa.gov by 5PM on Wednesday, December 8, 2004. NOAA intends to hold an industry day to announce the GOES-R acquisition strategy on Monday, December 13, 2004, at 1:00PM EST in the NOAA auditorium in Silver Spring, Maryland. Interested parties should email Mary M. Petruzzo (mary.petruzzo@noaa.gov) not later than December 6, 2004, with their intent to attend and the names of individuals attending. The agenda and map to the NOAA auditorium will be posted on the NOAA GOES-R webpage at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov.

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Detroit Arsenal, Michigan.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offers will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Detroit Arsenal
Location: U.S. Army Tank-Automotive & Armament Command (TACOM) located adjacent to the community of Warren, Michigan, approximately 20 miles northeast of Detroit.  

Installation Description:  The Arsenal is a compact military community consisting of approximately 20 buildings situated on about 300 acres and is also host to the Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center which provides support to various research, development and testing activities ensuring acceptable equipment and technologies for U. S. Army personnel.   

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.   Electrical Distribution System Description
The current electrical distribution system to be privatized consists of approximately 4.14 miles of underground lines, 44 pad mounted transformers, 32 sectionalizing switches, 1,436 manholes, 16 services and streetlights which consist of 80 fixtures, 45 utility poles, and 0.81 miles of lighting circuits.

B. Water Distribution System: 

The current water distribution system to be privatized includes both potable water and a fire protection system.  The water distribution system consists of 1.48 miles of various water main piping ranging in size from 4 to 10 inches.  The fire protection system consists of 2.28 miles of water main piping ranging in size from 4 to 10 inches.  Water is furnished/supplied to the Arsenal by the City of Warren. 

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water systems.

C.  Wastewater Collection system:

The system may include, but is not limited to treatment facilities, collection piping and appurtenances.  

The current wastewater distribution system to be privatized includes 1.77 miles of sewer mains.  There are no wastewater treatment facilities.  All wastewater is conveyed to the City of Warren for treatment and disposal.  
According to California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region, Standard Provisions and Reporting Requirements for Waste Discharge Requirements, January 1984, C. General Reporting Requirements, “Transfer of control or ownership of a waste discharge facility must be preceded by a notice to the Regional Board at least 30 days in advance of the proposed transfer date.  The notice must include a written agreement between the existing discharger and proposed discharger containing specific date for transfer of responsibility, coverage, and liability between them.  Whether an order may be transferred without modification and a public hearing is at the discretion of the Board.  If order modification is necessary, transfer may be delayed 120 days after the Regional Boards receipt of a complete Report of Waste Discharge.”

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on-line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation number N00178-05-R-1016.  Provided are questions received with the Government's answers.  Question: The bid is for both a MWIR and NIR camera. Can a vendor reply to one of the two or does the vendor have to supply a complete two camera order?   Answer: In answer to your questions, the combined/solicitation is amended to allow for offerors to bid on one or both cameras.  Award will be made to the offeror(s) which is/are most advantage to the Governme! nt for either one or both cameras. Question:  How specifically is the technical weighting applied?  Answer: Each weighted specification will be analyzed using the following method.  The percent difference will be calculated for the specification of interest.  This percent difference will be multiplied by the weighting factor.  The results for each item will be averaged and the camera with the greatest value will be selected.  MWIR Specification Questions:  Question:  Spectral Response: Is the specified value (3.0-5.5µm) nominal or the required waveband?  ANSWER: This is a nominal operating waveband.  QUESTION: Form Factor: Is the form factor defined by the final configuration that this system will be integrated into or for other factors? This form factor is going to be challenging.  ANSWER: After further review, the requirement of "Form Factor:  less than or equal to 20cm x 8 cm x 8 cm Small form factors will more easily fit into the current system design and will be conside! red as a justification for increased cost" requirement is deleted from the System Performance Specifications.  MWIR Specification Omissions:  QUESTION: There is no mention of the requirement for the system to be cooled by a closed cycle Sterling cooler or Liquid Nitrogen. Is an LN2 solution acceptable? We would assume not.  ANSWER: Closed cycle Sterling cooler is required. A LN2 solution is not acceptable.  QUESTION: There are no salient performance specifications on NEDT or operability. Are these not applicable?  ANSWER: NEDT: < 25 mK, f/1  QUESTION: There is no mention of any data collection system (specifications), Software Developers Toolkits, or any other requirements from the vendor to provide technical information or software/hardware in response.  ANSWER: Hardware: Camera will be connected to an IOIndustries CL-160 frame grabber.  Camera shall be delivered with the appropriate cabling/hardware to connect to this frame grabber.  Software: Digital data from the camera ! will be acquired using IOIndustries Streams 5 s/w running on an NSWCDD owned system, therefore the vendor is not responsible for supplying data collection s/w or hardware.  Vendor is responsible for supplying camera control software. QUESTION: There is no specification for lenses. What are the requirements? (Or should we assume that this tracking mount will have an integral telescope. If so, what are the specifications, i.e. focal length, f number, etc.)    If the customer is to use their own telescope, will there be a requirement for a custom aperture on the camera, i.e. f4.0 or f8.0?  If the customer provides their own telescope, will all the vendor be absolved of above mentioned performance attributes, i.e. NEDT, bad pixel correction, non-uniformity because of potential aperture mismatch?  Answer: Vendor is not responsible for supplying a lens. A custom telescope will be purchased and will be matched to the camera aperture.  Initial telescope design is an f/4, 2 meter foc! al length.

<DESC>The original posting for this procurement notified the public that the requirement would be solicited as a total small business set-aside.  This would require the inclusion of FAR Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting," which requires the successful small business offeror to complete at least 50% of the work themself.  After speaking with several interested small businesses, it does not appear likely that a small business would be capable of fulfilling the limitation on subcontracting requirement.  Therefore, this procurement will now be solicited under full and open competition procedures.

<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms with a bona fide Washington State office only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $60 Million.  Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.    
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.  
     Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible 8(a) firms located in Washington State and 8(a) participants in good standing serviced by a SBA office outside of Washington State but having a Bona fide branch office in Washington State.  A Bona fide branch office is a place of business for purposes of 8(a) construction procurements located where an 8(a) Participant regularly maintains an office which employs at least one full-time individual within the appropriate geographical boundary.  The term does not include construction trailers or other temporary construction sites.       
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.  The only plan-holder list available is via the ESOL website under this solicitation number.  Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on or about January 11, 2005.  The estimated period of proposal preparation will be at least 30 days.  The e-mail address for inquiries is: mark.snell@navy.mil.

<CONTACT>Sharon Teger Business Specialist 7037871263     sharon.teger@mms.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Minerals Management Service (MMS).  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential small business sources that are interested in and capable of performing the work described below.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement would be 541710 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (less than 500 employees)."  MMS does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the evaluation of the information received.  Based on the review of the responses to this RFI, the MMS may issue a small business set aside or full and open competitive requirement for Capability Statements and subsequently a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against MMS shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the MMS use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirements.  MMS will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this RFI.  NOTE: At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business concern.  SCOPE OF WORK: Specific study tasks will include the development and conduct of a biological field data collection/computer numerical wave modeling program within potential sand borrow sites located in federal waters offshore the west coast of Florida to address the following issues: Characterization and evaluation of benthic habitats, biological communities (infauna, epifauna, demersal, and pelagic fishes), and sediment grain size in potential borrow areas. Biological field data collected will be used in conjunction with existing literature to the maximum extent possible; Assessment of the potential effects of offshore sand dredging on benthic and pelagic communities, including an analysis of the potential rate and success of recolonization following cessation of dredging; Using the procedures and conclusions set out in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Special Report 262: A Process for Setting, Managing, and Monitoring Environmental Windows for Dredging Projects (http://trb.org//publications/sr/sr262.pdf) as a guide, development of a time schedule of environmental windows that best protects benthic and pelagic species from adverse environmental effects; Examination of the potential for alteration in the local wave field following dredging and the excavation of sand from within potential sand borrow sites offshore the west coast of Florida; Examination of the potential for increased wave action after dredging within potential sand borrow sites and any resultant adverse localized changes in erosional patterns and longshore coastal transport which could result in significant losses of beach sand after renourishment; Examination of the potential for changes in local sediment transport rates as a result of altering the local bathymetry, particularly in light of the recent studies which indicate that bathymetry does influence the manner in which waves approach the shoreline during storm events; Examination of the cumulative physical effects of multiple dredging events and extraction of a large volume of material within the identified potential borrow sites; Examination, on a generic basis using numerical wave modeling, the potential for adverse effects on the physical wave field from dredging along the west Florida shelf, taking into account the differences in topography between this area and the Atlantic offshore area.  The total performance period of this study is estimated at thirty-two months.  SOURCES SOUGHT: Interested organizations should submit a capability statement of approximately 20 pages that details the small business firm's ability to perform all aspects of the effort described above.  Emphasis should be placed on prior experience conducting technical/scientific projects of similar scope and complexity and publication record in peer reviewed scientific journals.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.  Responses will be reviewed by MMS personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.  RESPONSES ARE DUE no later than 3:00 pm Eastern Time on December 20, 2004.  Please submit three (3) copies of your response to the attention of: Sharon Teger, Contracting Officer, Procurement Operations Branch, Minerals Management Service, and if using regular U.S. mail - MS 2100, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170; or if hand delivered or using a courier service - 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.

<DESC>The US Air Force Air Warfare Battlelab is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to Digital Video Recording.  The system should allow digital video recording on three aircraft—MC-130E, MC-130H, MC-130P—and subsequent playback of the recordings on a standard desktop monitor.  The recorder must record and play back the displayed images aircrew members see when flying the aircraft.  Recordings will be made of the images presented on the aircraft displays.  There will be up to four different displays recorded (combination of mapping radar, terrain-following radar, and Forward Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) displays).  The displays are not the same in each type aircraft, but all are presented on digital displays.  The recording will be played back split-screen on a standard computer monitor.  If four different screens are being recorded, all four will be presented on one monitor and the recordings will be synchronized.  Images that occurred at the same time on the aircraft will occur at the same time during playback.  The system should allow simple management of recordings.  The system could possibly use compression to allow storage of numerous recordings on a hard drive or the system could record to a CD.  Whatever method is used must allow users to save mission recordings, make copies to pass to other users, fast-forward through recordings, etc.  Multiple uses of this DVR are envisioned.  Combat mission recordings can be used for post-mission debriefs.  Airfield approach recordings can be used when performing mission planning follow-on missions to the same airfield/LZ.  Airdrop recordings can also be used to plan follow-on missions to the same drop zone.  Recordings of terrain-following training routes can be used to teach basic terrain-following techniques.  Approach and airdrop recordings also have training value.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning mature technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, possibly to be used in a Battlelab concept demonstration.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 17 December 2004.  White papers should not exceed four pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. David Dougherty of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at dougherd@ctc.com or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Dougherty.  You may contact Mr. Dougherty with any questions you may have at (814) 262-6972.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP. The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received. The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

<SUBJECT>20 -- Homopolar Brush Workshop Announcement
<DESC>11/23/2004 Homopolar Brush Workshop Announcement Background: The U.S. Office of Naval Research (Department of the Navy) is sponsoring development of homopolar motors for navy ship propulsion applications. Current collectors (brushes) are a key technology essential to success of this development. ONR is interested in obtaining input from the US science and technology community in the interest of furthering understanding of this essential technology. Announcement: ONR is hosting a workshop for the purpose of identifying new, innovative, and dynamic science and technology approaches in current collection for large superconducting homopolar motors. We are seeking to discover and develop technologies that will lead to current collectors capable of operating at the following full-scale homopolar motor conditions: • Brush Current Density: >188 A/cm^2 • Brush Current: >375 A/brush (DC)Created on 11/8/2004 9:45 AM • Total loss per brush < 30 watts/brush (goal), <60 W/brush (max.) • Slipring coverage: 75% • Brush aspect ratio: 4 to 1 (circumferential to width dimensions at the slipring interface) • Life: 15 years in navy combatant application, implying a dimensionless wear of 3x10^-11 (wear/distance traveled on slipring) • Operation in a minimum magnetic field of .42 Tesla perpendicular to brush/slipring interface surface and .79 Tesla parallel to brush interface surface and perpendicular to the direction of rotation any direction. Goal is operation in fields of 1.4T and .8 T respectively. • Brush sliding speed: 0 to +/-15 m/sec. • Brushes are Non-commutating riding on a slipring interface Liquid metal current collectors are specifically excluded for this forum. Funding opportunities are likely to arise as a result of white papers and proposals submitted in response to the recommendations from this workshop. ONR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA 04-001) will be applicable to this program and is available on the ONR website. This technology is export controlled, thus workshop attendance will be restricted to U.S. citizens only. All information presented and discussed in this workshop will be non-proprietary. Discussion: The Homopolar motor brush workshop is designed to inform the community of the ongoing program and technical issues, and to accept feedback from the community on directions for long term research in brush development. The workshop will begin with the first day including a description of the ONR homopolar motor development program and specifically the brush development efforts, modeling and results to date. The presentations will be followed on the second day by targeted panel sessions that will discuss, develop and recommend the science and technology needs to which the technical community can respond. Each panel will brief their conclusions to the group at large at
the end of the second day. A tentative agenda is given below. The three discussion areas planned for the panel sessions are: I. Macroscopic brush and brush holder issues II.

The proposed contract is 100 percent set aside for small business concerns. This request is solicited as advertise only.  Funds are not presently available for this requirement. The Government's obligation under this requirement is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which contract award can be made. Although it  is possible that award shall be made in December 2004, SITE VISIT TO TAKE PLACE DEC 07, 2003, 1:00 PM AT MESS HALL 410, FORT HARRISON, HELENA, MT 59601 STATEMENT OF WORK Catered Meals, Montana Army National Guard Regional Training Institute 1. SCOPE 	The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, supervision, and supplies, to include any required travel, necessary to provide catered meals to the Montana Army National Guards (MT ARNG) Regional Training Institute (RTI), Mess Hall 410, located at Fo rt Harrison in Helena, Montana. 2. PURPOSE / REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY 2-1.	As stated in paragraph 1, this contract is for catered meals for the MT ARNGs RTI.  These meals will feed two types of soldiers.  The first type is a MT ARNG soldier who is participating in a routine IDT or drill weekend.  The second type is a soldier from Montana (or other state) who is attending the RTI for training, or ADT.   2-2.	All requirements to provide the meals are incidental to the catered meal cost.  The contractor is to provide meals and condiments, to include salt, pepper and sugar, flatware, plates, hot & cold beverage cups/glasses, and napkins. 2-3.	The meals will be served at Fort Harrison in Mess Hall 410.  The Government will allow the contractor limited use of the kitchen, which comprises a storage area in the refrigerator, and access to water and electrical outlets.  Limited use excludes all  equipment used to actually prepare meals. 2-4.	MT ARNG Training Site Headquarters personnel shall provide guidance and instruction on inventory and facility policies and responsibilities.  The Contractor and MT ARNG shall conduct an inventory and walk-through of Mess Hall 410 before and after each  catered meal event.  The Contractor shall be held responsible for the building and equipment, which must be found acceptable prior to each MT ARNG payment for catered meals. 2-5.	Meal counts prior to each month are approximate.  The fiscal year meal count estimates can be downloaded at (http://www.montanaguard.com/USPFO_meal.htm).  The MT ARNG / RTI Project Officer will provide a head count to the contractor after the first me al on the first day of each training period.  The Contractor will adjust accordingly, and verify ADT / IDT meal numbers actually served respectively with the RTI Project Officer after each event.   3.  Menu The Contractor shall serve nutritional meals consistent with favorable offerings served to commercial clientele.  The Montana Army National Guard strictly uses the Armys General 20 Day Menu Information when preparing soldier meals with Army cooks.  We off er it here as a guide and general standard.  Refer to (http://montanaguard.com/USPFO_Home.htm).  The meals served should include similar, but not exact, portions and servings of all food groups, beverages, and condiments indicated in the 20 Day Menu.  Cont ractors are encouraged to replace meals from the 20 Day Menu with nutritional meals theyve tail ored and developed for commercial clientele as long as the integrity of a quality menu/meal is maintained.  For example, a contractors specialty flat bread can be used in place of wheat bread called for in the Army Menu.   4.  PERFORMANCE PERIOD 4-1.	The period of performance shall start on 01 January 2005 and continue each month through September 30, 2005. 5. HOURS OF OPERATION 5-1 The Contractor shall begin serving meals at the start of the following time periods:  Breakfast:  	  7:00 a.m.  8:00 a.m. Lunch:		12:00 p.m.  1:00 p.m. Dinner: 	  5:00 p.m.  6:00 p.m. 6.

Each invoice shall include the CLIN number, type event (ADT or IDT), event date, and number of meals served. 6-2	 The Contractor shall be paid for at least 90% of the meal count estimate each month up to a maximum of the adjusted headcount.  For example, if the headcount estimate prior to a given month for ADT meals was 100, but had to be adjusted by the Project Officer down to 85, and 85 meals were served, the Contractor would be paid for a minimum of 90 meals.  On the other hand, if the headcount had increased to 115, and the Contractor fed 115 meals, the Government would pay the Contractor for 115 meals. 7. ENTRY TO FORT HARRISON 7-1.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. The provision is attached.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>This announcement has been amended to provide the required location for the firing range.  Please see below - 2nd paragraph.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00006, which is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This requirement is a small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

The Department of homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firing range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range must be within a 40 mile radius or one hour travel time from Denver, Colorado.

The proposed ranges must meet various standards to qualify. The range must be available a minimum of six (6) days per month / 18 days per quarter.  The range must have parking available for up to 25 vehicles.  The range must have restroom facilities.  The range may be indoors or outdoors; and possess a minimum field of fire of 270 degrees (to support multiple target engagement and individual/team tactical movement.  The range must possess rheostatically controlled lighting on the targets when they are in the “faced” position.  Outdoor ranges must possess sufficient lighting to promote safe range and live-fire operations during the hours from dusk to dawn.  Indoor ranges must possess rheostatically controlled lighting so that dim-light (dusk and dawn) and dark conditions may be replicated (to support the conduct of training in the use of the weapon’s “night sights” in dim light conditions wherein the target is identifiable but the weapon’s sights are hard to see; and training in the use of flashlights where flashlights are required by the shooter to find and identify their target (s).  The range must possess a minimum of 30 firing points.  The range must possess turning targets (instructor selectable “face” times ranging from .1 second to 99.9 seconds, minimum ) and a dual moving target system running laterally the full width of the target line.  The range must accommodate the use of portable reactive steel target systems of varying designs and sizes.  The range impact berms/bullet traps must be sufficient to absorb the minimum expenditure of 135,000 rounds per quarter.  The range must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 50 yards.  The range must possess a public address system available during firearms training.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 50-, 25-, and 15-yard line course of fire.  The range must possess some type of classroom facility (40 person capacity, minimum) with chalkboard or marker board, overhead projector, and projector screen.  The range must be able to accommodate all handgun calibers and must allow the use of “frangible” ammunition.  The range rules cannot disallow movement between firing points or restrict movement-oriented firearms training firing points by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules cannot disallow students from drawing and firing from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e. tactical shooting-on-the-move, shooting and moving, team movement live fire drills) where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive.  The range rules must allow shooters to utilize weapons on fully automatic fire drills.  The range must possess a storage area dedicated to DHS inspectors/officers use that would allow storage of up to 300,000 rounds ammunition, 6000 cardboard target backers, various types and quantities of paper targets, and realistic quantities of consumable/ expendable supplies and equipment to support live fire range operations.  The range must have proper drainage control as well as a safe usable surface during rainy conditions.  Indoor ranges must possess a ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.  The estimated days of range usage are 18 days per quarter. The estimated number of rounds fired are 135,000 rounds per quarter.

MANDATORY SHIPPING DIRECTIONS

PCO Logistics:

	PCO Logistics is required to track equipment, materials and goods coming into Iraq under the Re-building Iraq effort. This tracking and inherent accountability process will assist in assuring that all equipment materials and goods are able to cross the borders and move to final destination with minimal delay and at reduced risk.   However, in order to accomplish this mission, maximum cooperation is necessary.  Prompt notification and compliance with our information requirements will assist in providing advance notice to the point of entry of all inbound shipments.  This process affords coordination in the movement of all convoys which will enable improved monitoring and de-conflicted convoy schedule.  Prompt notification also improves security coordination through the operations center.
To get started follow the following steps:   

Step One: 
Upon contract award the contractor is required to provide the necessary logistical information needed by PCO Logistics. This information can be provided and updated as necessary by going to the PCO website (http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net) and logging in by selecting “Contractor/Vendor Log In” under the Logistic heading.  Initial log in will require the user to request a user name and password. Once the username and password is provided the user can identify and grant access to the other members or subcontractors.    Should there be any problems with this process contact the Logistics Movement Coordination Center (LMCC) Watch Officer directly at the following e-mail address:  pcolmcc@halliburton.com and the necessary assistance will be provided.  If the interim process is still in place the contractor will find four (4) forms listed and available under the logistics heading (Logistics Information Requirements Form, Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form, Cargo Plaques and Logistical Support Request).  Those forms should be individually completed and, with the exception of the cargo plaque, sent electronically to the above mentioned e-mail address for the LMCC.  The first form submitted will be the Logistics Information Requirements Form. The Logistics Information Requirements Form should be completed upon award of contract and updated as necessary.  All updates and changes to this form should be sent to the same e-mail address as the original form.  Additional contact information is available on the website mentioned above. Always reference the contract number.  

Step Two:
CPA 1-47  CUSTOMS LEVY EXEMPTION AND SHIPMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER PROJECT AND CONTRACTING OFFICE (PCO) 

Effective 15 April 2004 Tariff Regulations pursuant to CPA Orders #54, as amended by Order #70 (Orders #54 and #70 are posted on the website), require commercial importations into Iraq to pay a 5% levy except for food, books, medicine, medical equipment, clothes and oil.   Additional exemptions include NGO’s, International Organizations, Reconstruction Projects under PCO, and single exempt donations.   Items shipped under this contract are exempt from this “Levy” provided a completed Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form is attached and included with each invoice and packing slip.  
 
The contractor is required to fill out the Reconstruction Levy Exemption Form and attach the duty free form to each shipment of goods under this contract that crosses the border into Iraq in order to qualify for the exemption.  The contractor must submit one copy of the completed duty free form and a copy of the first page of the primary contract, for customs verification, to the contracting officer and the PCO Logistics Office at pcocustoms@halliburton.com) 72 hours prior to the planned arrival date at the Iraq point of entry.


Step Three:
The items being acquired are for Iraqi Reconstruction and as per the “Packing and Marking Instructions” of this contract, and shall be Packaged and Marked accordingly.  Additionally, a Cargo Plaque is available from the website at http://www.rebuilding-iraq.net under the logistics tab located at the top of the page.  There is a memorandum posted that explains how to complete the plaques.  There are three plaques, one is for shipments arriving into Baghdad International Airport, one is for shipments arriving into the Port of Umm Qasr, and the third one is for all other shipments.  The use of these plaques will ensure they are properly identified as PCO shipments and will reduce risk of loss or pilferage.  Each shipment must have a cargo plaque affixed to all sides of each container, pallet, or package.
 
Step Four:
If this contract has the shipment bound for a PCO warehouse location and will require PCO Logistics to assist in the shipment from the point of entry into Iraq or material handling equipment support at the warehouse, a Logistical Support Request (LSR) must be completed and submitted 48 hours prior to expected movement of the shipment or its arrival at the point of entry.  The LSR can be found at the above mentioned web site under the logistics tab.

It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide all the requested information mentioned above as well as using the identified cargo plaques in sufficient time to allow for required delivery.  Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a delay of the goods and materials being shipped from arriving at their final destination. Delays resulting from failure to follow the above steps may be assigned as the contractor’s responsibility.
