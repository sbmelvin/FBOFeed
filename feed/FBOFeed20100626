<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI). Responses are due by 2:00 PM CST 8 July 2010.<BR><BR>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  This is not a request or proposal nor will technical capability statements be considered as a proposal.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow-up information requested.  The Government is in need of information on potential sources that can provide products to serve as spare parts in support of fielded RAID, BETSS-C and CERBERUS systems.  The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors who can successfully support this requirement.   The issuance of a solicitation is contingent upon the information gathered from this sources sought notice and other information available to the Government.<BR><BR>Responses must clearly demonstrate the qualifications, capability and expertise of the vendor.  Responses to this notice will be used as part of the market research that will be used to develop the acquisition strategy to satisfy this potential requirement.<BR><BR>The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy, there is no solicitation and there is no other information available at this time.  Only responses to this RFI will be accepted at this time. Questions regarding the scope of work or acquisition strategy will not be accepted.  In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made. <BR><BR>The USASMDC is conducting a Market Survey to identify the availability of commercial Electro optic/Infra Red (EO/IR) sensors and/or cameras that can serve as replacement/spare parts for currently fielded surveillance and target acquisition systems (collectively refer as the systems).  These systems are capable of detecting hostile troop and/or equipment movement at great distances. This capability enables U.S. forces to respond rapidly to threatening situations in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The systems are intended to minimize the vulnerability of U.S. and coalition forces and enable timely and appropriate response options (direct air attack, indirect fire, and ground patrol/attack) against Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), Vehicle-Born IEDs, rocket-propelled grenades, mortar, and small arms attacks.  The systems include a sensor suite that is capable of providing 360 degree, day/night visible and thermal imaging of areas within radio extending from 0 to 20+ kilometers.  The EO/IR sensors that have been employed to date are the FLIR Star SAFIRE III, Star SAFIRE HD, THV-3000, and Ranger III XR+ sensors.  The Government is interested in identifying sources capable of satisfying the requirement for sparing of the sensors utilized in the RAID, BETSS-C, and CERBERUS systems.  More specifically, those having available similar products that could be utilized in place of the aforementioned FLIR sensors.<BR><BR>The systems shall have a sensor suite with Operational Availability (Ao) objective greater than 0.99 when 50% spare sensors are included. The systems require an optical sensor with 360 degree field of coverage capable of detecting and providing geo location data on man size targets (2 meters by 1 meter) out to a range in excess of 10 kilometers. Visible and infrared capabilities are required for day and night time use.  Visible sensor shall include full color and spotter scope capability for zooming in on distant targets of interest and obtaining maximum discriminatory information on those targets.  Visible and infrared sensors shall be bore sighted together such that switching from one sensor to the other will result in looking at the same location.  A laser range finder (or equivalent geo location device) will also be bore sighted to the visible and infrared sensor look angles for accurate computation of the location of the object being viewed. Sensor housing shall be actively stabilized to insure that distant targets, regardless of their relative motion with respect to the sensor, can be viewed for extended periods of time without resulting in excessive strain on the operator viewing the image.  Visible and infrared sensors shall have multiple fields of view to allow for wide angle panning of the area followed by an instantaneous switching to a narrow or super narrow field of regard for rapidly assessing distant targets of interest.  Sensor shall also have a laser illuminator and auto tracking capability.  The laser illuminator shall provide a beam of light visible only through night vision goggles.  That beam of light will originate at the sensor and be bore sighted such that it will terminate at the target of interest as soon as it is activated (i.e. no searching for the target will be required).<BR><BR>The Government is conducting market research to review whether it should / can compete a contemplated sole source contract for spares to support the listed sensors.  The Government seeks future competition. Respondents should make note of how their respective sensor meets or exceeds the performance requirements noted.<BR><BR>Responses by Contractors:<BR><BR>The response shall include capability to provide products to support all three systems.  If a determination is made regarding the issuance of a solicitation such solicitation will be all inclusive.  Responses to this RFI need to provide data sufficient to support ability of the respective sensors to perform within the same criteria as noted within this RFI.  Common questions that need to be addressed in the RFI response are:<BR><BR>1.	Has the respondents sensor been deployed as part of an operational system?  If so please provide Government POC contact information or other POC.  Also state in what quantities the systems are being deployed.<BR>2.	What is the average time the respondents sensor spends in the repair and return cycle?<BR>3.	Can the respondent provide the physical mounting and data/power cabling information, along with a list of the command and control functions and display data?<BR>4.	Does the respondents sensor have advertised maximum EO and IR detection recognition and identification ranges for a man sized target (2 meter by 1 meter) and at those ranges can GEO location data (using the laser range finder) be obtained?<BR>5.	Does the firm have commercial and/or GSA price lists and delivery schedule information for the respective sensors?<BR>6.	Are the sensors being manufactured in the United States? <BR><BR>If you believe your firm qualifies as a potential contractor and has existing qualified personnel, relevant past performance experience, and the technical capability to perform the type of work specified, please submit the following information: <BR><BR>1. Company name, cage code and mailing address.<BR>2. Point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address) <BR>3.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br><br>Solicitation # W91LV2-10-HOUSTON is a Request for Quote (RFQ) for lodging, conference space and services associated with Yellow Ribbon Event for the period 09 - 11 July 2010. This procurement is being issued as a total small business set-aside.  Only small businesses under NAICS Code 721110 are being solicited resulting in a COMPETITIVELY awarded purchase order contract.  The small business size standard for NAICS code 721110 is $7,000,000 or less.<BR><BR>The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide contracted services as set forth below and in any and all attachments.<BR><BR>PROVISIONS/CLAUSES:  Please see attached REQUEST FOR QUOTE - CLIN LIST for all provisions and clauses that will/may apply to this solicitation and/or purchase order contract.<BR><BR>The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this procedure. <BR><BR>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<BR><BR>QUOTES MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:<BR>a) A list of three references for a similar stay.
