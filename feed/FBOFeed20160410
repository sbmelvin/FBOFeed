<DESC><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) SINLEC16Q0010. Submit written offers. Oral offers will not be accepted. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). This procurement is being issued as 100% Small Business set-aside. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Regulation, North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 541990 and Size Standard of $15 million apply to this procurement.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:<br />The Department of State's, Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, mission is to create a more secure, democratic, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and international community. We strive to build and maintain enduring peace by strengthening security, providing assistance, and seizing the opportunity to restore civil trust and rule of law.</p>
<p>Job task analysis is a widely used and nationally recognized tool for validating job content, training effectiveness, and assessing employee performance. The tool is instrumental in almost all human resource departments especially in career fields where the environment is rapidly changing and consolidating information is difficult.</p>
<p>The Department of State, Kenya's National Police Service (NPS) and Kenya's National Police Service Commission (NPSC) need an efficient and effective means to analyze and study police performance with specific-activity based results to improve and modify current human resource practices within the police service. See attached Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>PRICE PROPOSAL<br />The Contractor shall propose price using the below line item structure. The Government intends on issuing a single Firm Fixed Price contract with one cost reimbursable line item for travel and visa. The Contractor shall seek prior approval from the Contracting Officer to ensure funds availability. Each travel request must include number of personnel, length of stay, and performance objective with a cost estimate.</p>
<p><br />DELIVERABLE PWS REF. SUSPENSE EXTENDED PRICE</p>
<p>0001 - BASE PERIOD RESULTS REPORT (FFP) 1.1.1 - 1.1.5 NTE 3 MONTHS 01 MAY 2016 - 01 JUL 2016 <br />0002 - BASE PERIOD RECOMMENDATION REPORT (FFP) 1.1.1, - 1.1.4, and 1.1.6 NTE 6 MONTHS 01 MAY 2016 - 01 OCT 2016<br />0003 - TRAVEL (COST REIMBURSABLE) <br />0004 - OPTION PERIOD ONE RESULTS REPORT (FFP) 1.1.1 - 1.1.5 NTE 3 MONTHS 01 MAY 2017 - 01 JUL 2017 <br />0005 - OPTION PERIOD ONE RECOMMENDATION REPORT (FFP) 1.1.1, - 1.1.4, and 1.1.6 NTE 6 MONTHS 01 MAY 2017 - 01 OCT 2017<br />0006 - TRAVEL (COST REIMBURSABLE)</p>
<p>* Deliverable dates are subject to changes as established by the Contractor; however, must not exceed a total nine month period of performance. JTA has never been performed for the National Police Service. Therefore, unknowns are potential but the scope of work shall be confined to the Offeror's technical proposal. There are potentially up to 40 different departments all small in volume of people but similar to U.S. police procedures in complexity. The Offeror must travel but is not expected to live in Kenya the entire duration. Technological capability will be sporadically supported to not at all. The Offeror will be provided a business work space at the Kenyan Commission where they will be provided a liason to assist in translation, travel, and points of contact. We highly encourage Offerors to propose findings and solutions based on best practices. The results of the proposed contract action, if successful, are critical to the future of Kenya's stability and the U.S. Government.</p>
