A total of 6,900 feet of channel comprises this project which includes the reach into the turning basin.  The Federal Navigation Channel begins in Upsher Bay and continues to within approximately 600 feet of Quinby Landing.  The channel geometry along this reach is 8 feet deep and 80 feet wide.  The next reach of the channel narrows to 60 feet wide.  This reach is defined from a point 600 feet out of the harbor / turning basin and terminates at Quinby Landing.  The harbor / turning basin's surface dimensions are 200 feet wide by 400 feet long.  The dredging work consists of dredging to a required depth of 7 feet; one additional foot of overdepth dredging will be allowed.  It is estimated that approximately 177,200 cubic yards of maintenance dredged material, to include allowable overdepth, will be removed.  All dredging depths are referenced to Mean Lower Low Water.  Hydraulic pipeline dredging will be required to complete the project.  Dredged material will be placed at a near shore and overboard placement area adjacent to the channel.

<DESC>MAINTENANCE DREDGING, QUINBY CREEK, TOWN OF QUINBY, ACCOMACK COUNTY, VIRGINIA.   <br>   The Quinby Creek Channel and Harbor Turning Basin are located in Accomack County, Virginia near the town of Quinby.  A total of 6,900 feet of channel comprises this project which includes the reach into the turning basin.  The Federal Navigation Channel begins in Upsher Bay and continues to within approximately 600 feet of Quinby Landing.  Authorized geometry along this reach is 8 feet deep and 80 feet wide.  The next reach of the channel narrows to 60 feet wide.  This reach is defined from a point 600 feet out of the harbor / turning basin and terminates at Quinby Landing.  The harbor / turning basin's surface dimensions are 200 feet wide by 400 feet long.  The dredging work consists of dredging to a required depth of 6 feet; one additional foot of overdepth dredging will be allowed.  It is estimated that approximately 143,000 cubic yards of maintenance dredged material, to include allowable overdepth, will be removed.  All dredging depths are referenced to Mean Lower Low Water.  Hydraulic pipeline dredging will be required to complete the project.  Dredged material will be placed at a near shore and overboard placement area adjacent to the channel.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract using INVITATION FOR BID WITH PRE-AWARD SURVEY and procedures outlined in FAR 36 and FAR 14.  Pre-award survey will determine contracts responsibility in accordance with FAR 9.104 and 9.106.   <br>   Bidders will be evaluated on both pre-award survey and conformance to the solicitation and price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all Bids; and to award the contract to other than the lowest total price and to award to the bidder submitting the lowest bid determined by the Government to be responsible.  The contract duration is 240 calendar days .    Dredging restrictions for this project are effective from July 01 through 30 September 2015.  The magnitude of construction is estimated to be between $1,000,000.00 - $5,000,000.00.  The solicitation will be posted on/about 19 February 2014.  The receipt date for Bids is 20 March 2015 by 10:00 a.m.  NAICS CODE 237990 ($27.5M) applies to this procurement .   Bid bonds will be required with bid submittals.  Search on W91236% for solicitations issued by Norfolk District.  No hard copies will be available.  Prospective contractors must be registered Vendors with https//www.fbo.gov in order to download plans and specifications.  Prospective contractors must be registered in the DOD System for Award Management (SAM) database in order to obtain access to FEDBIZOPPS.   It is incumbent upon vendors to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the solicitation, specification, drawings, and all subsequent amendments.  SAM Registration must also be ACTIVE and current to be eligible for contract award.  Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-866-606-8220 or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will prevent access to FEDBIZOPPS and will make a Bidder ineligible for award.  NOTE:  Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) apply to this solicitation.  With ORCA, vendors have the ability to enter and maintain representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov; therefore, vendors no longer have to submit representations and certifications with bid.  Instead, this solicitation contains a single provision that will allow vendor to either certify that all representations and certification in ORCA are current, complete, and accurate as of the date of signature, or list any changes.   <br>
