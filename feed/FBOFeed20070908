Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency (AIR 2.0) is seeking potential vendors/schools capable of providing an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel.     

1.0        BACKGROUND

           One of the key management objectives of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency is for its contracting professionals to better understand the key financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.     This management objective supports DODs emphasis on smarter acquisitions while continuing to support the needs of the Services.     The Aerospace Industry has historically been successful in educating itself on the inner workings of the various DOD organizations in an effort to better understand their customers.     The NAVAIR Contracts Competency asserts that it is equally important for its employees to have knowledge of the motivations and decision points of its key suppliers.     Mutual understanding makes for healthier business relationships.           

2.0       SCOPE

           This Request for Information (RFI) outlines a potential requirement for an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel in the NAVAIR Contracts Competency (NAVAIR Code 2.0).     (Note:  The Contracts Competency includes contracting personnel at NAVAIR Headquarters at Patuxent River, MD; Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division (AD) with sites at Patuxent River, MD and Lakehurst, NJ; NAWC Training Systems Division at Orlando, FL; and NAWC Weapons Division (WD) at China Lake, CA.     The term NAVAIR Code 2.0 includes all contracts specialists at all sites.)     The brief/survey will provide a comprehensive look into the overall health of the Aerospace Industry with an objective of helping the civilian and military contracting personnel at NAVAIR better understand the financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.     The following information is given so that all potential sources (contractors) may better understand the requirement.     The contractor shall focus the training on the largest twelve (12) Aerospace companies based on 2006 annual revenues.     The contractor shall work in conjunction with NAVAIR Code 2.0 leadership to develop and deliver the briefing.     The contractor shall prepare the Code 2.0 leadership to present the educational brief; the desire here is to train the trainers to conduct training at the Lakehurst, NJ; China Lake, CA; and Orlando, FL sites, and to conduct the training on a continuing basis.     The contractor is strongly encouraged to suggest approaches to fulfilling managements objective.     

3.0        REQUIREMENTS 

           The contractor shall design, develop, present, and deliver a comprehensive educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry, for all civilian and military contracting personnel as deemed appropriate by NAVAIR Code 2.0 leadership.

The contractor shall provide administrative support as required to deliver the brief/survey.     Method and delivery of brief/survey should be coordinated with NAVAIR representative.     

     The contractor shall provide in the brief/survey the following content but not to be limited by or anchored to the following:

Projected trends for the commercial business, potential merger and acquisitions, etc shall also be addressed.     The contractor will focus on the twelve (12) largest industry leaders by using 2006 revenues as a foundation for focus.

2.       Financial due diligence for the top twelve (12) industry leaders with performance metrics comparison, i.e. P/E, debt/equity, annual sales, market share, trends in each.     The overall financial health of the Aerospace Industry should be the focus.

3.       The contractor shall address the financial motivations which drive decision making in the Aerospace Industry.     The point of highlighting financial motivations is for the NAVAIR contracting personnel to better understand why the Aerospace Industry behaves as it does.     Excellent examples include profit expectations, risk analysis, and investor perceptions.

4.       The brief/survey shall include an analysis of the top twelve (12) industry players based on 2006 revenues with DOD/Commercial breakout to include DOD segmentation by service, program office, etc.     Examples include:     Company A has 60% of its business commercial and 40% DOD.

<DESC>Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency (AIR 2.0) is seeking potential vendors/schools capable of providing an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel.  



1.0 	BACKGROUND

     One of the key management objectives of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Contracts Competency is for its contracting professionals to better understand the key financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.  This management objective supports DODs emphasis on smarter acquisitions while continuing to support the needs of the Services.  The Aerospace Industry has historically been successful in educating itself on the inner workings of the various DOD organizations in an effort to better understand their customers.  The NAVAIR Contracts Competency asserts that it is equally important for its employees to have knowledge of the motivations and decision points of its key suppliers.  Mutual understanding makes for healthier business relationships.     

2.0	SCOPE

     This Request for Information (RFI) outlines a potential requirement for an educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry to approximately 650 NAVAIR contracting personnel in the NAVAIR Contracts Competency (NAVAIR Code 2.0).  (Note:  The Contracts Competency includes contracting personnel at NAVAIR Headquarters at Patuxent River, MD; Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Aircraft Division (AD) with sites at Patuxent River, MD and Lakehurst, NJ; NAWC Training Systems Division at Orlando, FL; and NAWC Weapons Division (WD) at China Lake, CA.  The term NAVAIR Code 2.0 includes all contracts specialists at all sites.)  The brief/survey will provide a comprehensive look into the overall health of the Aerospace Industry with an objective of helping the civilian and military contracting personnel at NAVAIR better understand the financial and business motivations of the Aerospace Industry.  The following information is give so that all potential sources (contractors) may better understand requirement.  The contractor shall focus the training on the largest twelve (12) Aerospace companies based on 2006 annual revenues.  The contractor shall work in conjunction with NAVAIR Code 2.0 leadership to develop and deliver the briefing.  The contractor shall prepare the Code 2.0 leadership to present the educational brief; the desire here is to train the trainers to conduct training at the Lakehurst, NJ; China Lake, CA; and Orlando, FL sites, and to conduct the training on a continuing basis.  The contractor is strongly encouraged to suggest approaches to fulfilling management?s objective.  

3.0 	REQUIREMENTS 

     The contractor shall design, develop, present, and deliver a comprehensive educational brief/survey on the Aerospace Industry, for all civilian and military contracting personnel as deemed appropriate by NAVAIR Code 2.0 leadership.

5.	Other points to address in the brief/survey include - contract decision mechanisms (insights on bid & proposal processes), competitive position (within their defense/aerospace markets and relative to one another, and partnership/teaming, strategic vision (in terms of their own business/investment aspirations).

<SUBJECT>J -- CDC Organizational Property Maintenance Service Agreement  for Antiquated Copiers - Digitech
<DESC>0HJAA217-2007-47237  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis (i.e. non-competitive basis), a purchase order to Digitech of 3588 South Melissa Lane, Douglasville, GA 30135. The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1.  FAR Part 13 is applicable; to exclude FAR Part 13.5, as the estimated cost does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The requirement is a total small business set aside. The purchase order is for services related to the relocation of CDC owned copiers from the Chamblee Campus located in Atlanta, Georgia to the Century Center Campus located in Atlanta, Georgia. This service agreement is to include the continued repair, scheduled servicing, overhauling, rebuilding, and relocating of copiers that have exceeded there average life expectancy, thus are in need of repair but are no longer under warranty and/or supported by the original manufacturer due in part to obsolescence, as well as, damage and extreme wear and tear. See the attached document for a listing of CDC owned antiquated copiers that are in need of servicing and/or repair to reinstate functionality by design. The period of performance is one year (or 12 consecutive months) following the award of a U.S. Government Purchase Order. Market research revealed that Digitech was the only company capable of servicing such a wide variety of products that were no longer supported by the original manufacturers. It is believed that Digitech is the only available responsible source, as they possess unique skills and qualifications to perform these services. This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. Firms that believe they can provide the services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer on or before the posted response date of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires may be sent to Russell Oxford by e-mail at efn3@cdc.gov or by fax to 770-488-2670.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for the following items:

Period of performance for this entire effort is expected to be approximately 30 Sep 2007 to 29 Sep 2008 

CLIN 0001:    Envoy Professional Notification Package, (Qty = 1)                 

CLIN 0002:    Additional Sub-Administrators, (Qty = 30)                 

CLIN 0003:    Additional Capacity Agreement for 16,000 Database Records, (Qty = 1)

CLIN 0004:    Envoy Message Center Calling System, (Qty = 1)

CLIN 0005:    Message Center Set Up Service, (Qty = 1)

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:           Envoy Worldwide is the sole provider of Envoy notification services.  Envoy notification services are currently in use by NGA.  Interruption of this service would put NGA at risk in meeting NGA's mission of supporting National Defense objectives, Homeland Security, and Humanitarian support.  Additionally, the Envoy services solution is the only notification system that meets the following requirements:  1.  The hosted solution must be based in the Untied States, 2.  The solution must have more than one secure data warehouse geographically separated, 3.  The solution must not employ foreign nationals, 4.  The solution must provide resiliency of service and data with respect to multiple telephone providers.  

Due to the fact that Envoy notification services are already in use at NGA, switching to a new notification service would not meet NGA's requirements of form, fit, and function, nor could NGA change over to a new notification solution quickly and easily.  It would be very costly to transition to a new notification system and such a transition would require a large amount of time to test the new system and to re-train our personnel to use the new system.  Such a transition would result in unacceptable work delays and substantially inflated costs.

<DESC>In reference to solicitation GPC07TWCF203MXG

Amendment 1

Purpose: To answer question submitted by potential offerors.

Question:

The brand which is requested is manufactured by Clayton Associates, Inc. The products being requested are DM-304 and DM-504. In the additional requirements section of this solicitation it requires that the system must be explosion proof. After having reviewed these models, nowhere does the manufacturer mention that they are in fact certified explosion proof. Before we can provide you with a quote for similar items, would it be pssible that you request a certification from the manufacturer, and which nationally recognized testing laboratory provided them with the certification. 

Answer:

The manufacturer provides the following explanation:
?Clayton Assoiciates, Inc. air powered vacuums have no electrical components and no moving parts. As such, these vacumms are inherently safe.
To eliminate the potential spark or ignition due to static electricity, all Clayton vacuum sanding systems are bonded in accordance with the NFPA?s publication ?Static Electricity 2007 Recommended Practice on Static Electricity?.
The entire system somprising sanders, hoses and vacuum is bonded. In addition to the use of a static ground wire within the combination vacuum and compressed air hose the vacuum hose itself has a static dissipating additive.
Each vacuum is equipped with MIL-standard aircraft grounding receptacle that accepts the MIL-standard aircraft grounding wires. This allows for bonding the vacuum system to the aircraft or parts sanded thereby making them the same electrical potential. This provision also allows the sytem to be grounded to earth.?

No legal certification will be required. Vendors are reminded that if they offer a product other than the Clayton product (an ?or equal?), they must furnish technical literature for evaluation.

Additional information from the manufacturer: There are a few changes in part numbers from what is requested. We no longer manufacture 672-61JP and now item 650-201 is included in the DM-304.

Deadline for receipt of bids has been changed until September 12, 2007, at 4:30 PM, local time.

All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
