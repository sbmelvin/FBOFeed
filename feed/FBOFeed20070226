The following information is provided as detailed information and definitions on the items listed above and are included for informational purposes only: InfraRed (IR) Beacons The IR beacon will provide the means of positively identifying the user as a “friendly” entity to personnel equipped with image intensifying systems, such as Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).   The IR beacon will be powered by a standard 9-volt battery (BA-3090), and operate at a wavelength of 880 nanometers (nM), with a minimum light intensity of 750 milli-Candela (mCd).  It will have a “flicker rate” of one flash every 1.3 seconds, with a duration of 20 milliseconds per flash.  The IR beacon will have a minimum visibility range of 5 miles, a minimum battery life of 100 hours, and be waterproof and interoperable with the V-IPAK.  IR beacon specifications:  weight not to exceed 1 ounce, and dimensions not to exceed 1”x 1.5”x 0.5”.     InfraRed (IR) Reflective Personnel Marking Devices The personnel markers will provide the means to positively identify the user as a “friendly” entity to personnel equipped with image intensifying systems—such as Night Vision Goggles (NVGs)—and associated IR emitters—such as IR lasers, aimers, or IR searchlights.  The markers will consist of IR reflective tape, with an operating wavelength of 830-1060 nanometers (nM) and 0.5 degree reflection angle, and a means to secure the marker to the uniform.  To the unaided eye, the texture and finish of the IR reflective tape will appear similar to black duct tape and exhibit no reflective glow.  Uniform Personnel Marker Specifications:  Markers for the battle dress uniform (BDU) will be “button-on,” 2”x 2” squares of IR reflective material that is sewn on to a canvas backing.  This backing will have two button holes located at the top of the canvas square to attach the marker to the shoulder pocket buttons of the BDU.  Helmet Personnel Marker Specifications:  Markers for the combat h!  elmet will be 1”x 1” squares of IR reflective material that is secured to durable plastic “tabs.”  These tabs will be approximately 1”x 4”, and the IR reflective markers will be positioned in the center of the tabs.  The left and right sides of the plastic tabs will be designed as hooks that, when inserted into the slits of the helmet cover, will secure the marker to the combat helmet.   Vehicle Installation and Power Adapter Kits (V-IPAKs) The V-IPAK will provide the means to temporarily affix an InfraRed (IR) beacon to a host platform’s antenna mast, in a position where it can easily be observed, and an alternative source of electrical power to the beacon’s standard 9-volt battery (BA-3090).  This alternative source of power will be provided by connecting the V-IPAK to the host platform’s 12-volt battery, converting platform power to 9-volts, and coupling the IR beacon with the device’s beacon mounting base.  V-IPAK Specifications:  weight not to exceed 12 ounces, dimensions not to exceed 2”x 2”x 2”, power source not to exceed 12 Volt Direct Current (VDC), and minimum cable length 20’. Thermal Identification Panels (TIPs) When viewed through a thermal imaging system (TIS), such as a M1A1/2 tank’s Generation (GEN) II TIS gunner’s sight, the TIP will provide a means to positively identify the user (personnel and platforms) as a “friendly” entity in the battlespace by presenting a contrasting “cold spot in the hot target image.”  The TIP will be an approved-for-joint-service, “Quick Fix” program thermal reflective marker for use with thermal sights and viewers operating in the 3 to 12 micron wavelengths.  It will be clearly observable and distinguishable at ranges extending to 1,000 meters.  Personnel TIP Specifications:  Will be designed for use by dismounted Marines and, potentially, on ground equipment.  Overall dimensions will be 2’x 2’.  One side of the panel will be covered with U.S. Army approved, tan-colored thermal tape for thermal operations, while the other side will be covered with non-thermal, orange-colored, parachute ripstop, nylon fabric for visual operations.  For panel employme!  nt, grommets and Velcro will be sewn into the panel at each corner; and a carrying case will be provided so that the panel can be folded and stored in the Marine’s uniform pockets.  Platform TIP Specifications:  Will be designed for use on ground platforms.  Overall dimensions will be 4’x 4’.  One side of the panel will be covered with U.S. Army approved, light-chocolate-brown-colored thermal tape for thermal operations, while the other side will be covered with non-thermal, orange-colored reinforced Cordura nylon for visual operations.  For panel installation, eight heavy-duty grommets will be sewn into the panel at each corner and midway in between.  A carrying case will also be provided for easy storage.                                    Offerors shall submit quotes in accordance with .Federal Acquisition Regulation-52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, (Jan 2004) with FOB Destination prices.

TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Ray Meilunas (301) 342-8064 I. INTRODUCTION. The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Polymers & Composites Branch of the Aerospace Materials Division under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of polymers and composite materials and structures to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. II. BACKGROUND. The mission of the Polymers & Composites Branch of the NAVAIR Aerospace Materials Division is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposer include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST. New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing applied to polymers and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation composite applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural composites (including tooling); new and novel materials, processes and design methods for structural repair of composites, or repair of non-composite structure with composites; process modeling; engineered materials for low-observable applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Applique and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding, non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; Nanomaterials and structural nanocomposites; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers & composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings for aircraft transparencies and their repair; self-healing, -sensing and -adapting polymers and composites; smart and adaptive (morphing) materials and structures; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials; biomaterials and biomimetic materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office. IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at  http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/grants.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government. NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

<DESC>The Surveillance Research Program within the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, plans to negotiate with the CHEROKEE NATION, Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for a contract, for a two-year period plus three one-year options, to continue capacity building for a cancer registry for the American Indians residing in the 14-county Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdictional Service Area (TJSA) who are eligible for health care through Tribal or Indian Health Service (IHS)-operated health care facilities.  Currently the number of eligible users is approximately 100,000. The ultimate goal of the project is the establishment of a population-based cancer registry, to be called the Cherokee Nation Cancer Registry, that will meet the standards of the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program in case finding, patient follow-up, data processing, data reporting, and quality assurance by July 31, 2012.  At that time the contract may be extended to maintain the registry at SEER standards.  The information to be collected will assist in measuring the burden of cancer among American Indian populations of the United States.  With the data, NCI anticipates improving its estimates for cancer rates among this group.  It is expected that the Cherokee Nation shall share costs for the establishment of the registry and assist in the development of agreements with the hospitals, clinics, pathology laboratories and other entities where data on American Indian cancer cases can be obtained.  The statutory authority for the noncompetitive acquisition is 41 USC 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Numbered Note 22 is included and reads as follows:   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<ARCHDATE>02292008
<CONTACT>Norma Weikert, 937-255-1896
<DESC>52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. This is a Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 52.215-3 --   Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of  this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except  as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection  31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although “proposal” and “offeror” are used in this Request for  Information, your response will be treated as information only.  It shall  not be used as a proposal. (c) Background:  The C-17 Training Systems Integrated Product Team at  Wright-Patterson AFB OH is responsible for the development, fielding and  sustainment of aircrew and maintenance training devices, concurrency of  those devices, and aircrew instruction.  The breadth of this effort  expands across eight USAF bases in CONUS, two in PACAF, and an Australian  FMS base.  The C-17 Aircrew Training System (ATS) is comprised of seven  different training devices of which, to date, 163 out of 179 devices have  been fielded.  The C-17 Maintenance Training System (MTS), on the other  hand, is comprised of ten different devices with 28 of 37 devices fielded.  Whereas ATS devices can be found at every C-17 base, only seven USAF bases  will eventually house the MTS devices. (d) The purpose of this RFI is to assist the program office with the  formulation of the acquisition strategy and to ascertain your interest in  bidding on a 10-year C-17 ATS/MTS Sustainment Re-Compete program.  This  program is comprised of three components; 1) ATS and MTS Contractor  Logistics Support (CLS), 2) ATS Instruction, and 3) ATS and MTS  Concurrency Management.  The offerors will be asked to bid on a combined  program encapsulating all of the components list above.  They will also be  given the opportunity to bid on an ATS-only piece  (CLS/Instruction/Concurrency) and/or an MTS-only piece (CLS/Concurrency). 1.  Describe your past experience for performing contractor logistics  support, instruction, and/or concurrency management to include: •	Program name •	Government or contractor POC •	Description of the effort; i.e., number of locations supported, number  of personnel assigned, etc. •	Date & period of performance •	Cost of effort •	Description of support strategy, i.e., guaranteed student, on-call,  modified on-call, etc. 2.	In an effort to instill contractual flexibility to react quickly to  budget fluctuations, we’re looking for ways to implement a “throttle”  mechanism.  By this we want the capability to surge as well a scale back  on the CLS effort.  What ideas might you have to accomplish this and have  you implemented it on a previous program? 3.  What innovative ways have you used in the past, or could possibly  envision to keep CLS costs down to include integrating the two systems  together? 4.  In carrying out this effort, what would be your reliance on government  personnel and what would be required of them? 5.  What data will you require of the government to assemble a proposal  for this effort? 6.  What risks do you foresee in performing this effort?  What steps would  you likely take to mitigate the risks? Contractors responding to this announcement should indicate their size,  particularly if they are a small business, a socially and economically  disadvantaged business, a woman-owned business, a HUB zone small business  concern, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Native  American-Owned Small Business, and should also indicate if the company is  foreign-owned.  Interested sources are encouraged to first register as a  source on the PIXS Web Site (www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil).  Interested sources  must respond with a complete Request for Information package of no more  than 10 pages though, providing everything requested above. All parties  are asked to provide a point of contact, a telephone number, an e-mail  address, and a facsimile number in their response. This information should be sent electronically to Mr Rick Fennell at  ricky.fennell@wpafb.af.mil.  Responses should be received no later than 15  March 2007.

The Government will provide as many vacant houses as possible for the initial start-up.  After that period the owner will in conjunction, with the Contractor, provide as many homes as possible in as close proximity to one another as possible.  A schedule will be established and the only alteration or change to the schedule will be when a home is vacated for the benefit of the agency.  There  should be 65 remaining homes and they consist of single, duplex and quadri-plex configuration.  It would be advantageous for any contractor interested to make a site visit.  The agency reserves the right to make changes to the schedule due to unforseen circumstances; however; the agency will make every effort to keep as closely to the original schedule so as not to inconvenience the Contractor.

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has a requirement for a software and professional services firm to design, develop, integrate, test, and deploy a Multichannel Publishing solution that supports the Web Content Unit and the Communications Division, both of the Public Affairs Department. The solution will consist of a Web Content Management System (WCMS) and a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) based electronic publishing solution to support the authoring, editing, publication and dissemination of content in multiple formats (.PDF, .DOC, .HTML, .XML). 

OCC produces many official publications ? news releases, legal interpretations, policy guidance documents, and lengthy procedures handbooks related to its bank supervision and licensing activities. Although OCC still makes available paper copies of its publications, the primary distribution mechanism is now the agency?s three web sites. OCC has determined that its processes and the technologies for production and distribution of publications and Web content are obsolete. OCC has undertaken the Multichannel Publishing System Implementation to address the Web content and publication production business functions. This system is key to achieving a wholesale overhaul of the OCC web sites that is underway as part of the OCC Web Site of the Future initiative.  

The OCC issued a Request for Information for E-Publishing/Web Site of the Future to industry during July 2006, and received inputs from interested offerors on August 11, 2006. Based on the information collected in market research and upon further analysis by the Government, the OCC has determined that the forthcoming competitive acquisition will be for a single, winner-take-all contract with the winning prime contractor providing OCC a Multichannel Publishing solution under one consolidated effort.  

This is a new requirement and the solicitation is unrestricted.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541512.  The acquisition strategy for this procurement will entail an advisory multi-step process which will allow the Government an opportunity to advise contractors about their potential to be a viable competitor in the competitive process, in accordance with FAR 15.202.

The OCC will evaluate all responses to this notice and advise each respondent in writing either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  All respondents considered not to be viable competitors will be advised of the general basis for that opinion. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the OCC in response to their submission, all respondents may participate in the resultant acquisition. The OCC will execute a ?best value? procurement that focuses on technical feasibility, system integrator past performance, solution organizational impact, and price.  Solution organizational impact includes both solution support and operation within the OCC environment.  

In order to be deemed competitively viable firms shall at a minimum (1) propose viable integrated content management solutions that are achievable within the OCC organization and technical infrastructure, (2) have demonstrated mature Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems integration engineering practices and implementation approaches that follow the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model Integration, Extreme Programming, or similar model for its process improvement approach, (3) have qualified key personnel that will be assigned to the project.  The key personnel must be experienced in content management, web content management, and systems integration, and (4) have documented or customer surveyed past performance developing and implementing solutions of similar scope.  

The OCC has developed a preliminary vision of the solution. The preliminary vision of the solution consists of a proven technical architecture that uses COTS or Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products that either ?out-of-the-box?, integrates with other COTS/GOTS or customized satisfy the requirements of the Multichannel Publishing system. Key attributes of Multichannel Publishing solution are as follows:

?	The solution must be capable of managing three Web properties with a total display page count of approximately 100,000 pages (because each Web page will consist of a number of content objects, the total number of content objects to support will be significantly higher.)
?	The solution must offer distributed publication authoring and editing capabilities that allow for online commenting and the tracking of changes similar to that of Microsoft Word.
?	The solution must manage content as objects smaller than the section level of a publication or an individual Web page. It must track information about these content objects, including metadata, relationships to other objects, object versioning information, and security permissions.
?	The solution must manage content objects as source objects. The source objects must be able to be reused in multiple publications and the relationships between the source objects and the multiple publications must be managed.
?	The solution must be capable of disassembling into section-level content objects, publications that have been authored using a pre-determined template or style sheet.
?	The solution must be able to assemble content objects for presentation to the user in multiple presentation formats such as PDF, HTML, MS Word. The solution must be capable of assembling presentation output based on information it stores about content objects (e.g. content type or metadata.) 
?	The solution must support presentation templates to provide a mechanism for ensuring consistency in the presentation layer and to limit the effort associated with managing a collection of many thousands of output pages. The solution must be capable of separating content from presentation so that content can be presented in a variety of formats.
?	The solution must distribute content objects through the intranet directly to the users? desktops and assemble the objects into publications on the desktops for use off-line. The solution should allow the user to control the execution of the intranet download.
?	The solution must validate and synchronize select publication content located on a user?s desktop with content managed within the solution.
?	The solution must provide a mechanism for servicing internal and external users, who have limited bandwidth network access, are using devices with restricted display capabilities, or who need access to the OCC?s content while operating disconnected from the network.
?	The solution must provide user desktop information retrieval mechanisms to facilitate focused and component level information retrieval efforts.
?	The solution must be capable of personalized content presentation. For OCC employees, the solution must allow for the authentication of the user against the OCC directory (Active Directory-based) and the tailoring of content to defined groups and roles. The solution must allow external and internal users control over the content they receive via OCC Web properties.
?	The solution must be Section 508 compliant.

The OCC is requesting prospective respondents to provide the following technical information:

?	Statement of Qualification ? The statement of qualifications should provide the OCC insight into the respondent?s ability to provide the services and solutions required to meet the key attributes listed above. The statement of qualifications shall also provide information regarding the methodologies that would be used in order to provide the services.
?	Conceptual Multichannel Publishing System Technical Solution ? The conceptual technical solution shall provide the OCC insight into the proposed components and software necessary to satisfy the key attributes listed above. It shall provide a technical description that describes both graphically and in text, the necessary components of the solution. The technical description shall also provide an estimated level of integration necessary between components.
?	Respondent Past Performance ? The respondent should provide at least three examples of past implementations of the conceptual solution proposed above. Examples of implementations within government organizations of similar size as the OCC are encouraged.

Written submissions are limited to a maximum of 30 pages (including attachments, samples, documentation, etc.). Pages in excess of the maximum will not be reviewed.

Firms desiring consideration must submit five (5) copies of the required information if submitting hard copies.  The copies shall be submitted to:  Esther Clemons, 250 E Street, SW, Mail Stop: 4-13, Washington, DC 20219-0001.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract for Tomahawk Block IV Full Rate Production (FRP).  The Navy intends to award a contract with one base year and two option years.  Contract award is planned for the first quarter fiscal year 2009.  This requirement includes the hardware manufacture of Canistered Surface Ship Capable, Encapsulated Submarine Torpedo-Tube Launched, and Encapsulated Submarine Vertical Launch Tomahawk Block IV All-Up-Round (AUR) missiles and related equipment and services.  The contract may include hardware manufacturing and testing; sustaining engineering; Composite Capsule Launching System (CCLS) Capsules; SSGN compatible CCLS Retrofit Kits; Special Tooling and Special Test Equipment; procurement of Range Safety Systems and Flight Test Kits; Operational Test Launch (OTL) Flight Testing, Product Verification Testing and Functional Ground Testing; Guidance Test Set upgrades, support, maintenance and repair; refurbishment of containers and capsules; Government Furnished Equipment repair and upgrade; engineering and test support; various elements of logistics support; and Tomahawk Block IV training courses.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RMS has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS).  RMS solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tomahawk Block IV missile, and is the only source capable of meeting scheduled thresholds for Fleet load outs of the Tomahawk Block IV missile.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tomahawk Block IV missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RMS is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST has identified the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation as a key component for overseas Consular windows, interviewing booths and staff offices.  The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation was selected for this purpose because of the results obtained by Creative Information Technology, Inc. to replace a like number of older PCs used overseas in Consular interviewing booths and staff offices. The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation is only small form factor workstation that fully meets Consular needs, and was selected for the following reasons: 1) It is a specific all-in-one configuration that includes three separate components: the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation, a 19-inch Dell flat panel monitor, and a stand.  It occupies less than 1/3 of the space used by conventional mini-tower PCs deployed by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and eliminates overcrowding common to interviewing booths and visa issuance desks.  Moreover, the Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation provides additional space with an opening underneath the monitor that can be used for keyboard storage or to corral small office supplies. This space can be significantly useful to users with limited workspace.   2) It is the only small form factor PC manufactured that combines the screen display, processor, and all other components in one compact unit, while still allowing the components to separate from each other.  This feature is useful when one piece of the all-in-one configuration is malfunctioning and must be replaced.      3) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation complies with CA’s baseline standard for desktop PCs and is fully compatible with the Consular HW and SW environments. The following Consular Affairs overseas applications were tested for functionality: ACRS, ACS, ACS+, ST, CST_PWD, INK, IVO, and NIV. 4) The Dell OptiPlex GX745 SFF workstation has BTX (balance technology extended) chassis, power supply, and motherboard that are designed for thermal efficiency providing improved reliability and quieter operation.

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY & ASSESSEMENT (Revision 1: to correct Size Standard NAIC code 541330 From $6.5M To $4.5M 3 yr Avg In Accordance with U.S. Business Administration) Program Management, Acquisition Management, System Engineering, Operations Planning for the FAA Office of Technology Development  This public announcement is being issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.1.3.12.  This is not a solicitation announcement.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Since this is an informational announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents at this time. PURPOSE:   The purpose of this market survey is to: 1) inform Industry of an upcoming procurement;  2) solicit comments on the Statement of Work; 3) assess market interest and capability of potential offerors. BACKGROUND: The Directorate of Operations Planning Technology Development Services, ATO-P  provides aviation engineering services that are an integral component of the National Airspace System (NAS) planning and operational system.  The NAS provides the flying public with air traffic control services designed to ensure air transportation safety.  ATO-P is responsible for providing technical and engineering direction and program management for multiple projects through various stages of development and NAS implementation.  ATO-P must satisfy the technical requirements of the NAS as envisioned and implemented by the FAA. The Draft Statement of work (SOW) is attached.  Included are specific project tasks and general tasks. A Screening Information Request (SIR) is anticipating being released in late March early April 2007. We are considering use of a Cost Reimbursement "Cost Plus Fixed Fee" type contract.  The government estimate for this procurement is approximately $9 Million over a 5 year period.   Responses to the below Capability Statement questions are to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competitive procurement for small business. The North American Industry Classification Code designated for this procurement is 541330 Engineering Services. This classification uses $4.5 Million annual gross sales 3 year average as the threshold to be considered a small business.  The FAA requests the following information from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement - Please answer the following questions: A. Has your firm provided similar type services or supported similar type Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) programs as described in the SOW. How recently?  If so please elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance. B. Please provide additional comments regarding the SOW and any other relative comments and suggestions.  2. Discuss expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.). If respondent is an SBA 8(a) certified business, or other small business, provide a strategy in terms of percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent. 3. Completion of the attached Business Declaration form. And if applicable, a copy of the interested vendors 8(a) Certification Form.  This should include all necessary signatures and its expiration date. A vendor's failure to respond to this market survey does not necessitate that vendor's exclusion from the competition.  However, the failure of adequate small business participation in this market survey may result in the government determining there are not sufficient qualified small business' interested to set aside this procurement  for small business. Therefore, a full and open competition would be considered.  Interested companies can register for future announcements related to this and any procurement by Going to the FAA Website address: "http://www.asu.faa.gov/faaco/index.cfm, which is the "Contract Opportunities" site.  Should you want the e-mail automatic notification of FAA opportunities you may look under the column "Main Menu" and click on e-Mail Auto-Notify System.

<DESC>This note replaces a notice that was erroneously deleted on FedBizOpps and which advises that Amendment 0002 has been posted in the Business Opportunities section of the following NAVAIR TSD website: 

http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?client=NAWCTSD

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division (NAWCTSD) has a requirement to support the Navy?s Command Aircraft Crew Training (CACT) program which includes providing all labor, equipment, training facilities, tools, training materials, training devices, supervision and other services necessary for classroom, trainer, and simulator training for Navy C-40A (Boeing 737-700C with increased gross weight (IGW) as configured for U.S. Navy) aircrew.  

The C-40A CACT program requires classroom (academic and practical) training, a Cockpit Familiarization Trainer (CFT) that depicts all cockpit systems, a Part Task Trainer (PTT) (for aircraft system training with trainee input and trainer response capability), and a FAA level "C" or higher simulator.  In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level "C" or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.  The training courses must be presented at a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 142 certified training center for the Boeing 737-700 IGW aircraft at time of training.  Instructors must be certified under Title 14 CFR Part 142.  The contractor will be required to submit training syllabus for each course for government approval.

For all courses, the contractor shall provide: All the necessary facilities, certified instructors, management personnel, scheduling/administrative personnel; materials; rights for use of materials for this contracted training, training devices, simulators; and courseware/materials needed for each course.  Pilot Initial course attendees will be designated Military Aviators.  Pilot Recurrent course attendees will be qualified Military C-40 Pilot-in-Command or Second Pilot Military Aviators that will have normally completed the C-40 Pilot Initial Course.  Pilot Recurrent training will be broken into 3 distinct tracks identified as follows:  1.) Pilot 1 Recurrent Training will be a Copilot refresher-training course; 2.) Pilot 2 Recurrent Training will be an Aircraft Commander Upgrade training course; 3.) Pilot 3 Recurrent Training will be a currently qualified Aircraft Commander recurrent training course.  Courses are stand-alone in that no contractor, pre-arrival training requirements of the trainee will be allowed.  Courses may be existing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) training courses modified to meet specific requirements delineated herein.  All training courses shall be taught in compliance with the C-40 Model Manager Approved Training Syllabi.  The contractor will be required to submit a training syllabus for each course for government approval.  C-40 training will not result in a FAA check flight or certification.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is  for procurement of SafeNet Luna products on a brand name only basis.  (2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  SafeNet Luna equipment and maintenance for continued use in support of the Department's  PKI program.  (3) A description of the supplies or services required  to meet the agency's needs (including  the estimated value):  The State Department PKI Program uses the SafeNet Luna, plus Luna support equipment, as  the security component of its Entrust based Public Key Infrastructure. Interoperability of the  components is essential to functional system; components not certified by Enturst and  Safenet may prove non-functional in this configuration. At this time, Entrust nor Safenet  cannot guarantee that products purchased from sources other than Safenet will support the  continued operation of the Departments PKI.  (4)  ~n identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open  competition.  IRM/OPS/ITI/SI requires SafeNet Luna products to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 use 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy  agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1  (c), is cited at the statutory authority.  (5) A demonstration  that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of  the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:  Entrust and Safenet will only provide support for products purchased from Entrust or  Safenet. If there are support issues on product not purchased through Entrust or Safenet, they  will defer to the supplier of the product. Maintenance of these products is required to ensure  that any problems with the equipment will be rectified immediately by Entrust and Safenet.  Installation of a different hardware security module may have the following issues:  1.  Non-compliance with DoS approved desktop software configuration, voiding other  warranties associated with the equipment and software.  2.  Interoperabilitycannotbe guaranteed..  3.  Support fro functional enhancements made to the system, as part of the PKI or future  medications cannot be guaranteed to be supported.<BR><BR>(6) A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential  sources as is practicable, including whether a CBD synopsis was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. Attempts were made to gain quotes on the requested items from other vendors. (7) A determination  by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government  will be fair and reasonable.  A price analysis will be conducted to determine if the cost is fair and equitable.  (8) A description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement  of the  reason market research was not conducted.  Safenet is the manufacturer and only provider that can upgrade, update, patch and support  their software, as well as replace defective hardware with equipment with identical technical  specification to those currently installed, Safenet, Inc. is the sole source.  (9) Any other facts supporting  the use of other than full and open competition:  No additional information provided.  (10) A list of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: NA  (ll)A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take t remove or overcome any  barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services  required.  PKIlBLADE is a COTS solution that provides PKI functionality and biometric authentication  to the OpenNet. Even though it is a COTS solution, it is also a proprietary solution. Should  a wider variety of digital encryption services and products become known to IRM/SI, these  products will be considered as potential sources.<BR><BR>

The price of tape drives as now deployed by GITM for this purpose is over $1700 per drive, and GITM deploys one drive for each of three servers plus a spare, at a cost of nearly $7,000 plus the cost of media.  Removable hard drives, on the other hand, consist of a carrier (around $300) and a removable drive (also roughly $300 for the same capacity as tapes).  In the recommended model of making weekly off-site backups (not daily), this reduces the cost significantly, while also greatly improving post's ability to quickly recover files and e-mails from the on-site snapshots. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the Tandberg RDX Removable Hard Drive system as the only one available in the market today that meets the Department's requirements for low cost, capacity, performance, and ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s enterprise backup system.<BR><BR>CHECKING THIS BOX CERTIFIES THAT SELLER UNDERSTANDS AND IS BIDDING PER ALL SPECIFICATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS OUTLINED IN ATTACHED DOCUMENT (1019731874Instructions.doc).  No exceptions.  If you cannot agree to ALL terms and instructions, do not bid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>I.	Introduction
The Office of Workers? Compensation Programs (OWCP) under the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers disability compensation programs that mitigate the impact of work-related injury for certain workers and their families, through the provision of medical treatment and other benefits.
OWCP is seeking a centralized medical bill processing solution for three OWCP programs:  the Division of Federal Employees? Compensation (DFEC), the Division of Coal Mine Workers? Compensation (DCMWC) and the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC).  Each OWCP program has a unique set of processing rules based on legislatively-mandated requirements, and that the CBP solution must allow for all three processes based on these unique rules.  Specifically, payments are only authorized for the medical conditions accepted as being compensable by the OWCP program under which the claim is filed.
The primary goals of the OWCP CBP are to:
?	Ensure a smooth and timely transition from the incumbent service provider.
?	Ensure efficient, accurate and timely processing of bills for compensable medical conditions.
?	Ensure timely and correctly processed authorization for covered benefits.
?	Assure accurate and timely responses to customer inquiries and requests.
?	Incorporate state-of-the-art medical bill processes, including but not limited to, utilization reviews for medical treatments and prescriptions, and fraud and abuse protection programs.
?	Establish a framework for continuous improvement.

This notification is a Request for Information (RFI) from industry vendors regarding their interest, capabilities and recommendations in developing proposals for OWCP?s Central Bill Process.  This RFI is intended to identify potential vendors and to solicit information useful for guidance and preparation of an RFP.
II.	Background
OWCP seeks a contractor to perform medical bill processing operations for the three OWCP programs, to limit payment based on the medical condition being accepted as compensable by the program, to support the prior authorization of services and to respond to inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers.    
CBP operations process medical bills, manage provider enrollment, support the prior authorization of services, and respond to inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers.  In contrast with typical medical bill processing operations, payments are authorized based on the medical conditions (ICD-9 codes) accepted as being compensable by the OWCP program under which the claim is filed.  This is accomplished by applying OWCP?s treatment suites framework to the accepted condition.
In addition to processing bills, the selected contractor shall be responsible for all inquiries regarding bills and appeals, authorization of services, suspense resolution, provider enrollment and appeals processing.  As the contractor is not a fiscal agent, it will send payment files to the Treasury Department for disbursement of checks (the contractor does not disburse payment).  The selected contractor shall interface with the OWCP National Office and District Offices? staff for each program in the performance of these activities.
OWCP?s medical bill processing function is currently being provided as an outsourced service by an incumbent contractor.  As the incumbent is providing an outsourced service, the government does not own an information system that will be transferred to a follow-on contractor.
The estimated annual volumes of bills, authorizations, and inquiries, processed and the providers enrolled for each program are presented below.
   	
 	DFEC;	DCMWC;	DEEOIC;	TOTAL
Line items processed	10,929,598;	495,350;	300,266;	11,725,214
Call center calls processed*	917,794;	42,028;	30,057;	989,879
Authorizations processed	557,758; 	958;	1,714;	560,430
Bill preparation	     4,834,905; 	226,119;	85,612;	5,146,636
Pages imaged	6,557,890;	622,792; 303,490; 7,484,172;
New provider enrollment	 7,270;	1,334;	1,042;	9,646;
* Based on an average call of 4.5 minutes

In 2006, there were approximately 758,291 authenticated hits against the current CBP web portal by claimants, providers and OWCP employees.
Approximately 1,745 internal OWCP users, representing all 3 OWCP Programs, require read only access to the processing system.

The Department wide workers compensation program is centralized and routinely services approximately 30,000 employees from the principal organizational components and offices of the Department.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office is excluded from this centralized program.  During fiscal year 2006, the Department experienced approximately 450 total work-related injuries and illnesses with approximately 230 resulting in lost time. 

This service level undergoes major changes due to the activities of the Bureau of the Census.  Each decennial cycle generates a dramatic increase in workers compensation cases. The Federal workers compensation program covers decennial employees and the Department wide workers compensation program services approximately 900,000 short-term employees for this several month period. This requires scalability in the DOC program to meet the increased cyclical demand.  In addition, the short employment duration necessitates rapid and efficient claims management to ensure employees are returned to work as quickly as medically possible. 
  
Purpose

The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the U.S. Department of Commerce in formulating its requirements and identify businesses, which have the ability to fulfill all of the U.S. Department of Commerce workers compensation program requirements.  

 
DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

All vendors are invited to submit a capability statement related to Federal employee workers compensation claims management.  The capabilities must leverage and partner with the DOC professional workers compensation specialists as well as OWCP staff to address each requirement of the FECA process.  This includes, but is not limited to: 

1.	Primary contact for information and customer service to injured employees and their managers
2.	Primary contact for DOL nurses
3.	Receipt and review of new claims
4.	Timely submission of new claims to OWCP
5.	Case management of new claims
6.	Case management of long-term or periodic roll cases
7.	Provide claims management recommendations (e.g. additional medical review, referral to fraud investigation)
8.	Perform program advisory function to include training of supervisors
9.	Supply claims data management
10.	Report preparation for both DOC and DOL
11.	Contribute to return-to-work activities
12.	Scalability for increased and decreased demand related to decennial census

DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of this request.

DeVenCI will use workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a web portal to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It will also provide timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses, but rather focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed emerging solutions to DoD user needs.

Parties interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. All applications must be received on or before March 7, 2007. Selected companies will be responsible for travel and all other expenses associated with their participation in this workshop.

<SUBJECT>INDUSTRY DAY FOR DIVER HULL IMAGING AND NAVIATION SYSTEMS (DHINS)
<DESC>All interested contractors are invited to attend a Diver Hull Imaging and Navigation System (DHINS) Industry Day with U.S. Navy Fleet and acquisition personnel.  This system will be used to improve the capabilities of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) divers in conducting Navy Fleet Support Operations.  This event will be held on 27 March 2007 at the Navy Memorial in Washington, DC (701 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20004). The yellow and green Metro lines serve the Navy Memorial. Directions to the facility are available upon request.  The objective is to provide an opportunity for early industry involvement in the Government's proposed approach for future low-risk procurement of the DHINS.  DHINS will improve the capability of EOD divers to rapidly reconnoiter ship hull and berthing areas, and to investigate and localize unexploded ordnance (UXO) objects that impose a threat to Joint and Maritime operations.  Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) may also be planned to incorporate system interoperability with Unmanned Underwater VehicleS (UUVs); integration with Expeditionary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (C4I) systems; and to implement connectivity with a Ship Hull database configured for DHINS applications.  DHINS will be composed of a target detection and imaging sensor(s) integrated with a precise navigation sub-system and a voice communication sub-system to enable the accurate detection and mapping of targets that present a potential threat to high value assets.  Top-side display and command and control equipment will complete the system configuration.  The system will be designed such that operation will not inadvertently actuate underwater mines equipped with anti-tampering and/or anti removal features.  Following this Industry Day it is envisioned that a Request For Proposals (RFP) will be issued for a prototype DHINS.  The contracting approach will involve the issue of an RFP, proposal submission by all interested vendors, leading to contract award.  The contract involves delivery of the prototype and documentation followed by an evaluation of the prototype(s).  After an evaluation involving Navy laboratory and Fleet personnel, one or more of the alternate designs will be selected for further acquisition, provided at least one of the alternate designs is found to be operationally suitable and effective. Input received from this Industry Day will facilitate refinement of the competitive acquisition strategy. Industry input is desired to allow for an effective acquisition program with well defined requirements in the Request for Proposal (RFP). Attendance at the Industry Day is not a prerequisite for  ultimately submitting any future proposals. However, it will provide a valuable opportunity for questions & answers and industry input into the read-ahead documentation. Any read ahead documentation will be posted for viewing on or about 16 March 2007. Seating is limited. Request a maximum of two (2) representatives per vendor. Request attendees’ register for the Industry Awareness Day/Risk Mitigation Workshop by providing Company/Organization Name, Name(s) of attendees, Company/Organization affiliation, address, telephone number, and e-mail address not later than 20 March 2007. Registration data must be faxed or e mailed to the Technical POC identified below. Any advance questions and/or comments pertaining to the Industry Day or the read ahead documentation may be faxed or e-mailed to the Technical POC so that they can be addressed at Industry Day. The purpose of this Industry Day is not to obtain proposals and is solely to offer early industry involvement in a contemplated U.S. Navy procurement. The Government does not intend to pay for the information obtained during the workshop or for the time and expense of the industry participants involved, nor is the Government obligated to any future acquisition or procurement action. For questions please contact the Technical POC: John Klose (850) 235 5720, FAX (850) 234-4192, e-mail: john.p.klose@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>A -- Controlling Pathogen Evolution Workshop
<DESC>Special Notice SN07-21:  Controlling Pathogen Evolution; Date: March 27, 2007; Registration Deadline:  March 16, 2007; Technical POC:  Dr. Michael Callahan, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (571) 218-4537 URL: http://safe.sysplan.com/sn07-21


Controlling Pathogen Evolution, SN07-21.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a workshop to discuss techniques to first predict pathogen evolution and then direct it to a less virulent form.  Pathogens, particularly RNA viruses, are well known for the high rate of mutation that enables them to escape primary or secondary immune responses.  Additionally, many viruses undergo recombination events that alter their proteins more dramatically.  This workshop will investigate tools for predicting protective epitopes, pathogen evolution and protein structure, and then review strategies to force pathogens into an evolutionary trap that prevents escape through mutation.  From there, vaccines and therapies can be developed against the particular pathogen strain.  

The workshop will be held at 3811 N.Fairfax Drive, Suite 600, Arlington, VA 22203.  The goal of the workshop is to explore 1) the potential of computational methods to precisely predict pathogen evolution, and 2) vaccination and/or therapeutic strategies to control direction of pathogen evolution.  The workshop will address the development of successful proposals for submission; attendees should have specific expertise in infectious disease, epitope prediction (computational and/or immunomic), vaccinology, mathematical modeling, protein structure, pathogen evolution, drug design, and/or animal modeling.

Workshop participants are strongly encouraged to prepare posters describing previous or potential research in the area in order to facilitate discussions and/or formation of well-rounded teams.  For poster submissions, a detailed description of the poster must be submitted by March 16, 2007, 4pm ET.  A maximum of 20 3ft x 3ft posters can be accommodated.  

There is no fee for any workshop activities.  Details on the workshop, including registration and poster information, can be found here:
http://safe.sysplan.com/sn07-21

Registration is limited by the venue capacity (maximum of 50 people, maximum 2 from each institution).  The registration cutoff date is March 16, 2007, or at attendance capacity whichever comes first.  If there is additional space available after the registration deadline, institutions will be permitted additional participants on a first-come, first-serve basis.  Please refer to the "Controlling Pathogen Evolution Workshop" in correspondence.  This announcement is not a request for proposals.  

Material presented at the workshop, including posters presented at the poster session, DARPA presentations, and any response to clarification inquiries and administrative questions, will also be available by emailing SN07-21@darpa.mil for those interested but unable to attend.

The schedule must be acceptable to the government. &#160;(Pg 24 of RFP) The cost to be spread over 5 years (per your response below).&#160;  Correct The contract is for 1 year with 4 option years.&#160;  The contract is for 5 years. 1 base year with 4 renewable options. There is a possibility that the upgrade could be completed in year 1 and no option years are exercised, hence the contractor would only be compensated for 20% of the actual cost.  This is remote but possible.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 ?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 ?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
 ?Inverted Domestic Corporation.? A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

 (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
 (f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

?Inverted Domestic Corporation.? A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation in accordance with FAR Part 12.  No other solicitation will be issued; proposals are being requested via this notice.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) requires the publication of legal advertisements for the purpose of announcing property seizures.  ATF is mandated by law to publish all property that is seized for forfeiture.  This has been further defined by the Asset Forfeiture Law and Practice Manual as,  ?Notice of the seizure of property and the intent to forfeit must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the proceeding is brought.?    In addition, it has been determined this requirement can be met by publication in a national newspaper that meets certain circulation requirements.  ATF is mandated by Congress to publish all administrative seizures in a newspaper of general circulation in all 92 judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement must be published in a newspaper once a week for three consecutive weeks.  The purpose of these advertisements is to give notice to all interested parties such as a lien holder or other unknown individuals who may have a vested interest in the property.  The contractor shall publish the legal advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation.  That is, a newspaper that publishes news of general interest and character to the public, to include political and business events, circulating among the general public in each of the Federal judicial districts of the United States and its territories.  The advertisement shall include, at a minimum, specific descriptive information regarding the property and its seizure by ATF.  In addition the advertisement will include instructions as to how parties with an interest in the property seized can file a claim to contest the seizure and intended forfeiture of the property.  The boundaries of the following Federal judicial districts correspond to the state or territorial boundaries.  Therefore, circulation figures for these states or territories will demonstrate circulation for the judicial district:  Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Guam.  In the following cases, more than one Federal judicial district is located within a state.  These judicial districts are given, along with the United States Code (U.S.C.) citation, which lists the counties that comprise the district.  Offerors may satisfy that it publishes in substantial quantities in the Federal judicial district, by demonstrating that it sells at least the minimum number of copies in the counties that comprise the district: Alabama, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 81(a); Alabama, Middle -28 U.S.C. 81(b); Alabama, Southern -28 U.S.C. 81 (c); Alaska -28 U.S.C. 81A; Arizona - 28 U.S.C. 82; Arkansas, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 83(a); Arkansas, Western - 28 U.S.C. 83(b); California, Northern -28 U.S.C. 84(a); California, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 84(b); California, Central - 28 U.S.C.  84 (c); California, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 84(d); Colorado - 28 U.S.C. 85; Connecticut - 28 U.S.C. 86; Delaware - 28 U.S.C. 87; District of Columbia - 28 U.S.C 88; Florida, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 89(a); Florida, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 89(b); Florida, Southern -28 U.S.C. 89 (c); Georgia, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 90(a); Georgia, Middle; - 28 U.S.C. 90(b); Georgia, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 90 (c); Hawaii - 28 U.S.C. 91; Idaho - 28 U.S.C. 92; Illinois, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 93(a); Illinois, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 93(b); Illinois, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 93 (c); Indiana, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 94(a); Indiana, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 94(b); Iowa, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 95(a); Iowa, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 95(b); Kansas - 28 U.S. C. 96; Kentucky, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 97(a); Kentucky, Western - 28 U.S.C. 97(b); Louisiana, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 98(a); Louisiana, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 98(a)2; Louisiana, Western - 28 U.S.C. 98(b); Maine - 28 U.S.C. 99; Maryland - 28 U.S.C. 100; Massachusetts - 28 U.S.C. 101; Michigan, Eastern ? 28 U.S.C. 102(a); Michigan, Western - 28 U.S.C. 102(b); Minnesota - 28 U.S.C. 103; Mississippi, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 104(a); Mississippi, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 104(b); Missouri, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 105(a); Missouri, Western - 28 U.S.C.  105(b); Montana - 28 U.S.C. 106; Nebraska - 28 U.S.C. 107; Nevada - 28 U.S.C. 108; New Hampshire - 28 U.S.C. 109; New Jersey - 28 U.S.C. 110; New Mexico - 28 U.S.C. 111; New York, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 112(a); New York, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 112(b); New York, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 112 (c); New York, Western - 28 U.S.C. 112(d); North Carolina, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 113(a); North Carolina, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 113(b); North Carolina, Western - 28 U.S.C. 113(c); North Dakota - 28 U.S.C. 114; Ohio, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 115(a); Ohio, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 115(b); Oklahoma, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 116 (a); Oklahoma, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 116 (b); Oklahoma, Western - 28 U.S.C. 116 (c); Oregon - 28 U.S.C. 117; Pennsylvania, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 118(a); Pennsylvania, Middle - 28 U.S.C.  118(b); Pennsylvania, Western - 28 U.S.C. 118(c); Puerto Rico - 28 U.S.C. 119; Rhode Island - 28 U.S.C. 120; South Carolina - 28 U.S.C. 121; South Dakota - 28 U.S.C. 122; Tennessee, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 123(a); Tennessee, Middle - 28 U.S.C. 123(b); Tennessee, Western - 28 U.S.C. 123(c); Texas, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 124(a); Texas, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 124(b); Texas, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 124(c); Texas, Western - 28 U.S.C. 124(d); Utah - 28 U.S.C. 125; Vermont - 28 U.S.C. 126; Virgin Islands - 28 U.S.C. 118 (a); Virginia, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 127(a); Virginia, Western - 28 U.S.C. 127(b); Washington, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 128(a); Washington, Western - 28 U.S.C. 128(b); West Virginia, Northern - 28 U.S.C. 129(a); West Virginia, Southern - 28 U.S.C. 129(b); Wisconsin, Eastern - 28 U.S.C. 130(a); Wisconsin, Western - 28 U.S.C. 130(b); Wyoming - 28 U.S.C. 131, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

0001	The vendor shall provide a pre-performance materials sample plus one accurately dimensioned oriented graphite truncated cone of specified chemical purity, density, and mosaic distribution. The required physical dimensions and tolerances are provided in drawing 038-0075  rev-3. Material specifications are cited below.  The pre-performance materials sample shall be provided following award of the contract and prior to beginning production of the truncated cone. The sample material shall be provided within one month after Contractor acceptance of the of the purchase order.  

0002	The vendor shall provide a certified material analysis: Materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution in the block as measured through X-ray diffraction.  The pre-performance sample as well as the truncated cone will be tested by the government to ascertain compliance with all specifications.



The materials shall meet the following specifications:

Materials Specifications: 

Chemical composition and Density: This specification ensures sufficient content of the desired oriented graphite majority phase. 
Carbon as Pyrolytic Graphite >99 percent by weight
The overall density of each filter block (volume to be that defined by the corresponding drawings) shall exceed 95 percent of the room temperature density of Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite, which is 2.26g per cm3.
Mosaic distribution: This specification is set to maximize transmission in the 0.23 nm to 0.4 nm wave length range and to maximize efficiency as a filter for higher order neutrons. 
The average c-axis direction for a filter block shall be parallel to the high symmetry axis (the beam direction) of the cone to within 1 degree. 
The average Full Width at Half Maximum Mosaic width for the truncated cone as measured with 14.7 meV neutrons shall not exceed 5 degrees. 
Neutron transmission specification: This specification ensures adequate neutron transmission in the operating energy range. Factors that reduce neutron transmission are neutron absorbing impurities, lattice defects, large mosaic distribution widths, and graphite powder inclusions.
The room temperature transmission of neutrons throughout the energy ranges 2.5 meV to 7 meV and 8 meV to 14.7 meV through 50 mm of the material along the c-axis shall exceed 65 percent.  

Overall Physical Dimensions and Lamination Requirements:

The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish of the truncated cone are specified on the attached drawing.
The truncated cone can be built as a laminated structures detailed by the vendor. If the vendor builds the truncated cone as laminated structures, then it must adhere to the following requirements in order to ensure that the potentially laminated body can be mounted effectively and that there are no open joints along beam axis 
Lamination planes shall be perpendicular to the central axis of the filter.
This requirement is to prevent streaming through cracks in the lamination. The lamination structure shall preclude straight line neutron propagation within 10 degrees of the cylinder axis without passage through at least 35 mm solid graphite. 
If necessary to keep the lamination together, the filter material can be held within a thin 1060 or 5005 aluminum shell with outer dimensions consistent with drawing 038-0075 rev 3. Materials other than graphite and 1060 or 5005 aluminum must be approved by the COTR. 
At least 95 percent of the filter volume defined by drawing 038-0075 rev 3 shall be pyrolytic graphite. The remaining maximum of 5 percent can be lamination voids and material associated with holding the laminations together subject to the limitations mentioned above.

Certified Materials Analysis:

The materials delivered under this order shall be accompanied by a certified materials analysis indicating the graphite and impurity content and the average mosaic distribution in the block as measured through X-ray diffraction. Neutron measurements will be carried out by the government to determine whether the mosaic requirements as stated previously are satisfied. 

Pre-Performance Sample:
 
The selected vendor shall provide a pre-performance materials sample that is representative of the filter material to be delivered so that compliance with specifications can be verified by the Government. The pre-performance sample, which can itself be a laminated structure, shall have a thickness along the c-direction of 50 mm. The dimensions in both orthogonal directions perpendicular to the c-axis shall be between 20 mm and 50 mm. The pre-performance sample shall be provided within 1 month after receipt of the order. 

Government Responsibilities:

The government will perform at least two types of analysis on the pre-performance materials sample and will report the results to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the sample.
Diffraction using 14.7 meV neutrons will be used to determine the mosaic distribution. 
The neutron transmission along the c-axis will be measured as a function of neutron energy. 

Upon vendor request, the government will also carry out such measurements on material intended for inclusion in the product during the production phase. The results of such measurements will be reported to the vendor within 1 month of receiving the material. The total quantity of material to be analyzed in this fashion shall not exceed the total amount of material ordered. 
The Government analysis of material provide by the vendor does not relieve the vendor from their responsibility with respect to meeting the requirements set forth herein.

Acceptance:

A certification of compliance with all specifications from the vendor shall be a condition for acceptance. In addition, one or more of the following acceptance tests may be carried out by the TIC to ensure compliance with specifications: 
Physical inspection to assure that the dimensions and tolerances are consistent with the supplied drawings. 
Measurement of the weight of the truncated cone to determine whether the overall density (with volume as specified by the corresponding drawing) exceeds 95 percent of the density of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. 
Measurement of the overall mosaic distribution of the filter block using 14.7 meV neutrons. 
Neutron diffraction measurements to ensure that the average c-axis direction coincides with the high symmetry axis of the filter block to within 1 degree.
Measurement of the neutron transmission along the c-axis and through 50 mm material for 14.7 meV neutrons. 
The Government intends to carry out the above testing within 1 month of delivery of the truncated cone.

Requirements:

1.0	Introduction
The U.S. Department of Agriculture?s (USDA) National Finance Center (NFC) is located on the Michoud Assembly Facility in eastern New Orleans.  There are approximately 1200 employees at NFC.  Currently, NFC has a small medical office staffed by one Registered Nurse (R.N.).  In the event of a widespread health crisis (pandemic), NFX would need the services of an onsite contract physician.

2.0	Background
For several years, world health and crisis management personnel have been focused on the rapid progression of the Avian Flu (H5N1).  Experts are predicting that there is a good probability that this virus will evolve human-to human transmission capabilities in the coming six-24 months, creating a pandemic.  Such a development has dire projected consequences on people, organizations, communities, and governments.  Predictions for this potential new pandemic have dire forecasts, posing special challenges to many organizations, especially those with mission-critical and essential services, such as NFC.  For this reason, NFC is taking a proactive approach to preparations in the event of a pandemic flu outbreak in the New Orleans area.

3.0	Description of Work
In the event of a pandemic flu outbreak in the New Orleans, area, the contractor shall provide one full-time physician who will provide primary care services to the employees of NFC.  Contractor care shall cover the range of services provided in a similar civilian medical treatment facility.  Performance shall be of a nature and scope to meet or exceed current, recognized standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations for the specialty.  The services to be provided will include, but will not be limited to:

?	Providing a cursory medical inspection for each employee who seeks treatment at the medical office within a reasonable time after their arrival, and a definitive medical examination and health history of the employee in a timely fashion thereafter;
?	Providing diagnosis and treatment of illness and injury;
?	Provision of all necessary referrals for specialists and institutional care and assisting in reviewing follow-up information from such offsite referrals;
?	Issuing and maintaining signed and dated standing orders for medical care in accordance with the law

?	Advising the NFC R.N. of all medical and health related matters, including the furnishing of diagnosis, prognosis, and recommendations for future care;
?	Consulting with the R.N. on ordering, accounting for, and safeguarding health equipment, supplies, and medications.

Under this agreement, the physician is an independent contractor and not an employee of USDA,NFC.  However, the performance of the physician under this contract is subject to day-to-day supervision, clinical oversight and control by the NFC R.N., comparable to that exercised over Federal employees in comparable work.  The physician agrees to provide malpractice insurance to cover his or her professional services to employees.  In addition, the physician agrees to indemnify and hold USDA, NFC harmless from all expenses, including attorney?s fees and claims on account of property or bodily injury (including death) that may be sustained by himself/herself in connection with work performed.

The physician agrees to make no public statements concerning NFC employees or activities without prior written approval of the NFC Director or his designated representative.



4.0	Licensure/Registration
The physician shall have and maintain a valid unrestricted medical license in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shall comply with the licensing requirement applicable in the location where services are to be performed.  The physician shall also have and maintain a current Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration number (certificate).  The physician?s license must correspond to DEA registration number.

The contract physician should possess the following skills and knowledge:

Knowledge of a wide variety of resource agencies available within the community to ensure proper and expedient referral of the patient.

Knowledge of established clinic standards of care and Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) requirements for clinical and documentation protocols, safety, infection control, performance improvement, etc., to ensure compliance wit policies and provide consistent guidance for clinic staff.

Ability to teach patients and/or families proper home health care activities, such as giving injections, taking blood pressure, etc.

6.0	Hours of Performance
 The hours, including weekend and emergency coverage, are to be determined by NFC management, depending upon the needs of the employees.  The Government shall pay only for the actual hours worked.

7.0	Security Requirements
Only U.S. citizens will be allowed to work under this contract.  The contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have physical access to a federally-controlled facility or access to a Federal information system.

2.	Complete a Fair Credit Reporting Release, and two FD-258, Fingerprint Charts.  The Fair Credit Reporting Release is located at:  http://www.usda.gov/da/pdsd/Web-Fair.htm.  The FD-258, Fingerprint Charts, may be obtained by contract companies (not individuals) by faxing a request to U.S. Investigations Services at 724-794-0012, Attn:  Michelle Pennington.  Include the requestor?s name, mailing address, and number of FD-258, Fingerprint Charts requested.  Questions regarding fingerprint charts may be addressed to michelle.pennington@opm.gov.

3.	The contractor?s employee must appear in persona in front of the PIV Sponsor or his or her designee with the completed forms and 2 identity source documents in original form.  The identity source documents must be documents listed as acceptable for establishing identity on Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, List A and B.

After beginning work under the contract, the contractor employee must receive a favorable agency adjudication of the FBI fingerprint and NACI results, or other U.S. Office of Personnel Management or National Security community background investigation.

Should the results of the PIV process require the exclusion of a contractor?s employee, the contracting officer will notify the contractor in writing.  The contractor must appoint a representative to manage this activity and to maintain a list of employees eligible for a USDA PIV ID Badge required for performance of the work.  The responsibility of maintaining a sufficient workforce remains with the contractor.  Employees may be barred by the Government from performance of the work should they be found ineligible or to have lost eligibility for a USDA PIV ID badge.  Failure to maintain a sufficient workforce of employees eligible for a USDA PIV ID badge may be grounds for termination of the contract.  The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have access to a federally-controlled facility or information system.

The PIV Sponsor for this contract is the Contracting Officer Representative (COR), unless otherwise specified in this contract.

In the event that a contractor becomes ineligible to occupy the position, whether this is due to suitability or security issues, it is incumbent upon the contractor?s parent company to provide a replacement that meets all investigative and/or clearance requirements.

Question:  Is the figure of 50,000 lines for each qualified newspaper within the 92 judicial districts capable of delivering the announcements to the target audience, or is the requested cost of 50,000 lines total of all qualified newspapers combined for a single week of advertising?

Answer:  The 50,000 lines is the ATF estimate for a 12 month period for all seized property.

Question:  Based on the answer to the above question, confirm  that when advertisements are distributed to the qualified target newspapers, advertisements will be published at least once weekly for coverage in each of the 92 judicial districts at the same time with the same advertisement? 

Answer:  Yes.  The ad must run once a week for three consecutive weeks.

Question:  Because qualified newspapers are based on a certain number of PAID subscribers receiving the newspapers, does this mean that only one qualified newspaper within the targeted judicial district in which the seizure proceeding is brought can be utilized? 

Answer.  Any qualified newspaper that meets the legal requirement can be used.

Question:  Or can the advertisement be published in more than one (1) qualified newspaper at the same publishing period that might overlap geographical coverage and/or reach of target markets such as a multi-city local newspaper vs competing multi-city local newspaper or multi-city vs a state wide newspaper? 

Answer:  Yes.

ANSWER.Yes, the photographic service provider will provide photos for the bureaus?? and agencies?? websites when requested.

4)	7th bullet re: Administrative functions:  
a.	Please define ??market research?? by providing examples.
ANSWER.Market research involves canvassing various industry publications, periodicals, websites, businesses, corporations and manufacturers for news, information and costs for service or equipment. In regard to locating a photographer in a particular area, region or city, it would involve locating a Professional Photographer's Guild; and, contacting a number of the available Photographers until you have confirmation for your event coverage, delivery and cost. This process can take from several minutes to several days depending on what is needed and the time frame it is needed in.

b.	Re: shared computer library:
i.	Will the shared computer library be a server or disks? 
ANSWER.Both a server and a disk.
ii.	Will the library be hosted and maintained by the government or the PS provider?
ANSWER.The library will be hosted and maintained by the Government. 
iii.	Who will provide hardware and software maintenance/back-up?
ANSWER.All Government furnished property that is currently maintained and backed-up by the Government will continue.  However, all other hardware and software is the responsibility of the provider.?? 

     iv.   How much storage capacity does the government require?
ANSWER.The Government will be responsible for storage capacity.

ANSWER.The Working Capitol Fund is what private interest groups or individuals make their checks payable to when requesting Photographic Services. We do provide services upon request to FTC and FMC. The services are the same as the requesting offices in the Department of Commerce. They range from Official Portraits in the studio and on location, Award Ceremonies, and photojournalism with proofs and enlargements provided upon request.

b.	Will the PS provider continue to provide services to non-government private interest groups such as the Credit Union and National Marine Science Foundation?

ANSWER.Yes, they will continue to provide services.

6)	How will photographic services be billed/payment for services be processed?

Performance Requirements
9)	3rd bullet re: photographs for the website:

ANSWER.Yes, this is reflected in the Final Performance Work Statement.

ANSWER.The customer will determine which photographs will be posted to the website.  The photographic service provider will be advised of this when requesting the service.

10)	4th bullet re: All other photographs provided within 8 business hours of completion of assignment.  
a.	Some assignments may be completed on weekends and late in the evening, and some assignments may be very lengthy and cover several days. The longer the assignment, the greater the number of photographs.   In addition, industry best practices provide for color correction, red eye reduction, cropping, eye opening, and general cleaning up of photographs in preparing a proof CD for the customer, which takes time.  For enlargements (prints), commercial services charge 200% mark-up for same day services; 100% for next day services, and require 3-5 business days for standard turn-around services.  Will the government consider a 3-5 business day turnaround for standard orders, unless the customer specifies faster turnaround and understands the additional cost to the customer? 
ANSWER.Yes, the Government will consider 3-5 day turnaround for standard orders, unless the customer specifies a faster turnaround time. 
b.	Please define ??all other forms of photographs.?? Does this refer to proof CDs, or enlargements (prints)?  Does this mean photographs that are not for the website, and if so, what types of photographs does the government anticipate this would be (e.g. certain portraits, certain types of events, etc.)?
ANSWER.Proofs, enlargement, portraits, and CDs. 

11)	5th bullet re: quality. Is the photographer responsible for ensuring proper protocol, such as the relationship of the flag to the subject ?V or is this a customer responsibility?
ANSWER.The PS provider shall provide all photographic work to the customer as requested by the customer with an electronic copy to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.
12)	Currently, the NAICS Code is: 921190 ?V Other General Government Support.  Wouldn??t it be more appropriate listed under NAICS Code 541922 ?V Commercial Photography?
ANSWER.Yes, the NAICS Code has been changed from 921190 ?V Other General Government Support to reflect the more appropriate NAICS Code 541922 ?V Commercial Photography.
13)	Rather than a ??Total Small Business Set-Aside??, could a set-aside for ??Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business?? be of more value to the Department of Commerce??s SDVOSB goal?
ANSWER.After careful consideration and further research, the Department of Commerce has determined to remain with a ??Total Small Business Set-Aside??.  
14)	Since employees of a winning-contractor would be subject to the DOL Service Contract Act, which of course directly affects the dollar amount of our bid, could the final solicitation include the GS grades of the 4 incumbents?
ANSWER.The GS grades will not be reflected in the posted solicitation.  
15)	Will the Solicitation include a clause that Incumbent employees have the right of first refusal?
ANSWER.Yes, the clause is, and will be inserted into the Solicitation that Incumbent employees will have the right of first refusal.

?X	Switching out/additions to Photo Displays:  Normally, the exhibit in the Secretary??s Diplomatic Reception Area would be updated approximately every other month, switching out photos for more prominent ones as the Secretary??s tenure transpires.  MBDA typically updates their exhibit once a year following MED Week, switching out photos with more prominent up to date enlargements.  The exhibit in the 5400 corridor is usually updated with the change in administration.

The new department heads generally want their agency to reflect the most recent changes made.  ITA has several exhibit areas and conference rooms.  Their selection tends to be of images that are timeless and are of historical nature, so that they do not have to change when the administration changes.  BIS is similar to ITA, but their people and subject matter does not change.

?X	Research support for periodicals/publications:  Once a quarter.  Market research support can take from several minutes to several days depending on what is needed and the timeframe it is needed in.


REPRESENTATIVES   The Department of Commerce Competitive Sourcing Official is Mr. Otto Wolf, Chief Financial Officer. The Agency Tender Official is Mr. Ronald Bell.

<DESC>This is amendment 0001 to solicitation W9114F-07-R-0009.  The following are questions and answers received from prospective vendors.  Closing date remains unchanged. Question 1:  Can we quote equipment only, without installation? Answer:  The requirement is for equipment and installation.  It is your companys decision should you chose to only quote for partial of the requirement. Question 2:  We would like to provide a quotation for comparable/equal equipment to that listed in this solicitation.  I wanted to first make sure that an equal product is acceptable. Answer:  Requirement is for the product stated or equal.  Evaluation of offers will commence once the solicitation is closed.   Question 3:  Is it possible to install both clinics at the same time or does the Vilseck clinic have to be installed 30 post award and the Grafenwoehr clinic in June.   Answer:  Installation of equipment can be at the same time preferably 30 days after award due to the fact that the Vilseck office requires the equipment as soon as possible.
