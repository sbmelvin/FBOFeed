<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

4.2.3 Sampling Plan (Type II). One sample shall be taken from each lot.
4.2.3.1 Lot. A lot shall consist of one of the following:
a. The helium produced in not more than 24 consecutive hours from a
continuous process which is used to fill shipping containers directly from the
process output. A continuous process shall be the production of product by
continuous input of raw materials and output of finished product by one
manufacturer in one plant with no change in manufacturing conditions or
materials.
b. The helium from individual runs of a batch process which is used to
fill shipping containers directly from the process output. A batch process
shall be the production of product by runs from single additions of raw
materials which are reacted and purified forming the product.
c. The helium from either or both the continuous and batch processes
which is held in a single storage tank and subsequently withdrawn to fill
shipping containers. The product shall be homogeneous at the time of
withdrawal and shall not be added to while being withdrawn. After each
addition to the storage tank, the contents shall constitute a separate lot.
4.2.4 Sample. Each sample shall be of sufficient size to conduct all
the quality conformance tests as specified herein. Unless otherwise
specified, the quality conformance tests shall be made of each required sample
(6.2). When required, an equivalent sample shall be forwarded to a laboratory
designated by the procuring activity for testing.
4.3 Rejection. When any sample tested in accordance with 4.4 or 4.5
fails to conform to the requirements specified herein, the entire lot
represented by the sample shall be rejected. Unless otherwise specified,

disposition of rejected product shall be specified by the procuring activity
(6.2).
4.4 Analytical procedures (Type I). Unless otherwise specified, samples
shall be analyzed according to the procedures described below (6.2).
Calibration gas standards may be required to calibrate (zero and span)
analytical instruments used to determine the purity and impurity contents of
the helium. The accuracy of the calibration gas standards is to be traceable
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
4.4.1 Purity. The helium percent shall be found by determining the
aggregate impurities by the methods of CGA G-9.1. The percent helium is the
value obtained when this amount expressed as volume percent is subtracted from
100.
4.4.2 Gaseous impurities. Methods shall be selected from those of CGA
G-9.1.
4.5 Helium assurance test (Type II). Liquid helium is generally assumed
to be extremely pure because contaminants have been removed during the early
stages of the liquefaction process which occurs at 4.2?K (-268.9?C). It
follows that assuring that the fluid is helium is sufficient to verify a
contaminant free product. The requirement for ensuring that the loaded fluid
is liquid helium can be satisfied by
a. Analyzing the vent gas from one of the shipping containers or the
storage tank from which the shipping containers are filled (thermal
conductivity, mass spectrometer, etc); or
b. Demonstrating that the fluid in one of the shipping containers or the
storage tank from which the shipping containers are filled is below the
hydrogen triple point (13.8?K).
4.6 Containers of Type I helium.
4.6.1 Filling pressure. Samples shall be tested for proper filling
pressure by attaching a calibrated Bourdon-tube gauge or equivalent to the
valve outlet and by attaching either a thermocouple or thermometer to the
container wall. The gauge shall have scale divisions not greater than 100 kPa
(15 psi). If a thermometer is used, tape or putty shall be applied to the
bulb to protect it from extraneous temperatures. Putty shall not be applied
between the bulb and the cylinder wall. The thermometer shall have scale
divisions not greater than 1?C (2?F). The containers shall be stabilized to
ambient temperature. Then the valve shall be opened and the internal pressure
observed on the gauge.
4.6.2 Leakage. Each Type I helium container shall be tested for leaks
at the neck threads, stem packing, and safety device of the valve with leakdetection
fluid. Valve seat leakage shall be tested by means of a tube from
the valve outlet to a container of liquid.
5. PACKAGING
5.1 Packaging. For acquisition purposes, the packaging requirements
shall be as specified in the contract or order (see 6.2). When actual
