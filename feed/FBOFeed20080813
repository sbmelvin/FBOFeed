Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 

(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

FOB; Destination, -Accountable Property Officer, Building 5464, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway Utah, 84022,<BR><BR>(APR 2004) (a) This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103. An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed. A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA. (b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract. (4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). (1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay override. (2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies. (3) The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program. Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice. The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action. (d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201. (e) For the purpose of filing an ELAP protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. The ACA Chief Counsel is the ELAP Protest Decision Authority. (f) An ELAP protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an ACA Executive-Level Agency Protest. (g) Executive-Level Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from :Mr Vokt, Eric S.(Contracting Officer),( DIRECTOR OF CONTRACTING- DUGWAY, UT 84022) .

<DESC>DSCR intends to award one indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract to Eagle Picher Industries through the Canadian Commercial Corporation, CAGE 98247, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(3). Based on experience during Operation Iraqi Freedom and studies conducted by DOD, industrial capacity for lithium batteries is insufficient to meet surge, contingency, or wartime needs. The contract will not exceed five years and will include support for two lithium battery NSNs: 6135-01-438-9450, Battery, Nonrechargable, Lithium Sulfur Dioxide, and 6135-01-523-3037, Battery, Nonrechargable. Support includes prepositioned long lead-time materials and government furnished property, and low rate production of both NSNs. The contract may also include financial assistance in moving existing battery production facilities to a location in the United States. Eagle Picher and Saft America are the only known manufacturers of these batteries with a demonstrated capability to meet the government’s needs. No solicitation will be issued; however, any firm that believes it is capable of manufacturing these batteries at the volume and reliability required may request a copy of the statement of need. Award will not be delayed pending consideration of other manufacturing sources.

Each workstation is configured with the DS security template that requires the workstation to crash if the audit logs become full. Event Archiver ensures that workstations remain operations 24x7 by automatically archiving the logs and clearing the logs from the workstation before it reaches capacity. It also alerts the system manager if any suspicious or malicious activity has penetrated any of the systems within the network. Failure to maintain service would likely lead to an interruption in daily operations, resulting to harm to the Government.Purchase of this support will allow RM/GFS, Charleston, SC to maintain its mission critical service which is vital for the proper execution of RM/GFSs responsibility to the financial community. The purchase of additional licenses and support are essential to maintain the operational effectiveness of RM/GFS employees and contractors.Period of Performance: September 1, 2008- August 31, 2009.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole-source, follow-on contract with Defense Group Inc. (DGI) for crisis negotiation tools and support services.  The requirements include, but are not limited to, the purchase of CoBRA® hardware; software; development and support services; maintenance; and training in order to further develop and deploy the systems to field crisis negotiators.   The services to be performed require persons with a unique set of expertise, management, responsiveness, and knowledge of the project.  DGI has seven years experience of providing CoBRA® systems and solutions to the FBI.  The CoBRA® system and associated software is a proprietary product of DGI. In Fiscal Year 2006, the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) acquired the services of DGI for a pilot project to custom-build tools for crisis negotiation applications and integrate the tools seamlessly with the DGI CoBRA® system. The contract resulting from this announcement will be a follow-on to the pilot project with DGI and will result in the national deployment of the tools.  DGI has knowledge of the project since the project inception and has retained all personnel who have worked on the project.  The contract will be for a base year with four additional one-year options.  Due to the inability to identify all of the requirements for the entire contract period, the contract will be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract and will be based on task orders.  Vendors able to meet this requirement are invited to identify their interest and capability by submitting a proposal to include technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information which shows a bona fide ability to meet this requirement within 45 days of this publication.  If no affirmative responses are received within this time to determine that a comparable source more advantageous to the Government is available, negotiations will take place with DGI on a sole-source basis.  No solicitation documents are available.  This notice is published for informational purposes only.

surveys and to genotype the samples from the NCHS&rsquo;s National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES).<span>&nbsp; </span>Along with
genetic data from NCI case control studies that use complex samples, standard
genetic statistical analyses require modification in order to take account of
the sample weighting and complex samples designs used by these surveys and
case-control studies. This project is designed to expand a wide range of
statistical methods to properly analyze cross-sectional, case-control and
cohort studies with complex samples.<span>&nbsp; </span>In
addition this project will put into practice these methods to analyze range of
epidemiologic studies of with complex sample design that will be applied to the
collaborative analysis of the Kidney Cancer Case-control Study and the Karposi

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The
contractor shall develop methods for efficiently analyzing case-control studies
where the controls and the cases are from weighted samples and the controls may
also be a stratified cluster sample. These methods will involve modifications
for complex samples of logistic regression analysis of case case-control
studies and modification of gene by environment interaction analyses based on
the assumption of gene and environment independence. These methods will be

Kits from Illumina, Inc.; 9885
  Towne Centre Drive; San Diego, CA 92121. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This acquisition will be processed
in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Genetics Branch of the
Center for Cancer Research at the NCI is engaged in the study of cancer
genetics. Analysis of genetic alteration is an integral technique to the
function of the Genetics Branch. By using Genotyping BeadChip arrays to analyze
copy number alteration, the NCI is able to investigate the role that specific
genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer
progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples. The single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (SNP) Genotyping BeadChip arrays consist of 50-mer oligos
immobilized on microbeads embedded in an array format. They are manufactured on
custom slides and contain &gt;370,000 target loci. The proposed microarrays
will be analyzed and scanned on the NCI&rsquo;s existing Illumina BeadChip scanner. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Methylation Goldengate
Assay Kits are an advanced development in microarrays. They consist of
microscope slides embedded with almost 1 million microscopic beads, which are
coated with target sequences for genes. Each slide contains 8 of these embedded
micro-bead arrays that allow 8 microarray experiments to be performed
consecutively on the same slides.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MessageHeaderLabel"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-transform: none; font-weight: normal;"><span>&nbsp;</span>The Illumina Methylation Goldengate Assay Kits
are an advanced approach to addressing reproducibility and quality issues in
microarray data. Because of the unique approach of using micro-beads as
microarray targets, it is possible to hybridize to 30-40 replicate targets. (in
our in-house printed slides we are currently hybridizing to only a single
target). By hybridizing to replicate targets, we can average data, which will
provide reproducibility and quality never before possible. Further, due to the
high density of the micro-beads, whole genome arrays are not possible on a
single slide. In fact, multiple arrays (8) are manufactured on a single slide
allowing multiple consecutive experiments to be performed, reducing labor and
reagent costs. These Genome Typing kits are unique and have no competitive
source. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MessageHeaderLabel"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-transform: none; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="MessageHeaderLabel"><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-transform: none; font-weight: normal;">Illumina
is the sole source offering Methylation Goldengate Assay Kits embedded in an
array format that are scannable on the NCI&rsquo;s current BeadArray scanner. They
are manufactured on custom slides and contain &gt;3 target loci. Each oligo on
the beadchip is present at a 30-fold redundancy for a statistically powerful
result unavailable from any other manufacturer. The SNP Genotyping Beadchip
arrays allow analysis of both whole genomic copy number alterations and loss of
heterozygosity in the same analysis. Illumina&rsquo;s assay kits/beadchip arrays are
the only arrays, which are quality controlled at the manufacturer through a
process of iterative hybridization. Because of this, Illumina is the only known
source to the NCI who can provide the items requested.</span></span></p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Clinical Molecular Profiling Core and installation (CMPC) plans to procure as a sole source the brand QIAcube and QIAxcel Instruments with Qiagen Inc.; 27220 Turnberry Ln., Suite 200; Valencia, California 91355-1005.

The supplies are herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

Part I.  Background Information and Description of Acquisition:

The Clinical Molecular Profiling Core (CMPC) will develop and implement state of the art genomic technologies thereby maximizing the clinical benefits and biological insights derived from the analysis of biospecimens obtained from the NCI clinical trials. The purchase of the QIAcube and QIAxcel instruments will allow CMPC to employ state of the art technology for the processing and analysis of human subject’s specimens derived from these trials for specific downstream nucleic acids applications. Specifically, the QIAcube is an automated mechanism for increased throughput of patient specimen processing for the purification of DNA, RNA, and proteins. The QIAxcel system enables fully automated high resolution capillary electrophoresis for up to 96 samples per run allowing for high throughput quality control analyses of extracted DNA, RNA and PCR products. 

	Part II.   Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition:

Statute:  This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41   U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) 	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy agency need.   


The QIAcube is designed to perform fully automated purification of nucleic acids and proteins of up to 12 samples per run for use in molecular biology applications. The QIAcube uses proven QIAGEN® spin-column technology currently employed in the CMPC and is the only known robotic instrument to do so. Uniquely, the instrument controls integrated components including a centrifuge, heated shaker, pipetting system, and robotic gripper minimizing technician hands-on time and creating an efficient workflow for core specimen processing. The CMPC will be CLIA certified and the fact that accessories fit on the worktable only in the correct orientation is critical for the quality measures the core needs to take. 
The QIAxcel system enables fully automated and sensitive, high-resolution capillary electrophoresis for up to 96 samples per run. The high through put enables the CMPC to quickly and accurately obtain quality control measures for extracted DNA and RNA.  The ready-to-run gel cartridges contain 12 separation micro-channels with a built-in gel matrix for fast, high-resolution of DNA fragments or RNA separation.  No other source is known to the NCI that can perform the operations of the QIAcube and the QIAxcel, especially at the cost quoted by the vendor and with the small space saving footprints of these instruments.

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet these requirements. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 a.m. ET on August 28, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Malinda Holdcraft: holdcram@exchange.nih.gov. It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-80177-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) to procure professional support services on a sole source basis from Susie W. Jeffrey, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The purpose of this procurement is to provide maintenance programming support for the SSEUS wide-area update system.  The Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) at the National Library of Medicine requires the services of Ms. Susan Jeffrey of Jeffrey Systems to provide specialized services on the SSEUS maintenance and updating.  

This acquisition will be procured pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 – Acquisition for Non-Commercial Items.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541511 and the business size standard is $23.0.  This is a 100% small business set-aside.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about September 1, 2008.  The period of performance will be for one year from date of award, with four (4) one-year options.  The place of performance will include NIH and offsite (including contractor facility). 

BACKGROUND

The SSEUS software system is a multi-targeted, wide-area, Internet-based update system used by the Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of the National Library of Medicine for editing and emending TOXNET and other related biomedical and toxicological databases. SSEUS permits the updating of data on MySQL and other ODBC-compliant relational database systems by file builders and SIS staff working from a variety of Microsoft Windows, Sun Solaris, and Linux computers connected to the Internet. The core software is written in the UNICON programming language.

The SSEUS suite of programs manages the transformation, formatting, importing, editing, and exporting of data and databases from continually evolving, externally provided sources. These data are critical elements of SIS's Toxicology and Environmental Health program; they are designed for the use of toxicologists, hazardous substance responders, and chemical-based scientific and medical research. SSEUS provides a system for reviewing and editing these data and for exporting the results according to multiple print and database formats.

The software underlying SSEUS includes UNICON, MyODBC, OpenSSH, MySQL, C, SPITBOL, and standard UNIX and Microsoft utilities. SSEUS has both interactive and automated batch components.

TASKS: 
 
The vendor shall: (1) provide maintenance programming support for the SSEUS wide-area update system, modify modules so as to accommodate the changing characteristics of data sources, and to restructure presentations to the databases on-line to be included in the SSEUS system; (2)  respond to problems encountered by users of the SSEUS system by making corrections to the SSEUS source code, by providing documentation, and by consulting with users and SIS staff; (3) be available for prompt response to emergency problems on an as-needed basis; (4) be available for one to two weeks a year on site in order to assist SIS programming staff in the on-going modification and design of the SSEUS system; (5) create programming guides and user documentation as requested by the COTR; (6) show familiarity with the structure and update practices of HSDB, DART, CCRIS, and Gene-Tox databases; (7)  undertake modification and extension of the minor database version of SSEUS to generalize its support for ad hoc inspection and manipulation of occasional databases; (8) provide support for Scientific Review Panel members. This includes system installation and configuration, modification of data fielding, printing support, data import and export, and documentation; and (9) provide programming and procedural documentation for SIS programmers working on the SSEUS system; (10) submit monthly invoices.  

Travel to and from NLM is anticipated during period of performance.

The government shall provide the contractor access to relevant SIS database information and interface requirements.

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, Susan Jeffrey is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  Susan Jeffery of Jeffery Systems is the creator and maintainer of key code developed by her to support SIS's Scientific Review Panel.

<DESC>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, and equipment as needed to replace roofing on historic structures located within Point Reyes National Seashore (PRNS), Marin County, CA.  Work will include the removal and disposal of existing wood shingles and flashing from the D-Ranch Hay Barn.  The PRNS Historic Preservation Crew (HPC) will make necessary repairs to the rafters and sheathing and the contractor will follow and install new cedar shingles, copper flashing and ridge boards. This roof is being reroofed one half at a time (one half of the roof (East Side) was replaced last year).  This project replaces the remaining half of the roof (West Side).  The D-Ranch roof is approx 4,000 SF and the reveal on the shingles is 4-1/2".  Two other structures, the Home Ranch Wood Shed (approx 455 SF), Home Ranch Pig Barn (approx 1,302 SF), and Home Ranch Granary (approx 740 SF) will require removal and disposal of corrugated metal roofing.  The PRNS HPC will make necessary repairs to the rafters and nailers and the contractor will follow with installation of new corrugated metal roofing upon completion. The project range is estimated between $25K-$100K.  Project work can begin upon receipt of a Notice to Proceed and is expected to be completed within 6 months thereafter.  Award selection will be based on a best value determination after considering cost and factors other than cost, such as the contractor's experience installing cedar shingle and/or corrugated metal roofing on buildings listed on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.  The Request for Quotations will be made available for electronic commerce only and can be accessed on/after August 15, 2008 at http://www.fbo.gov or directly through the DOI National Business Center site at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

<DESC>This procurement is for a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order under FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The set-aside for small business concerns has been dissolved. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330.
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD), Resistance and Propulsion Division, Code 5800, and the Computational Hydromechanics Division, Code 5700 have a requirement for engineering and technical support to: a) characterize and model breaking waves and breaking wave impacts using a variety of experimental and computational tools, including Numerical Flow Analysis (NFA), and b) adapt the CFD tool, Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP), for parallel execution including clusters with massively parallel processors and workstations with multi-core processors, and support science and technology advancements associated with acquiring test data and developing computational simulations of this data.  This work includes test planning, testing, computational tool development, data analysis, and overall project management. 
The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to The Naval Hydrodynamics Division of Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). SAIC has provided support of this type to the US Navy and to NSWCCD previously and have experience and necessary simulation tools to address this problem including sea state modeling, vessel dynamics, and the development and application of numerical simulation.  The NFA and LAMP software are proprietary, and SAIC is the only known source.  Alternate use of other programs would jeopardize ship operational safety, and would cost additional time and money in development, validation, and verification.
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 28 August 2008, at 5:00pm will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capabilities statements to Heather Valiga by e-mail at heather.valiga@navy.mil or by fax at (301) 227-3476 on or before 08/28/2008.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Carderock Division, (NSWCCD) currently maintains a Multi-function RADIAC Training Device (MFRTD) to provide Navy personnel the necessary training in meeting the requirements of the Radiological Control Manual for the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program which requires all radiological control technicians receive training for the Multi-Function RADIAC among other important radiation safety issues. NSWCCD has a need for additional accessories for the MFRTD and intends to negotiate a non-competitive procurement with Radiation Safety & Control Services, Inc. The accessories to be purchased include the Phase I DT-681 Alpha probe, Phase II DT-681 Alpha probe, Phase I DT-685 Beta interface with DT-304 Beta frisker, Phase II DT-685 Beta interface with DT-304 Beta frisker and hard-shell protective cases, with an estimated total cost of $2,552,410.Radiation Safety & Control Services, Inc., is the original manufacturer of this equipment. It is the only company that presently has an integral knowledge of the product and system. Radiation Safety & Control Services, Inc. has introduced into the instruments the highly realistic and proven proximity sensing technology that is currently being used in the DT-680 Beta/Gamma probe. This technology is unique to Radiation Safety & Control Services, Inc. simulator devices and Radiation Safety & Control Services, Inc. is actively pursuing a patent for this technology. Award to a source other than Radiation Safety and Control Services, Inc. would significantly increase the cost to the Navy by requiring that another source acquire an integral knowledge of the equipment. Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii), these highly specialized purchases of frisker simulator probes and Alpha simulator probes are available only from the original source, Radiation Safety & Control Services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and (b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources submitting offers will be considered. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties may forward their capability statements to the Government point of contact on or before 28 August 2008. See note 22.

6. Opportunity Description 
6.1 Background 
The US Government has a long history and extensive network of international collaboration and partnerships in the fight against HIV/AIDS, providing funding, technical assistance, and program support.  These collaborations increase the fundamental understanding of HIV transmission and provide an evaluative basis for prevention and intervention success.  The current HIV/AIDS epidemic is devastating.  Militaries, in particular, have been identified as a high-risk population.  In order to target this population, the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), San Diego, California, under the oversight of the Navy Surgeon General, has been tasked to serve as the US Department of Defense (DoD) Executive Agent for the DoD HIV/AIDS Prevention Program (DHAPP).
DHAPP has successfully engaged over 70 countries in efforts to combat HIV/AIDS among their respective military services.  DHAPP is a partner U. S. Government (USG) organization collaborating with the US State Department, Health and Human Services, US Agency for International Development, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).  DoD representatives participate in PEPFAR country teams, core teams and technical working groups to help formulate the Country Operational Plans (COP) in the assault against HIV.  Working closely with US Department of Defense, US Unified Combatant Commanders, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, university collaborators, and other nongovernmental organizations, DHAPP assists countries in establishing HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs and/or strengthening their capabilities to combat HIV.  
DHAPP's goal is to maximize program impact by focusing on the drivers of the epidemic specific to the military and support them in the development of interventions and implementing programs that address theses issues.  DHAPP works with countries militaries to devise plans based on the following process:
	Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs. 	Adapt DHAPP support to a countrys need for prevention, care and/or treatment of their HIV/AIDS situation based on an assessment of the countrys epidemic, and more specifically, in that countrys military. 	Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term. 	Consider program design by leveraging assets with other country partners who have/had successful prevention, care, or treatment efforts. 	Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans. 	Implement and monitor programs to ensure accountability and sustainability. 
Countries and their militaries need strong programs with courses of action that demonstrate: 
	Visible support from the military sector 	Development of plans of action and policies 	Alignment with PEPFAR strategies and priorities.	Increasing awareness within the military sector. 	Country military ownership of its activities. 	Prevention plans focusing on prevention of sexual transmission through voluntary counseling and testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and management, behavioral interventions, reduction of concurrent partnerships, prevention and care of other opportunistic infections, male circumcision, changing male normative behaviors, and prevention campaigns. 	Reduction of mother-to-child transmission, (The primary focus of these interventions is on behavior change to reduce the risks of sexual transmission, counseling, testing, diagnosis and proper linkages to treatment.	Stigma reduction associated with HIV infection. 	Surveillance and infrastructure development through programs focusing on HIV/STI/tuberculosis surveillance, prevalence surveys, laboratory support, monitoring and evaluation, training and strategic information management.	Increasing financial resources 
More information about countries in which DHAPP currently operates and existing DHAPP programs can be found on the DHAPP website, http://www.nhrc.navy.mil/programs/dhapp/index.html .
6.2 Program Purpose and Plan
DHAPP continues to rely upon the vital support of various partners, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in implementing HIV prevention, care and treatment programs across the globe.  Each country has a customized plan to help the countries militaries bring its HIV/AIDS programs to sufficient scale to help reduce the spread of the epidemic and mitigate its impact. 
DHAPPs current priority activities include the following:
-	Training of master trainers and peer educators.-	Troop Level HIV/AIDS prevention education and behavior change communication.-	Providing infrastructure and equipment for HIV testing, care and/or treatment centers.-	Increasing testing of all military personnel. -	Developing HIV laboratory diagnostic and monitoring capabilities.-	Increasing clinical capability for health care of those infected with HIV.-    Effective methodology for monitoring and evaluation procedures.
This BAA is intended to solicit existing partners and establish new partners in order to expand the DHAPP/PEPFAR program.  Interested sources should submit proposals identifying their plans and capabilities per information in Section IV, Application and Submission information.  
Proposals should focus on rapidly extending HIV/AIDS services.  Respondents are encouraged to target specific needs with a practical business plan, using small grass-roots organizations to provide community-based services as a way to enhance organic capabilities and sustainability.
6.3 Sources of Funding
Funding for this BAA comes from either of two sources.  One is the Department of States Global AIDS Program (O/GAC) to implement the PEPFAR.  The overall program manager for this is the Department of States Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (O/GAC), with DHAPP supplying intermediate support for military-specific programs.  Country programs supported by PEPFAR funds can be found on the O/GAC website: http://www.state.gov/s/gac/.  PEPFAR funds require additional certifications as identified on page 3 of Attachment 1.  Funding for the DHAPP program supporting this BAA stems from the Defense Health Program.  Funds are specifically appropriated each year in the Defense budget for HIV prevention programs in foreign militaries, particularly Africa.  DHAPP serves as the overall program manager for this funding.
Respondents should be aware that this BAA covers both programs.  The respondents proposals will be reviewed for the funding source available to that specific countrys military.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with Innovation Data Processing, 275 Paterson Avenue Little Falls, New Jersey 07424, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” to purchase Fast Dump Restore Move software.  SSA requires Fast Dump Restore (FDR)-Move to provide a non-disruptive means to move individual data sets without interruption to online systems.   The pre-requisites for FDR - Move: FDR and FDR Plug And Swap (PAS),  have already been purchased and are currently in use.   This is a crucial part of the Integration Technology Operation Assessment (ITOA) planning timeline. The end result will ensure the accurate transfer of data from the NCC to the DSC and the Integration Document Management Facility (IDMF), Document Management Facility (DMF), and then the Software Engineer Facility (SEF) complexes at the DSC.  The alternative to not acquiring this technology expediently will delay the relocating of the IDMF, DMF, and SEF to the DSC and result in not meeting SSA's ITOA timeline goals. Innovation Data Processing has no authorized resellers of this product, or installation services. The anticipated Contract Line Item is as follows:

Line Item 001 – Fast Dump Restore Move Software one (1) ea.

Innovation Data Processing is the only authorized dealer of this software and its maintenance known to the Government. The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill this requirement. A solicitation is NOT available. Therefore, written and/or verbal requests for copies of a solicitation related to this announcement will not be honored. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If you have any questions regarding this announcement, please contact the POC identified above.

<DESC>       The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Claritas, Inc, 5375 Mira Sorrento PL, STE 400, San Diego, CA 92121-3809. This negotiation is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements,” for continued usage of iMark Software. The required software includes maintenance support and upgrades for the Government-owned iMark Online and iMark Desktop software products. 
       
       Claritas iMark Online, a remotely hosted web application, provides demographic information (Census 2000, current year estimates, and 5 year projections) and mapping capability tailored to SSA's DOORS (Detailed Office/Organization Resource System) field office structure. It also provides SSA the ability to market SSA’s website to increase awareness and use of online services and provides tools and marketing services to increase employees’ effectiveness as communicators. Claritas iMark Desktop provides SSA with Geospatial reporting capability. Further, this software provides SSA executives and managers with a reporting dimension that allows them to view geographic information. This information is in turn integrated with demographic and/or workload data.
       
       This procurement will be accomplished in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5 as applicable. This acquisition will be processed under the simplified acquisition procedures. The NAICS code for this procurement is 811212, and the small business size standard is $23 Million. Further, the contract will have one base year and four option years beginning October 1,2008. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurement. Any vendor capable of performing the preceding requirements must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by close of business August 22, 2008. The evidence must include a discussion of how the software would satisfy the proposed requirements, contact information for no more than three (3) customer references, and associated GSA Schedule or commercial price information on the software and support. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender. All responses must be sent to traci.leach@ssa.gov by Friday August, 22, 2008, 12:00 p.m. EST.

This notice is merely a PRE-Solicitation Notice.   (A SOLICITATION for this procurement will be published HEREAFTER, in this same FedBizOpps website.)  This procurement is a competitive 8(a) set-aside, meaning that each offeror must be certified, by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as an 8(a) firm.   In addition, each offeror must be eligible to perform work under the size-standard associated with North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611.  The incumbent contractor is MacroSys Research and Technology, whose offices are located  at Suite 312, 888  17th Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. 20006.  However, the Statement of Work for this new procurement does differ substantially from the Statements of Work appearing in MacroSys’ incumbent contract documents, so the incumbent contract documents would not be of any help to offerors competing under this new procurement.  MacroSys is eligible to compete under this new procurement.  The information set forth in this Synopsis is ALL of the information that DOT plans to release concerning this new procurement, until DOT hereafter publishes this procurement’s Solicitation in FedBizOpps.  Therefore, please HOLD YOUR QUESTIONS until after you have carefully studied the forthcoming Solicitation for this new procurement.  The due date shown above is only an ESTIMATED due date for DOT’s receipt of proposals.  The ACTUAL due date for proposals will be specified in the SOLICITATION hereafter published in this FedBizOpps website.

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) anticipates an award of one or more Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contracts from this new  procurement.   It is anticipated that each resulting contract will have one Base Year and four Option Years.  Under each resulting  contract, any particular Task Order might be fixed-price, or cost-plus-fixed-fee, or labor-hour, or time-and-materials—or might have some other reimbursement structure.  

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that under each contract resulting from this procurement, some or all of the following types of contractor support services MAY be rendered to DOT’s Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA):  Database Development, Maintenance, and Support;  Economics and Statistical Analysis Technical Support;  Freight Transportation Technical Support;  Global Trade, Logistics, and Intermodal Transportation Research, Studies, and Support;  U.S. Domestic and International Data Processing;  Data Quality Management, Collection, Maintenance, Analysis, and Support;  Outreach and Education Support; Program/Project Management; Survey Review, Analysis, Research, and Data Processing; and Transportation Analysis and Research Support (multi-modal). 

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that the following labor categories (job titles) MAY need to be provided by each 8(a) company that receives a contract from this procurement:  Project Manager; Program Manager; Senior Economist; Economist; Senior Transportation Specialist; Transportation Specialist; Senior Geographer; Geographer; Senior Research Analyst; Research Analyst; Senior ) Survey Methodologist;  Survey Methodologist; Senior Statistician; Statistician; Database Administrator; Senior Systems Analyst; Systems Analyst; Senior Research Assistant; Research Assistant; and IT Specialist.

A preliminary ESTIMATE is that an aggregate total of 56,240 staffing hours, per year, MAY need to be proposed by each offeror under this procurement.

It is anticipated that most of, or a substantial portion of, each contractor’s work will need to be performed in the U. S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) headquarters buildings located at 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S. E., Washington, D. C.  There is, however, a POSSIBILITY that the contract awardee(s) and DOT MIGHT be able to agree upon a set of tele-work procedures that might be used by some or all of a contract awardee’s employees. 

The forthcoming Solicitation will probably require that each winning offeror (i.e,  each contractor) obtain DOT’s approval of the contractor’s IT Security Plan for this project, within about 30 days after the awardee’s contract is issued.

IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH PROSPECTIVE OFFEROR TO CLOSELY AND FREQUENTLY MONITOR THIS FEDBIZOPPS WEBSITE FOR ANY AMENDED SYNOPSES THAT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE PUBLISHED REGARDING THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR THE FORTHCOMING SOLICITATION FOR THIS PROJECT, AND TO MONITOR FEDBIZOPPS FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION----AS SUCH PUBLICATIONS ALWAYS CONTAIN CRUCIAL INFORMATION.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has launched the Pre-positioned Equipment Program (PEP).   PEP consists of standardized equipment Pods that are located in designated geographic areas to permit rapid deployment of equipment and personnel to incidents involving the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD).<BR><BR>In eight (8) planned locations Nationwide, commercial off the shelf equipment items will be stored in pods, transportable by land or air within 1 to 12 hours after help is requested.  This equipment is specially tailored to sustain and reconstitute the capabilities of Federal, State and local first responders to react to WMD events.  Through formal request and deployment procedures, the Federal Government will transfer PEP pods to specifically designated officials.<BR><BR>A total of eight (8) operational PEP sites have been established, along with one (1) Special Events Pod (SEP).  Strategically placed throughout the country, these equipment pods will be available to respond to an incident in any major population center across the continental U.S. within 12 hours.  The FEMA plan provides for immediate ground or air transportation of the first pod, including a team of support staff.  If circumstances warrant an even greater level of support, FEMA may dispatch additional, fully-equipped pods to the site, either by ground or air. <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the Government will award a single contract with a base and four option years, that will contain firm-fixed price and time and material line items. This is a best value acquisition; therefore Offerors are cautioned that award may not necessarily be made to the lowest-priced Offeror. To be eligible for award, all Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Information on the CCR may be obtained at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil .  <BR>  <BR> <BR>Once issued, the RFP may be viewed on the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center  Natick Contracting Division webpage at https://www3.natick.army.mil .

<DESC><p>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT SYNPOSIS for Market Research to determine potential sources to perform <br />"Research on Advanced NDE Methods for Materials, Processes and Structures" for a potential future BAA announcement. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RX), Materials and Manufacturing Directorate seeks potential sources for a sixty (60) month, $6M program to perform research on NDE methods within the NDE Laboratory Facilities , buildings 655 and 71 located at WPAFB, OH (on-site at WPAFB).
<p>Because the nature and make-up of advanced aerospace materials and structures are diverse and complex, a comprehensive planning and execution of NDE research is anticipated. There are numerous well established NDE tools and techniques for use in NDE research. A partial list includes: eddy current, ultrasound, X-Ray based methods, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, boroscopy, laser based methods, terahertz methods, microwave methods, thermography, shearography, acoustic emission, and on-board monitoring methods. It is envisioned that NDE research will also require advances in the state-of-the-art, necessitating the development of new and unique tools and techniques in addition to the tools and techniques enumerated above. Materials that will be the subject of NDE research include, but are not limited to, the following materials and their associated composites: aluminum alloys; magnesium alloys; titanium alloys; nickel alloys; steels; refractory metals; advanced intermetallic compounds; niobium alloys; ceramics - monolithic; high-temperature structural ceramics based on oxides, nitrides, silicides, carbides, and borides; nanocrystalline and/or multi-layered component systems of metallics, intermetallics, and ceramics, organic materials; structural and nonstructural polymers as well as functionally graded materials, electronic materials, sensor materials, coatings and paint materials. Structures that will be the subject of NDE research will be made of the above materials and include, but are not limited to the following structures: simple plates; multilayered plate structures; plates with attached stiffeners/structure (bonded, fastened, or integral); plates or structures with rough or irregular finishes.</p>
<p>This program contains three tasks, which are to be conducted concurrently. Task I consists of project planning. Projects are selected from the following list of technical areas (in no particular order): residual stress assessment and instrumentation; structural health monitoring and prognosis; crack detection, evaluation, characterization methods; corrosion detection, evaluation, quantification methods; material characterization and materials state awareness; computational methods for NDE; technology transition; and probability of detection studies and demonstrations. Each project plan would address risks, risk mitigation and assess maturity. Depending on maturity it would be assigned to Task 2 or Task 3. Task 2 is the technology fundamentals task and consists of projects that are focused on fundamental theoretical studies, initial laboratory experiments to demonstrate feasibility and comparative studies of theory and experiments for NDE technologies. Periodic review of Task 2 projects will determine transition of a Task 2 project to a Task 3 project based on technology maturity. Task 3 is the technology applications task and consists of applied theoretical development and validation studies, development of prototype instrumentation, experiments (laboratory and field), and protocol/specification development for NDE technologies. The contractor must have personnel with the training and experience necessary to support the effort described above, and have the ability to adjust contract personnel competencies as required by the needs of the research projects. These personnel will be required to work on-site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.</p>

<p>5. ON CALL ANSWERING SERVICE SCRIPT</p>
<p>The contractor personnel (operator) shall:</p>
<p>a. use a predetermined personalized answering greeting when answering calls from MTF patients: "Thank you for calling the (MTF Medical Group) Answering Service."</p>
<p>b. provide call-screening services using a recommended statement when answering the phone. If the caller feels this is an emergency (e.g. chest pain, severe bleeding, loss of consciousness), direct them to call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room. An emergency is defined as a sudden and unexpected medical condition or the worsening of a condition that threatens life, limb, or sight and requires immediate treatment.</p>
<p>c. obtain required information from the caller: Name of caller, name and age of patient, phone number to reach the caller, provider or clinic to which patient is enrolled, and a short description of the reason for the call to relay to the on call provider.</p>
<p>d. contact appropriate provider on call immediately, expect if patient request is for appointment times, prescription refills and test results. A recommended statement will be used if the patient is calling for an appointment, results of test or refill on prescription: "The on-call provider does not have access to the appointment system, computerized pharmacy or laboratory systems needed to fulfill your request. For this information you will need to call the clinic on the next duty day."</p>
<p>e. call the provider listed on the on-call roster for the clinic stated by the patient and provide the patient's information. All clinics request the provider's pager be called first. The Government will provide the pager number and code in order for the provider to respond to the dispatch.

When the provider calls the operator, the operator shall provide them with the information given by caller/patient.</p>
<p>6. PRODUCTIVITY MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS: In order for a proposal to be properly evaluated, contractors must provide adequate documentation and explanation of their proposed plan and strategy in their Statement of Work for productivity requirements, technologic considerations for patient privacy and protection of PHI data. Offerors need to provide a price per call transaction as well as internal controls for the following monitoring and quality assurance activities:</p>
<p>a. The contractor shall answer patient calls in the order they are received within 2 minutes of call placement.</p>
<p>b. The contractor shall submit a written monthly productivity report to the MTF designee no later than the 10th working day of each month. The monthly report shall include comprehensive analyses of all activity. For example:</p>
<p>Total Number of Calls Received<br />The Service Requested By the Caller<br />Total Minutes until Call is Resolved</p>
<p>c. Operator's time is the accumulated time an operator is on incoming and outgoing calls. One (1) call is defined as an incoming call from a patient or physician for which an operator records or provides message information.

<SUBJECT>Electronic Schedule Disseminatino (ESD) 3.0 Block 1 System
<SOLNBR>ESD30BLK1AKUTAGAWA2008
<RESPDATE>082808
<CONTACT>Daryl Akutagawa, Contract Manager, Phone 310-653-1394, Email Daryl.Akutagawa.Ctr@losangeles.af.mil - Marilyn K. Washington, Contracting Officer, Phone 310-653-2072, Email marilyn.washington@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Satellite Control and Network Systems Group intends to award a sole-source contract action to Honeywell Technology Solutions, Incorporated (HTSI) for the Electronic Schedule Dissemination (ESD) 3.0 Block 1 System. This system is responsible for the scheduling of the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN). The contract action will entail the following efforts: complete the software development for Block 1 of ESD 3.0; interface with the ESD 3.0 hardware procurement (currently on contract with HTSI); complete redesign/ rework of the current ESD 3.0 database; test to verify requirements and dual-ops testing with the legacy system (ESD 2.7); and support the user-run System Evaluation Load Characterization (SELC). The Government asserts these efforts fall under FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii): Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).) <br />A determination not to compete this proposed contract action is based on the Government's requirements, supported by market research, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis is not a request for competitive quotations. This project was first put on contract with HTSI in March 2005. The schedule, cost, and mission impact of delaying the award of the contract action to competitively award the software development has justified a sole source procurement. The proposed contract action will be awarded under the existing Satellite Control Network Contract (SCNC), F04701-02-D-0006, which is a cost plus award fee contract for satellite and network control services and support. Significant software development has been completed to date, with 55% of the requirements satisfied through formal testing.
<p>The AFSCN is the Department of Defense's (DoD) primary network for supporting launch and early orbit operations. The AFSCN provides telemetry, tracking, and commanding capability, mission data dissemination and processing, and is one of the nation's primary high-powered networks for emergency recovery of space vehicles. ESD is responsible for the scheduling of over 170 satellites supported by the AFSCN. <br />The legacy system consists of ~156K lines of Borland Pascal code running on Pentium IIIs with the MS-DOS 6.22 operating system. The ESD 2.7 hardware is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain and ESD 3.0 will replace the legacy ESD 2.7 scheduling system. ESD 3.0 Block 1 will be designed to support up to 600 satellite contacts every day and maintain 2 weeks of scheduling data on-line, available at over 40 sites 24 hours a day. The award of this contract action is vital to ensure AFSCN mission success by transferring operations from the legacy system before hardware obsolescence in 2012. This ESD 3.0 Block 1 software development will include, but not be limited to, the following deliverables:</p>
<p>1. Complete Software Development of the ESD 3.0 Block 1 Capabilities<br />2. Project Management<br />3. Project Systems Engineering<br />4. Configuration Management<br />5. System Integration and Test Plan <br />6. Training Course Materials<br />7. Test and Evaluation<br />8. Maintenance Plan<br />9. Data and Documentation<br />10. Integration Logistics Support<br />11. Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)<br />12. Environmental Engineering Compliance<br />13. Interface Control Documents (ICD)<br />14. Data Accession List (DAL)<br />15. SVT System Test Procedures<br />16. System Design Specification (SDS), updated for ESD Block 1 capabilities<br />17. System Requirements Document (SRD), updated for ESD Block 1 capabilities<br />18. Implementation Plan<br />19. Mission Assurance Plan<br />20. Production Plan<br />21. Program Acceptance Plan<br />22. Quick Look Reports (QLR)<br />23. Software Development Plan<br />24. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)<br />25. Software Version Descriptions<br />26. System-Subsystem Design Document<br />27. Transition Plan</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a cost plus award fee contract action to HTSI as the prime contractor to complete the efforts required to replace the legacy ESD 2.7 system with ESD 3.0 Block 1. HTSI was awarded the Satellite Control Network Contract in December 2001 and is presently on contract for the procurement and installation of the ESD 3.0 Hardware. The Government anticipates a sole source award to the incumbent contractor, HTSI, but all responsible sources may submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to be considered by the Government. The expected contract action award date for the ESD 3.0 Block 1 software development system is the fourth quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2008. The expected contract award date for the follow-on software block upgrades with various ESD capability enhancements is the first quarter of FY 2011.</p>
<p>Responsible sources interested in this synopsis may submit their SOC electronically, with documented evidence of their ability to meet all technical, performance, and schedule requirements, no later than 28 August 2008. Responses from small and small disadvantaged business are encouraged. Submit SOCs to:</p>

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) for furniture design/layout and related services, and is being released by the General Services Administration (GSA) Region 6 FAS Furniture Team (FFT). This RFI is being issued to identify Small Business sources for potential services.  This RFI is being issued for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Requestor to acquire any products or services. If an RFP is issued, it will be officially issued by the appropriate government contracting office. The Requestor does not intend to pay for the information requested. All information provided is for government planning use only. If proprietary information is provided, please mark as Proprietary for Government Use Only.  
The exact dollar value of any RFP or subsequent award that will be issued as a result of the information received from this RFI is not known at this time. It is anticipated that the ceiling amount of any resulting RFP/award could be set at $100k, but it may be significantly less. This initiative is part of a pilot program and does not lend itself to the use of estimates based on historical data.
1. BACKGROUND:
a.	GSA is soliciting input from industry regarding furniture design/layout and related services, to support the GSA Region 6 FFT. The information obtained as a result of this RFI is intended to be utilized in the development of a future acquisition that may or may not require the services as described. 
b.	Vendors are requested to submit the following information regarding technical capabilities, industry information and industry recommendations:
i.	Can your firm provide support services for all of the objectives, tasks, and deliverables outlined in section 1.7 of the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS)?
ii.	The GSA Region 6 FFT may require short response times on design/layout services, with the potential of “last minute” meetings which may require attendance at the Contracting Office Address listed above. Does your firm posses the capability of providing these support services from an office within a sixty (60) mile radius of the Kansas City, MO, metro area? 
iii.	In cases where your firm has provided these services on a long-distance basis, how have you addressed the need for short response times, and the benefit of “in-person” meetings?
iv.	The main purpose of the attached PWS is to acquire support services from a contractor, who will in turn work with agencies in creating, defining, and refining furniture requirements. It is anticipated that a majority of these efforts will result in a procurement of furniture to be solicited and awarded by the GSA Region 6 FFT. In an effort to ensure fair competition in these efforts, can your firm confirm that it has no direct affiliation with any furniture manufacturer or dealer? If your firm does have a direct affiliation with a furniture dealer, how have you addressed issues such as these in the past, so as to ensure that all design/layout services can result in fair competition in the furniture procurement process? If awarded an IDIQ for furniture design/layout and related services, is your firm willing to be excluded from furniture procurements resulting from the services described in the attached PWS?
2.	General Requirements:
a.	The general tasks to be provided under this requirement include: development/refinement of furniture requirements; development of draft/final generic furniture typicals including possible production of CAD drawings; assistance to the FFT in creating Statements of Work (SOW)/Bills of Materials (BOM) and cost estimates; consultation in executing direct buys; consultation to agencies in the development of furniture requirements; development of self help tools;  determination of work flow and efficiencies; product line research; identification of electrical, power, and data components required for furniture and equipment; review of existing furniture designs for potential issues; assistance in preparation of packages to be used for solicitation or presentation to GSA’s Integrated Workplace Acquisition Center (IWAC); participation in conference calls with, handle inquiries from, and communicate with the IWAC; attendance and/or request of meetings with the FFT and/or Project Team(s) as required; service as a non-voting member of an evaluation team during the evaluation process for furniture procurements; review of manufacturer’s drawings for compliance with the approved final furniture design drawings. All Tasks are required to be performed under the same contract vehicle.
b.	The draft PWS is provided for industry comment.  Request vendors make suggested changes to the document using “Track Changes” for suggested enhancements and recommendations for changes.  Submitted changes/additions may or may not be included in the final solicitation.  Please contact Katie Doll, FFT Project Manager via email at katie.doll@gsa.gov for copies of the PWS and appendices.
c.	A pre-solicitation conference may be conducted at the discretion of the Government. Date and location TBD.   
d.	Questions regarding this RFI should be addressed via e-mail to Katie Doll at Katie.doll@gsa.gov no later 12:00 PM EST on August 19, 2008.  The Government response will be distributed on August 25, 2008.
e.	Interested parties shall submit their responses by email to                                                                                                                                      dale.henderson@gsa.gov no later than August 25, 2008, with a copy furnished to katie.doll@gsa.gov .

ISSUANCE DATE:	08/13/2008
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	4:30 pm Cairo time on 08/27/2008
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Middle East Environmental Advisor
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Employment Authorization
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
The incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.

B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The USAID OFFICE OF Middle East Programs in Cairo (USAID/OMEP) and the Middle East Bureau office of Technical Support in Washington (ME/TS) will jointly provide technical and programmatic supervision.  USAID/OMEP will take the supervisory lead on host mission activities while the Middle East BEO will take the supervisory lead on environmental compliance (Reg. 216) responsibilities.  The REA reports to both the USAID/OMEP Deputy Director and the ME BEO, and uses professional judgment and skills to plan and carry out assigned activities, projects, or other assignments.  S/he develops recommendations to solve difficult problems without precedent, proposes solutions to complex issues and discusses recommendations with his/her technical supervisors.  S/he is considered the lead authority for the Missions and an Agency expert on environmental review and compliance procedures and evaluation issues.  The work is technically authoritative and almost always accepted without substantive change and is only reviewed for conformance to Agency policy.

The Regional Environmental Advisor (REA) for the Middle East will be physically located in Cairo, Egypt, but co-funded by ME/TS and USAID/OMEP.  Consequently, there must be close collaboration between the USAID/OMEP Deputy Director and ME BEO to ensure: accountability, service to the host and client missions, day-to-day supervision, and adequate backstopping.  To achieve this, management responsibilities of the host Mission and ME/TS are:

1.	Selection and retention are determined collaboratively by USAID/OMEP and ME/TS.

2.	The host office (USAID/OMEP) will provide day-to-day supervision and logistical support, while ME/TS will provide overall technical and policy guidance, and will coordinate and prioritize regional Reg. 216 backstopping responsibilities (in coordination with the host Mission).

3.	Annual work plans with regular updates are required and will be approved by the OMEP and the ME BEO.  These work plans and updates will be prepared in close consultation with client bilateral Middle East Missions.

4.	Quarterly reports, including individual trip reports, will be submitted to both the USAID/OMEP Program Officer and the ME BEO.

5.	Annual performance evaluations will be coordinated by OMEP with input from the ME BEO and the client bilateral Middle East Missions.

6.	In exchange for the above described management services, OMEP can expect up to 20% of the Advisor's time to be spent in its service with the remaining time spent serving other clients, especially bilateral Middle East Missions.

7.	The incumbent will be required to travel to other Middle East countries, Washington, D.C., and other localities in the performance of his/her duties.  It is anticipated that approximately 50 % of the incumbent's time will be spent traveling to other countries in the Middle East, including critical priority countries (Iraq, West Bank, Lebanon), with occasional trips to AID/W for consultations.  All travel shall have the prior approval of the USAID/OMEP Program Officer, or authorized designee.

C.	OVERVIEW:

Middle East

The Middle East Bureau of USAID provides overall leadership for Agency programs in the Middle East (ME) region.  This includes programs in response to urgent foreign policy priorities; large and politically sensitive efforts in Egypt and Jordan; and volatile conflict and post-conflict situations in Iraq, WB/Gaza, Yemen, and Lebanon.  

ME/TS is a shared services office responsible for providing leadership and technical support on development issues in the Middle East region through analysis, strategy development, program design, technical assistance and information dissemination.  ME/TS guides the Bureaus’ strategic thinking in technical areas, reviews performance by operating units, and advises on the appropriate allocation of resources to them.  Within ME/TS, the ME BEO is responsible for assuring that ME strategies and programs comply with the mandatory requirements of the Agency’s environmental procedures (22 CFR 216; aka Reg. 216), as well as with legislative and policy mandates on the environment (e.g., the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), USAID’s environmental policy directives; and the Foreign Assistance Act as amended in Sections 117, 118, and 119.

The environmental compliance workload is daunting.  In FY 2007, the ME BEO reviewed and processed over 200 environmental compliance documents for over $8.5 billion in Life-of-Project funds.  This included Environmental Assessments for over $3 billion in infrastructure and other ME activities.  Given the high visibility and strategic sensitivity of many of these programs, both careful review and rapid turn around are mandatory.  Ensuring appropriate environmental review and providing assistance with Reg. 216 compliance have emerged as important areas of backstopping for ME/TS.  

Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP)

USAID has established a regional presence at the USAID/Egypt Mission.  The Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) allows USAID to better use its regional resources, expertise, and support services for the seven USAID Missions in the Middle East and North Africa (MEA) region, and serves as a way for USAID to better manage the common set of challenges present throughout the region.

The objectives of OMEP include the following: 

1.	Establish and implement a new regional program focused on common, transboundary issues within the Middle East. 
2.	Coordinate the provision of regional support services (acquisition and assistance, legal, financial management, technical, executive office, program) to the client missions of Lebanon, Morocco, and Yemen. 
3.	Administer select MEPI activities. 
4.	Monitor, and as necessary provide implementation support for USAID activities in non-presence countries in the MEA region. 
5.	Provide facilities for TDYs and surge capacity, as the need arises. 

USAID regional programs include support for regional water cooperation, promotion of educational opportunities and access through scholarships and increased regional publishing, advancement of economic growth and democracy, and promotion of public-private partnerships to increase the impact of USG expenditures. 

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

Basic Functions of the Position:

As a member of both ME/TS and OMEP environment teams, the Regional Environmental Advisor  for the Middle East, based in Cairo, Egypt, provides specialized policy, strategic and technical advice in the areas of environmental review and impact assessment and environment sector programming in the Middle East.  The REA will support USAID Missions in the Middle East and their implementing partners, host country national governments, and, as appropriate, other USG agencies (i.e., Department of State, OPIC, TDA, ExIm Bank, DOI, Treasury, EPA, USDA/USFS, DOE) and regional and international organizations that are active in Middle East.  Eighty percent (80%) of the REA’s time will be spent supporting USAID programs in the region and up to 20% supporting OMEP’s environment program. The REA's areas of assistance include USAID environmental procedures; environmental impact assessment, monitoring, and mitigation; strategic planning; program development and monitoring; and managing for results.  The position is supported by the ME/TS office as well as OMEP.  

Duties and Responsibilities

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps (USMC), Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), seeks a vendor to provide a performance capability upgrade for existing, mounted USMC Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems. The existing, mounted USMC CREW systems are currently at a CREW 2.0 performance capability level.  The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify alternatives to upgrade the existing systems to a minimum of CREW 2.1 capability level. This additional capability upgrade can be accomplished in one of two ways:1)	As an add-on type system to address the required, additional CREW 2.1 spectrum coverage or provide additional partial CREW 2.0 spectrum coverage as well as the additional spectrum coverage required by CREW 2.1.2)	As a complete stand-alone system that would fully address the complete CREW 2.0/2.1 spectrum coverage.
The above add-on capability is desired to be integrated into the existing USMC CREW systems. If the Government pursues this course of action, the existing systems will be made available for integration.Proposed systems should be mature (TRL 7 or above) and be ready for immediate fabrication, test and production. The system should be capable of the following:1)	Allow rapid field waveform reprogramming to address emerging threats.2)	Be interoperable with Blue Force communications and other operating systems.3)	Able to operate using several Universal Timing Protocols (UTPs).4)	Address multiple threats at an operationally effective distance.5)	Have size, weight, power, volume requirements that will minimize integration effort into various USMC vehicles.6)	Have an antenna and mounting system that will minimize integration effort into various USMC vehicles.Qualified vendors must be capable of providing personnel with expert knowledge of DoD CREW systems and possess a DoD Secret facility clearance.Vendors capable of providing the required service are invited to submit a response to this notice. Vendors are encouraged to submit responses to both capability upgrade options listed above, however it is not mandatory that both options be provided. Vendors shall include; system description, performance specifications and parameters, overall capabilities of the system against the above general requirements, the TRL of the system with justification and any additional, pertinent information. The Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) for this effort is Mr. Robert Huggins, telephone: (703) 432-3218, or e:mail at: Robert.Huggins@usmc.mil.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
Request for Information:
The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is seeking information regarding the capabilities of commercially available integrated computer display systems.
Background:
The United States Marine Corps (USMC) tactical (HMMWV, MTVR, LVSR, MRAP, ITV) and combat (AAV, LAV, EFV, Tanks) vehicle programs are facing problems with limitations in size, weight, power, human factors, and safety related to the proliferation of GFE electronics systems being integrated into their vehicle platforms. Each new electronics system requires its own display/monitor/control panel, taking significant Size, Weight and Power (SWAP) budget and impacting safe and effective operation of the vehicles.  
Requirement:
MARCORSYSCOM is interested in pursuing a consolidated, common display technology that can accept and effectively display input in multiple formats/interfaces from vehicle electronics systems (health monitoring systems, sensor systems, situational awareness systems, communication systems, weapons systems, routers, etc.) and where required, allow control of those systems from the common display.  
The overall goal is to limit displays to no more than one (1) per crew/occupant position.  The desired display units should: 1) be configurable to permit viewing and control of any input system; 2) be configurable to allow monitoring multiple systems simultaneously; 3) have displays that are identical and interchangeable between positions; 4) be based on flat screen technology (LCD, plasma, or similar); 5) allow for connection through multiple types of data connectors, and accept inputs from analog and digital data and video signals; 6) have the ability to display multi-format video input formats, possessing disparate resolution formats (VGA, SVGA, XGA, SXGA, etc.) and 7) be based on varying software languages, 8) include an anti-glare or filtering system to allow for viewing in direct sunlight, and brightness control for viewing through Night Vision Goggles; 9) shall be ruggedized and sealed to resist damage or degradation while operating in typical USMC environments (salt fog, salt spray, dirt, mud, etc.); 10) require minimal power to mitigate vehicle power demand; and 11) have a touch screen or other method for users to input data and/or control systems/applications displayed, operable in MOPP IV and Cold Weather Gear.   

Firms possessing the capabilities to accomplish this requirement are invited to submit the following: Company information to include the business size (large business, small business, 8(a), veteran owned small disadvantaged business, etc), Statement of capabilities and current GSA contract information (if available on GSA).  This sources sought/request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisition.  No entitlement to pay of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government use of such information.  Proprietary information submitted in response to this synopsis will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.  Responses to this RFI should be mailed or delivered via FEDEX, UPS, or DHL to the following address no later than 3:00 p.m. EST, 26 Sept 2008. No phone calls will be accepted:
MARCORSYSCOM/CT025 Attn: Stacey R. Watson (PM MT)2200 Lester Street, Building 2203AQuantico MCB, VA 22134
Interested sources shall be invited to an industry day to be held in Quantico, VA at a future date.  Attendance to this event allows vendors to demonstrate their products, view current vehicle configurations, and ask questions to USMC personnel.  Classification:  UNCLASSIFIED

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to acquire Challenge brand Programmable Paper Cutter and Challenge brand Three Spindle Paper Drills.  The requirement shall include annual service contracts on all equipment.  This equipment will directly replace the existing Challenge MS10 drill press and Challenge Diamond 26" paper cutter with similar industrial level equipment.  These machines have been in operation for almost 30 years and parts are no longer available for these models.  The main justification for soliciting only Challenge brand manufacturers and vendors is that SSA will save hundreds of dollars in auxiliary parts and consumable supplies from the old Challenge brand equipment that SSA will use with new Challenge equipment.  Post installation support and service, requiring factory-trained technicians, is an essential part of this requirement.  Interested parties who feel they can provide this requirement may respond by submitting their capability statement via email to Deborah. R. Wilson@ssa.gov by COB August 19, 2008.  The information I receive I will consider solely for determining whether to conduct other than a brand name only procurement.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation for offers.  A determination by the Government not to solicit brand name only equipment for this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If I receive no responses by the closing date (8/19/08), the SSA will proceed with the Challenge brand name only solicitation.  Vendors must submit all questions and/or submissions to this notice in writing to the email address referenced above.  I will not accept telephone calls regarding this notice, nor will I return any.  Responses must reference SSA-RFQ-08-1811.

Battelle Memorial Institute is the only laboratory in the US that has a history of potency testing of botulism antitoxins owned and stored by the US Army Medical Material Development Activity with developed validated tests of the antitoxin.

<DESC><p>Base wide event--OKTOBERFEST<br />For more than 50 years Edwards Air Force Base has been distinguished by more major milestones in flight than any other place on earth. Covering nearly 301,000 acres, Edwards is located in the Mojave Desert, adjacent to Rogers Dry Lakebed. Even though remote, Edwards is home to military and their families, as well as employer to over 8,000 civilian employees.
<p>There is something for everyone at OKTOBERFEST which draws crowds of 3,000- 4,000 people of all ages. In addition to the food, beer and musical entertainment there will be a pumpkin carving contest, bouncy castles and face painting for the children, everything you would expect from an OKTOBERFEST celebration. This is a great opportunity to raise customer awareness of your company with this exclusive military demographic.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is fundamental to the success of this event. Edwards AFB invites you to join in supporting the moral, welfare and recreation of our military and their dependents by becoming a commercial sponsor for the Fall Festival. Sponsorship may take the form of monetary or in-kind contributions. <br /><br />In appreciation for your sponsorship, your company will receive public recognition and exposure. The level of exposure is determined by the level of sponsorship, with all sponsors prominently acknowledged throughout the event. Sponsor exposure may include name and logo recognition on all event print media, including posters, signage, and banners, brochures, pictures and media coverage. More than one sponsor may be accepted and additives will be considered. Request for copies of this solicitation must be received no later than 12September 2008. All offers will be considered.</p>
<p>Under paragraph 4.1 of Air Force Instruction (AFI) 34-407, we are unable to solicit sponsorship from alcohol or tobacco companies, or from defense contractors, including their affiliates, subcontractors, teaming partners, or joint venture partners. Depending on the circumstances, unsolicited sponsorship offers may be accepted if those offers are not in conflict with existing contracts, memorandums of agreement or understanding, or detrimental to business relationships between military and existing civilian contractors. Unsolicited offers are not accepted from barred contractors. If your company is disqualified due to the above criteria, we ask that you do not respond to this sponsorship solicitation.</p>
<p>This is a solicitation for commercial sponsorship by a non appropriated funds instrumentality of the United States Government and does not obligate appropriated funds of the Government.</p>

<p>1. Identify the current existing DTA database, which is located at SwRI, for all the various FCLs currently being tracked by the USAF.<br />2. Update the DTA for an existing fuselage location. <br />3. Analyze three new FCL locations revealed by the recent teardown inspections. <br />4. Develop inspection requirements for new FCL's<br />5. Develop a comprehensive DTA package for the T-37 aircraft.</p>
<p>The T-37 aircraft is currently being used by the United States Air Force and subject to retire from active service in September 2009.</p>
<p>T-37 Data Tolerance Analysis (DTA), Fatigue Critical Location (FCL) Update and Data Consolidation Package effort will be awarded as a sole SwRI as other than full &amp; open competition based on SwRI past performance and history with previous T-37 engineering services directly relating to this effort. SwRI currently maintains the most up-to date T-37 Aircraft Structural Integrity Program data base. Additionally, as the T-37 transitions from active to retired service life, it would&nbsp;be unacceptable and uneconomical due to delays caused by transfer of data, configuration management, safety of flight assurance and production costs if awarded to another vendor</p>
<p>T-37 data will be provided by SwRI following the conclusion of the DTA data package updates &amp; consolidation.</p>
<p>1. Describe your ability to develop and incorporate aircraft structural analysis into comprehensive data packages.</p>
<p>2. Describe your experience and ability to analyze aircraft fatigue critical locations and processes for developing sound inspection criteria formatted into Technical Orders.</p>
<p>3. Describe your experience transforming structural analysis into configuration drawings.</p>
<p>4. Describe your ability and experience updating technical orders or technical manuals.</p>
<p>5. Demonstrate experience in handling unclassified hardware and software, including source code.</p>
<p>6. Demonstrate ability to process classified information.</p>
<p><br />NAICS Code 541330 has been assigned. Responders to this synopsis shall include their assigned DUNS Number and their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.</p>
<p>Responses should be sent to: 558ACSG/PK, ATTN: Mr. James Warburton, 6072 Fir Ave., Building 1233, Hill AFB, UT 84056-5850. Any questions should be referred to the contracting officer, Mr. Leo Garcia, 801-777-4207, or e-mail leo.garcia@hill.af.mil.</p>

Description

MOA Study, Quantity of 1 Year 
STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


I. Background

Arthropods transmit the etiologic agents of several human diseases causing an important impact on public health within the United States. The blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) is the principal vector of Lyme disease spirochetes, the agent causing human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and human babesiosis. Fleas transmit plague causing bacteria in the United States, and mosquitoes transmit the West Nile Virus and other arboviruses within the United States. The primary means of controlling these arthropod vectors has mainly relied on the use of area-wide pesticides.  However, the number of pesticides currently registered for arthropod control has been decreasing in recent years.  Furthermore, many species have developed resistance to various classes of pesticides.  Finally, many citizens are hesitant about the use of synthetic pesticides due to concerns about short range toxicity and long range health problems attributed to these chemicals. 

Plants have long been shown to have natural chemical defenses against arthropods. The exploitation of plants to provide natural, least-toxic pesticides and repellents is a high priority for CDC in the combat against vector-borne disease.  In addition, DVBID scientists have been developing host-targeted methods of controlling disease vectors and reducing populations of infected rodent reservoirs. Development of new, environmentally safe vector-control methods is a very high priority for DVBID and CDC.  Natural products may prove more acceptable to the public than traditional pesticides and have the potential to act against pesticide-resistant vectors.  In addition, alternative natural based repellents with low to zero toxicity will benefit the public by providing an alternative to Deet and other synthetic repellents.  Natural plant products as insecticides and repellents may provide an eco-friendly method of vector-borne disease control in the residential setting.  This could be a win-win solution both for public health and the environment.

CDC, DVBID scientists have researched, developed, and patented a class of all natural chemicals from botanical forest resources.  The activity of these compounds has been intensely evaluated in both laboratory and field trials.  The next step in the development and registration process of these compounds for public health use is to determine the mode of action (MOA) for these all natural compounds.
 
II. Purpose

Scientists at CDC/DVBID have patented a class of compounds extracted from Alaska yellow cedar (AYC).  These compounds are comprised of both monoterpenes and eremophilane sesquiterpenes and are common to not only species of cedars but citrus products and other natural plants and herbs.  Our research has revealed that these compounds are excellent candidates as acaricides, insecticides and repellents against important public health vectors including ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes.  These compounds have been extensively evaluated in both laboratory and field trials with great success.  We have evidence demonstrating the pesticidal and repellent activity of these compounds but now we need to determine how these compounds function to kill arthropods.  Knowledge of the MOA will allow us to evaluate what class of synthetic compounds these natural products may potentially replace where insecticide resistance has become a problem.  Determining the MOA might allow us to target resistant arthropod vector populations where pesticides with different modes of action have been heavily utilized. 

III. SCOPE OF WORK

These will be initial attempts at determining the mechanism of action for two all natural compounds that have been researched, developed, and patented by CDC/DVBID scientists.  We wish to have the MOA’s for carvacrol (a monoterpene) and nootkatone (an eremophilane sesquiterpene) evaluated.  There are many registered/known pesticides that can be further broken down into common name/trade names, classes of pesticides, the targeted system or process of how they affect pests, and finally the mode of action.  Therefore, we propose to the applicant to begin the process by targeting 5 primary MOA’s:
1)  Cholinesterase Inhibition - Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are known as cholinesterase inhibitors. They bind to the enzyme that is normally responsible for breaking down acetylcholine (Ach) after it has carried its message across the synapse.
2) Acetylcholine Receptor Stimulation - Neonicotinoid and spinosad insecticides act as
agonists of the acetylcholine receptor. That is, they mimic the action of the neurotransmitter, ACh.
3) Chloride Channel Regulation – Avermectins, Organochlorine insecticides of the
cyclodiene type and Bifenazate all have different derivatives but function as GABA receptor inhibitors, excitors, or agonists.
4)  Sodium Channel Modulators - Pyrethrins and pyrethroids act on tiny channels through which sodium is pumped to cause excitation of neurons. They prevent the sodium channels from closing, resulting in continual nerve impulse transmission, tremors, and eventually, death.
5) Octopamine Receptor Agonists – Formamidines are thought to work by inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase.  This results in the accumulation of biogenic amines, e.g., octopamine.  Formamidines induce abnormal behavior in pests: reduced feeding, dispersal from plants, erratic mating behavior, and detachment of ticks from their host.



IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

The vendor shall perform the following tasks in the order shown:

1) Determine the MOA of nootkatone, a 15 carbon ring eremophilane sesquiterpene and carvacrol (isothymol), a 10 carbon ring monoterpene.  The vendor will be provided with a minimum of 50 grams each of pure nootkatone (> 95%, nootkatone EX valencene) and carvacrol (> 85% isothymol).  The vendor will determine the MOA of both natural compounds against an appropriate/suitable insect or arthropod species.  The vendor can use appropriate in vitro, in vivo, and/or culture assays to determine the MOA.   

V. Government Furnished Property

Not applicable.

VI. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance shall commence upon receipt of a purchase order and shall continue for a period of 365 days.  

VII. Deliverables

The vendor shall provide the following deliverables to the project officer by the dates shown:

DELIVERABLES				DATE REQUIRED

A. MOA of nootkatone & carvarol	 	Within 12 months after receipt of purchase
against an appropriate insect or		order.
arthropod species using in vitro, in
vivo, and/or culture techniques.  				

VIII.  MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS
The vendor must be fully familiar with the research areas of entomology, insecticide toxicology, environmental toxicology, and chemistry.  The vendor should be proficient in the specifics of insecticide toxicology including mechanisms of action and toxicity.  The vendor should have knowledge of natural products as insecticides.

Rationale for Other Than Full and Open Competition:

The Customer Engagement Office (EGM) needs external hard drives that meet the specifications listed above.  EGM requires multiple ports, ruggedized, durable case, and a positive on/off switch.  Because these external storage devices are provided to a variety of customers external to NGA using disparate systems unknown to NGA, we require the units to have the most types of interfaces available, including all cables, to satisfy any customer connectivity.  The external storage devices are shipped to remote and non-administrative type environments and are frequently subject to abusive conditions.  Therefore, durable cases are required.  Lastly, an on/off switch makes connectivity and usage easier at the customer locations.

Market research indicates that only Other World Computing (OWC) brand, model Mercury On-the-Go, meets the specification for a quad interface, ruggedized, durable case and positive on/off switch.

Description:

 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in
 accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13.

                     This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are
being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The North
American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) 541690.  This is a small business

BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE.

The NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL) has a requirement
for a service to optimize the performance of the Molecular Measuring Machine
in accordance with the following Performance Work Statement (PWS):


   -----BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT--------

           Performance Work Statement for Molecular Measuring Machine:
           Z-Motion Actuator Assembly
             


I.	BACKGROUND

This procurement is being conducted for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory (MEL), Precision Engineering Division (PED).

The Molecular Measuring Machine (M3) is a two-dimensional coordinate measuring instrument that uses a scanning probe microscope as the imaging probe and a laser interferometer system to measure feature placement with sub-nanometer resolution over a 50 mm by 50 mm area.  The goal for the instrument is to achieve 1 nm uncertainty for point-to-point measurements.  This requires a stable vibration and temperature environment; error-mapping of the motion guides; and a careful analysis of the sources of error and uncertainty.  The instrument is also contained in a high vacuum chamber.  

The vertical (Z axis) motion assembly for this instrument is a crucial component with many competing design goals that have to be weighed off against each other and optimized.  The Z axis assembly incorporates a coarse motion piezoceramic linear stepping motor; a potentiometer position sensor; a piezoceramic driven, flexure guided fine motion stage; and an integrated capacitance displacement sensor.  It has gone though several design iterations.  The current design is workable, but further research and development and characterization is needed for improved performance.
A journal publication about M3 is available for further background information:  “Nanometer Resolution Metrology with the NIST Molecular Measuring Machine,” John A. Kramar, Measurement Science and Technology 16(11), 2121–2128 (November 2005)

II.SCOPE OF WORK
The purposes of this requirement are:

1.Optimize the performance of the coarse and fine 
M3 Z-motion actuators and the Z-axis position measurement sensors.

2.Characterize the motion errors for the M3 Z-axis motion assembly and develop a full error map and uncertainty statement so that measurements performed with the actuator can be error-corrected and accurately reported;

III.SPECIFIC TASKS
The Contractor shall provide all labor and supervision to complete the following tasks:

1.Optimize the range and motion trueness of the Z fine-motion actuator while maintaining acceptable dynamic response.  This optimization shall include:

a.finite element analysis of key elements, with design optimization for optimal range and dynamic response within material and space constraints.  (A NIST-supplied finite element analysis package is available.)  

b.shop drawings of parts to be built; assembly.

c.measurements of the motion range, dynamic response, and motion trueness before and after any design changes to assess performance improvements.

d.analysis of performance relative to FE predictions.

2.Implement a capacitance gage displacement sensor for measuring the Z-fine motion displacement relative to the coarse motion device, and characterize its noise, accuracy, and dynamic response.

a.the capacitance gage shall measure the displacement in the Z-axis, and also the pitch and yaw of the translation.  It shall be calibrated against an interferometer and an autocollimator, supplied by NIST.

b.the gage shall be interfaced with the M3 control software so its output can be used for real-time control or monitoring of the axis motion

3.Generate an error map of the M3 Z fine-motion axes.  This error map shall include angular and linear deviation from straightness as a function of position, and shall include an assessment of repeatability and measurement uncertainty.  It shall be correlated to the position as measured by the capacitance gage sensor described in task #2.

4.Record all work and data collection conditions and parameters in a laboratory notebook which shall remain the property of NIST.  Store collected data from measurement runs on a backed-up NIST file server, file locations noted in the lab notebook.  

5.Author and prepare manuscripts for publication of research and measurement results in appropriate scientific journals, and deliver presentations regarding the research at appropriate professional conferences.

In performing these tasks, the contractor shall research the technical literature and solicit advice from experts in the various disciplines, as appropriate, in order to ensure best practice and technique.

IV.DELIVERABLES AND REPORTS

Measurement results from all calibration runs and measurements of trueness, dynamic response, noise, and measurement uncertainty, shall be documented in a laboratory notebook that shall remain the property of NIST.  Finite element and optimization results shall also be documented in the laboratory notebook and available for continuing research.  Electronic data files shall be stored on a regularly backed-up NIST file server, with file locations referenced in the laboratory notebook.  Component designs and shop drawings shall be delivered to, and remain the property of, NIST.


1.Daily activities shall be documented in a laboratory notebook that will remain the property of NIST.

2.Weekly oral status reports shall be given every Wednesday and it shall include
the status of the projects and tasks and near term plans and projections. The
weekly orals reports shall be given between the hours of 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.,
per the Contracting Officer’s Representative.
        

3.Three (3) Quarterly research reports shall be produced and submitted
within two (2) weeks, at the end of each month period in the contract.

4.Significant measurements and research results shall be documented in a manuscript suitable for publication as a NIST internal report or in an external journal.  This manuscript shall include procedures, data, and analysis, along with appropriate figures and tables.

5.When warranted, as determined by the M3 Project Leader, research results shall be presented at a suitable professional conference, for example, the annual meeting of the American Society for Precision Engineering.

V.DELIVERABLE DUE DATES AND/OR PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

Except for the weekly oral status reports and quarterly written research reports, the
due dates for all the other deliverables is the end of the contract period. The order in

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES ARE BEING UTILIZED AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. 

 ***This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-26.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested vendors may submit a quotation.***

*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking to purchase One (1) PIXIS:  1024BR CCD Camera System or EQUIVALENT.*** The Optical Technology Division (OTD) at NIST requires a laboratory grade CCD camera.  The camera will be coupled to several pieces of equipment depending on the application.  The camera will be used as an imaging detector for scene analysis (hyperspectral imaging) that will require high speed data acquisition at times and long exposure times during other situations.  The camera is also intended to be used as a detector for spectral data collection from a spectrometer where low dark noise will be essential.  These two examples are among a number of applications.***

***BACKGROUND*** One of the goals of the OTD at NIST is the development and dissemination of absolute radiometric, photometric, and colorimetric standards.  The OTD meets the needs of the lighting, imaging, automotive, electronics, health and medical, biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy, chemical, and other industries dependent upon optical measurements.  Two of the particular projects in the Optical Sensors Group of the OTD are the Vision Science Project and the Total Spectral Radiant Flux Project.  The Vision Science Project will develop a new metrics for color rendering of light sources (a proposal to replace or supplement CIE Color Rendering Index) and to establish an international standard on effective intensity of flashing lights, both of which are urgent for the industry.  These efforts will require scene analysis.  The Total Spectral Radiant Flux project develops total spectral radiant flux standards that are required to calibrate integrating sphere systems employing a spectroradiometer. Such integrating sphere systems are increasingly used for measurement of color and total luminous flux of light sources such as discharge lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).  Lower light level sources will require more sensitive spectral measurements than are currently capable at NIST.

***Line item 0001 is a BRAND NAME or EQUAL requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency’s needs.***

WORK STATEMENT - -INTRODUCTIONThe National Park Service (NPS), acting through Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) and located in northern Arizona, proposes to conduct an intensive archaeological inventory survey. The surveys will be conducted in association with treatment of lands using prescribed fire within the project areas. The current inventory will be located within the Roost burn unit, located on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park (Figure 1). The Roost burn unit encompasses and area of approximately 20,128 total acres broken up into seven sub-units. Initial survey to be conducted totals 854 acres. Additional survey may be requested as funding allows. Inventory locations may be a mix of pre- and post-fire areas, pending approval of final survey plan. The surveys are necessary to meet Section 110 cultural resource identification, assessment, and evaluation, and Section 106 identification prior to undertakings, as required in the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. 
Only limited intensive inventory survey (3,000 acres) has been completed within the Roost burn unit. This project shall locate and record all archaeological sites within the predetermined survey blocks. Additionally, site record updates will be completed for any previously documented site(s) within the survey blocks. 
The project defined herein shall be performed in accordance with this scope of work under the authorization of the Antiquities Act of 1906, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as amended), the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) of 1979 (as amended), the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, and in conformance with approved policies and guidelines of the National Park Service.  If human remains are discovered during this project, the contractor shall immediately notify the Branch Chief of Cultural Resources for the park.
BACKGROUND 
GRCA is known to contain locally, regionally, and nationally significant cultural resources.  Historic properties within the park include prehistoric sites from the Archaic, Ancestral Puebloan, Cohonina, and Cerbat traditions, protohistoric sites, historic period Native American sites, as well as Euro American sites. Although many archaeological surveys of varying intensities have been conducted in lands within GRCA, only a few, localized archaeological surveys have been conducted within the Roost burn unit. Archaeological site densities in these interior units on North Rim of the Grand Canyon are typically low due to heavy understory vegetation. GRCA lands encompassed by this proposal and designated for survey are accessible by paved and dirt roads.  Topography of the survey areas vary. The Roost Burn Unit is located adjacent to Highway 67 on the North Rim of Grand Canyon.  Elevations in the Roost burn unit range between 8,800 and 8,852 feet.  Vegetation in the burn unit consists largely of mixed conifer and mountain meadow communities. Visitor services on the North Rim close between October 15 and early May each year.  Highway 67 closes at Jacob Lake when it becomes impassable due to snow in the winter.  The exact dates of the closure vary from winter to winter.
The Principal Investigator and crew chief must meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualifications for Archeology and must be able to obtain an ARPA permit.
The contractor and all employees must follow the Grand Canyon National Park Cultural Resources Site Disclosure Standard Operating Procedure
SCOPE OF WORK
Archaeological investigations for this project shall include the following:Pre-field Research. Background research regarding previous archeological research and previously recorded sites shall be conducted by GRCA staff prior to commencement of the field survey.  The results of this research will be provided to the contractor and shall be incorporated into the final report.
The contractor will be responsible for researching historic activity in the project areas.  Most information can be found in the park archives at the Grand Canyon National Park Museum Collection on the South Rim, Grand Canyon National Park.Field and Laboratory Work. The fieldwork shall conform to the "Intensive" archaeological survey as defined in the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation.  Fieldwork shall include the following requirements:  	a. 	The survey shall be a 100%-coverage, pedestrian survey within previously unsurveyed areas within select transects within the Roost burn unit.  The NPS will provide the layout for the survey transects for the Roost burn unit during the pre-work meeting.  Survey shall be designed to locate and document all archaeological resources within the survey areas. b.	Field personnel spacing on survey transects shall not exceed 20 meters.c.	An aluminum "racetrack" tag will be fixed to a tree within the site boundary.  The tag will be stamped with the site number issued for the site.  Site numbers will be given to the contractor at the pre-work meeting.  Site tags and nails will be provided to the contractor by the NPS.  The location of the tag tree will be shown on the site map.  d.	Site definitions will follow Arizona State Museum (ASM) standards as follows: 1)	Any cultural remains that are at least 50 years old and meet one of the following criteria: 
a)	Has 30+ artifacts of a single class within an area 15 meters in diameter, except when all pieces appear to generate from a single source, such as a broken pot.
b)	Or, has 20+ artifacts which include at least two classes of artifact types within an area 15 meters in diameter.
c)	Or, has one or more archaeological features in temporal association with any number of artifacts.
	d)	Or, has two or more temporally associated archaeological features without artifacts.
e.	Each site shall be plotted on the appropriate 7.5 minute USGS topographic map.f.	Each site will be located and mapped utilizing GPS/GIS technologies.  All GPS/GIS data will be provided in the following datum: UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), NAD (North American Datum) 1983, Zone 12 S.  To maintain data integration all data will be collected utilizing the data dictionary provided by the GRCA staff.  A GPS data point with an error no greater than 10 meters will be taken for the location of each site tag.  Polygon boundaries for each site will be located with GPS as outlined above.  Additional GPS files should be taken as appropriate such as polygons of loci boundaries and line files for linear features such historic roads.g.	Actual survey transects and/or survey areas will be recorded using GPS/GIS technologies, following the parameters laid out in (f) above.h.	Photography shall consist of digital photography and 35 mm black-and-white print photographs. Site photographs shall include: 1) two exposures of each site from different directions with the tag tree centered in the photographs and, where possible, a location reference on the horizon in the background; and 2) one site overview photograph; 3) one photograph of each feature recorded, and 4) a photograph of any unique or unusual artifact(s) encountered. Where appropriate, close-up or detail photographs shall include a sign board identifying the site and feature, and a north arrow indicating direction of the view. Digital photography shall be in raw or tiff file format with a minimum resolution of 4.0 mega pixels. Digital images shall be delivered on CD in uncompressed tiff format at 600 dpi resolution. The digital images on CD shall be organized in folders by site number. i.	Photo logs shall be maintained for digital and 35 mm images that include the roll number, exposure number, subject description (including site and/or feature numbers as may be applicable), date, photographer(s) name, and direction of photo. The digital photo log shall use image file numbers in place of exposure numbers.  GRCA will provide an electronic copy of a photographic log at the pre-work meeting. j.	GRCA archaeological site forms shall be completed for each site that is visited.  GRCA archaeology site forms require in-field identification of the artifact assemblage for each site (that is, GRCA artifact identification forms will be completed for each category of items, such as ceramic and lithic artifacts, historic cans, etc).  If fewer than 200 sherds and 100 lithic artifacts are present, all artifacts will be identified.  If there are more artifacts, a representative sample unit will be chosen and the artifacts within that sample area will be identified. Sites with one or more roomblock or midden features shall require a representative sample unit for each feature and a sample unit for the general artifact scatter, if applicable. Diagnostic artifacts will be identified, dated, sketched on the site form.k.	Each GRCA site form shall include a site plan map and feature maps if applicable.  Field maps may be completed by compass and tape or a similar method.  The contractor will convert hand-drawn field maps to an editable electronic version using software such as Adobe Illustrator (version 9 or earlier).  That is, the final electronic version of the site map will not simply be a scanned image of the hand-drawn map but will have the map data converted to editable layers, features, and/or objects. All site plan and feature maps will include the following information:1.	Site number2.	Name of person who produced the field map3.	Date of map4.	Scale bar5.	Estimated contour interval6.	North arrow (true or magnetic indicated)7.	Name of person who made the electronic version of the mapl.	All isolated occurrences (IO) shall be located using GPS as described previously. Isolated occurrences are those objects that do not meet the site definitions described under item D.  An electronic copy of the log for tracking isolated occurrences will be provided to the contractor by the NPS at the pre-work meeting.  m.	The contractor will enter all data from the site forms into the Grand Canyon Archaeological Site Database.  The NPS will provide access to the database and provide basic training in GRCA data entry procedures.  The contractor will be required to complete data entry activities at the park, under the supervision of NPS personnel.  The NPS will file the final version of all site records.n.	The contractor will enter all photographs into the Grand Canyon Archaeological Photographic Database.  The contractor is responsible for printing and mounting photographs onto photographic information cards and for transferring 35mm negatives to archival negative sleeves.  NPS staff will file cards and negatives into the Grand Canyon archaeological photographic archives.	Analysis and Report Preparation.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] 
(1) Listed end products.

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] 
[  ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. 
[  ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. 
(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly— 
(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or 
(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that—

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-66RB54 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.  This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611. 

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.     (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.     (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:     (i) warrants;     (ii) options;     (iii) contracts to acquire stock;     (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.     (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.     (f) Disclosure.     By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103.  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:
Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington D.C. 20593-0001, Telephone 202-372-3695, Fax: 202-475-3904.

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 29 AUG, 2008, 1:00 p.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 15 SEP 2008. Contact Bill Kingsley at  william.t.kingsley@uscg.mil or 252-384-7283 for questions regarding this solicitation. Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above address.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

incorporated entity; or

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSD7/7/2008Project: Documentary Video clipsThe National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) web site http://www.ncptsd.va.gov is a resource for anyone investigating PTSD, whether for professional or personal reasons.  With a catalogue of information, including fact sheets, clinical resources, and research links, the site provides a much needed anchor for clinicians as well as the general public.  The Center is currently working to make sure that the information available on the site is accessible to everyone.  This acquisition's expected range is from $100,000 to $250,000.Videotape is a medium for relating the experiences of the current wave of soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and will add a human layer to the website experience.   Seeing and hearing a returning vet discuss his or her difficulty re-entering civilian life is an entirely different experience than reading it.  In our increasingly visual and decreasing literary culture, documentary-styled testimonials will facilitate the communication of important information to those in need.  We would like to add 8-10 documentary video clips to our current website to make the website more engaging and to improve retention of the material that is currently on the website.   This statement of work request includes a description of the work, skills needed, and evaluation criteria for selecting a suitable contractor.DESCRIPTION OF WORK Eight to ten 2-5 minute documentary video clips will be produced in versions that are ready to upload to the website to be viewed by any user without downloading additional software.  These documentary video clips will be produced using an experienced documentary production team that will render a sophisticated and effective product for use on the website.  The product will use compelling human experience to strengthen the viewer's interest in the material.  The Center will provide the necessary research and act as a conduit to the subjects and therefore filming needs to occur within 100 miles of White River Junction, Vermont.  In each segment one returning veteran will be profiled.  The producer will interview each veteran as well as film them in their own environment.  The documentary footage will give life to the interview, add meaning to the face on the screen and keep the information grounded in a real situation.  Each documentary clip will be edited to a viewable length (2-5 minutes) and will be enhanced with state of the art appropriate graphics, archive footage and music for a sophisticated and professional look.  The topics of the clips will include the veteran's experience of readjustment issues, and their experiences of having been treated for PTSD. Specifically, the following areas will be explored by interview with the veteran:Readjustment Issues:a)	Physical and emotional reactionsb)	Behavioral reactionsc)	Family Issuesd)	Work IssuesTreatment:a)	Attitude toward seeking treatmentb)	Experience of being treatedWork Required:"	The contractor will need to have all the skills in order to film, light, produce, edit, enhance with graphics and music, and format a documentary video clip for website"	40 minutes (8-10 video clips) will be produced"	Professional quality audio and video "	Create transcript of audio file and edit.  Transcripts must be 508 compliant.Deliverables:Contractor will provide final materials for 40 minutes of documentary video clips ready to upload to the website.  SKILLS NEEDEDThe contractor needs to be proficient in producing documentary films or video clips, as well as meeting 508 compliant regulations.  National awards or recognition are highly desirable.  The contractor must have the ability to create web-ready video clips compatible with the Center's website.  The contractor should be familiar with VA/Government 508 compliance regulations. If you cannot download the full RFP Document please contact stacy.sullivan@va.gov prior to close of business 3 business days prior to the closing of the RFP.EVALUATION CRITERIAThis contract will be awarded based on the following factors in this order:"	Experience /Technical Ability"	Cost/Price Experience /Technical Ability1)	Demonstrate understanding of all elements involved in this project including:a.	Experience in producing professional documentary films and or video segmentsb.	Experience in creating high quality video films, editing, adding appropriate music and enhancements as requiredc.

Paragraph C.4.2.1. requests that only fiberglass portable toilets be used in the performance of the contract.   Industry standard since 1997 is that toilets are constructed using molded polyethylene plastic.   I am not sure that fiberglass is still available.  Will portable toilets made from plastic be acceptable?<BR>Answer 1.  In the specifications Para. C.4.2.3 it says 'Materials used for the construction of latrines shall be impervious to moisture or be treated with an effective sealer.  All construction joints shall be sealed to prevent any accumulation of filth, reference 15A NCAC 13B.0800.  Molded polyethylene plastic could be used as long as it meets this requirement and has no additional costs incurred with it.<BR>Question 2.  Paragraph C.4.2.10. requests childrens toilets.  What is this and what is your current vendor using?<BR>Answer 2.  The 'children's toilet' is just a smaller unit with a smaller tank.  In the current contract these are included as normal units.  There is also a limit of 5 in the specifications.<BR>Question 3.  Clause 52.222.42-Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires shows a plumber as an equivalent rate for our industry.  A portable toilet service technician does not use the same tools or perform the work of a plumber.  Furthermore, a plumber requires formal training and licensing that our industry does not require.   An equivalent job description would be 99730 Refuse Collector at a rate of $13.30 per hour and $3.24 fringe benefits.  Is this a satisfactory wage grade?<BR>Answer 3.  No.  99730 primarily is for collection and disposal of solid waste.<BR>Question 4.  Clins 1015 and 1016 requests the placement and service of toilets at Lock C.  Where is this and how far is it from main post?<BR>Answer 4.  The distance from post to 'lock C' is approximately 15 miles and it is located off of Lylewood RD near Cumberland City, TN. <BR>Question 5.  What are the locations and gallon capacities of the pit and septic tanks?  <BR>Answer 5.  The pit latrines at range 28 have a holding capacity of 6,598 gallons, Pat Cassidy Mout, 2 each, 1000 gallons and 2500 gallons, RMA, 750 gallons (not in use).  However, contractor shall only be required to recharge the pit latrine with approximately 500 gallons, which will allow the water/chemical level to reach the aerator lines.  Septic tank capacity is 1000 gallons.  The septic tanks locations are Bldg 7138 B Avenue & Black Sheep Run Road; Bldg 9001 Range Control; Bldg 5004 Gate 4; and Bldg 6081 Mabry House off of Mabry Road.<BR>Question 6.  CLIN 0009 and 0011 requests handicap and flushable toilet be provided by the contractor.  What is the unit of issue?  Is this a daily rate?<BR>Answer 6.  The unit of issue is each.  No, it should be a rental rate.  See paragraph C.2.1.37.<BR>Question 7.  CLIN 0007 and CLIN 0008:  What are the locations and gallon capacities of the pit and septic tanks?  <BR>Answer 7.

Is Kennedy Septic your current contractor?<BR>Answer 9.  Yes.<BR>Question 10.  Would forest green color be an acceptable color.  It is acceptable to the Army, National guard, and the Marine Corps?  Limiting color to tan or brown puts the incumbent in an unfair advantage.<BR>Answer 10.  Paragraph C.4.2.1 is changed to read:  Portable latrines provided by the Contractor shall be constructed of preformed fiberglass material and be without cracks, holes, chips, or any other visible damage; latrines shall be constructed of a repairable material.  All hinges, latches, toilet seats, and toilet covers shall be in excellent working condition.

How many toilets are required at any one time. You have 194 permanent toilets out and then it says under clin 0001 220 temporary so is that 416? <BR>Answer 11.  There are approximately 235 permanently set portable latrines and approximately 85  315 temporary set latrines during any given month, for a total of 320 - 550.

<DESC>This Amendment under solicitation W9124R-08-T-1079 is being issued to post a question and answer. Question: Will this Equipment be used outside the U.S.A.? Also, are there any special packaging requirements or UID labeling?  Answer: The equipment will not be used outside of the United States.  No special Unit Identification labeling should be necessary.  It would be good to have the contract number written on the shipment so the warehouse could easily identify the shipment.

FOB Destination shall be Washington, DC 20520<BR><BR>The Department of State requires the following items, Brand Name or Equal, to the following:  <BR>LI 001, Morgana Digifold - Folder: The system is a totally new technology to finish even the most sensitive of materials. The DigiFold is aimed at the print-on-demand market and handles output from digital color printing systems and heavy cross-grained stocks printed by conventional litho. Fully automated, compact and easy to use, the suction-fed DigiFold is the only automated folder using a creasing rule and matrix with the ability to crease material prior to folding. Unlike scoring, which breaks the surface of the material, the creasing rule and matrix mechanism prevents cracking during the folding process.The DigiFold uses a series of very large diameter fold rollers and a 'flying knife' to gently push the material between the fold rollers. A combination of large diameter rollers and the knife, which is speed matched to the material, helps to reduce the possibility of marking or scratching of the finished work. Unit can be used for perfing, scoring and slitting, but it is not fast and thus not recommended.The DigiFold can be set to operate in three modes: For standard folding configurations it works in set to fold mode where, once the required fold and sheet length have been selected, the units powerful program automatically sets the creasing and folding position. A motorized conveyor establishes the optimum position for stacking the finished work. In set to mode, the operator dials in the creasing and folding positions. This mode is particularly useful where extra creases are needed and allows difficult configurations such as the closed gate to be programmed. The third mode of operation allows the DigiFold to be used as an automated creasing machine from which the creased work is delivered flat. Alternatively, the creasing operation can be bypassed and conventionally printed and/or lighter stocks folded. This versatility adds to the printers productivity and ensures maximum utilization of the machine. Specifications:

<DESC>The following are responses to questions received in regards to the subject solicitation:

Question 1. Since the ultimate goal is to have serum, why not produce off the clot serum (or better serum produced by CLSI C37-A) and add the NIST additives to this?  The number of analytes listed for SRM 968 (cholesterol, retinol, retinyl palmitate, alpha tocopherol, trans beta carotene, total beta carotene (trans plus cis isomers), total alpha carotene and lutein as well as non-certified values for tocopherol (includes beta tocopherol, delta tocopherol, zeaxanthin, beta cryptoxanthin, trans-lycopene, trans alpha carotene, total lycopene, 9 cis carotene, 13 plus 15 cis carotene and 15 cis carotene) would mandate caution in how much manipulation of the source material is advisable.  All procedures to convert plasma to serum represent potential matrix effects that could cause variation in analysis among different systems.  This is certainly true at least for cholesterol as demonstrated by the lipid standardization program through the CDC among many other programs.

Answer 1. NIST produced SRMs 968, 968a, 968b, and 968c in house.  Plasma was converted to serum through freeze-thaw cycles and filtration and we have not had commutability issues.  The question raises a good point in that some matrix effects have been seen in SRM 968d, perhaps as a result of the method used for converting the plasma to serum, which was through the addition of bovine thrombin and calcium chloride followed by dialysis and the addition of salts.

Question 2. If plasma must be the starting material, what is the method or chemical used to defeat clotting?  This is probably citrate, but if not it would be helpful to know for any conversion to serum.

Answer 2. Yes, 4% sodium citrate is added.

Question 3. There are a number of ways to convert citrated plasma to serum, the most common being to add calcium to clotting levels.  However, since this is an SRM is there not a standard procedure that the NIST wishes to follow to mimic as closely as possible the preceding SRMs?  If so what is it?

Answer 3. We thaw the frozen plasma and vacuum filter through Whatman 541 filter paper
(or Gelman P1 QUAL MED FLW (part no. 61000), blend and spike if necessary, equilibrate overnight, vacuum filter again as above, and bottle

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; 
(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror’s relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor/Bureau of International Labor Affairs/Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking (OCFT) seeks to enter into Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) on a Firm-Fixed Price basis with one or more organization(s) that can provide the services of highly skilled professionals to conduct evaluations of OCFT-funded projects.

Funding shall be obligated under separate task order(s) during the period of performance of the IDIQ(s) (consisting of five (5) years from date of IDIQ award).  Orders shall be solicited on a task order basis in support of USDOL/ILAB/OCFT.  The following applies:

Note 1 –	IDIQ contract ceiling is $8,000,000.00
Note 2 –	Minimum Task Order amount is $50,000.00
	Maximum Task Order amount is $1,600,000.00

Note 3 –	Up to three (3) IDIQ awards are contemplated, but USDOL reserves the right to award one or none

Task Order #1 will be issued along with the award of the IDIQ(s) in accordance with the included Task Order #1 Statement of Work.  Criteria for award will be specified on individual task orders, but will consist of firm-fixed price services.



The purpose of this contract is to secure the services of highly-skilled independent evaluators to conduct mid-term and final evaluation of OCFT-funded international child labor technical cooperation projects.  The Offeror will be required to provide a continuum of services from the initiation of the evaluations to the production of final reports for distribution.

The contractor will provide highly skilled, independent evaluators to conduct project evaluations to: a) determine if projects are achieving their stated objectives and explain why or why not, b) identify areas of good practices and where project implementation can be improved; c) assess the impact of the projects in term of sustained improvements achieved, d) provide recommendations on how to improve project performance, and e) identify lessons learned to inform future projects. The findings of the evaluations should assist OCFT in its efforts to improve project oversight and take corrective measures as necessary.  

The evaluation services to be performed under this contract shall include the following:

a.	Recruit Evaluator and in-country evaluation and/or support personnel, as needed.  Resumes of a minimum of 3 evaluator candidates should be sent to OCFT for review and writing samples and references should be checked.
b.	Arrange for a pre-evaluation briefing of evaluator by OCFT project managers.
c.	Consult with OCFT and project staff to determine most appropriate methodology to be used to answer the evaluation research questions and present findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
d.	Finalize evaluation Terms of Reference (TOR), after discussions with OCFT and project staff and evaluator.  A standard TOR will include questions relating to project design and implementation, partnership and coordination, management and budget, project sustainability, lessons learned, and good practices.  
e.	Jointly develop evaluation itinerary with evaluator, project staff, and OCFT.  The itinerary will be subject to final approval by OCFT prior to commencement of fieldwork.
f.	Perform all necessary logistical tasks for the evaluation, including travel arrangements, and, as necessary, recruit and sub-contract with in-country support (translator, driver, etc.).
g.	Conduct the evaluation, including a stakeholders meeting at the end of the field research, where the evaluator will present his/her preliminary findings, conclusions, and recommendations and seek stakeholder input.
h.	Write evaluation report addressing research questions included in the Terms of Reference and including findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
i.	Distribute draft report to grantee, OCFT, and key stakeholders, for review and comment. 
j.	Finalizing evaluation report, incorporating comments received from grantees, OCFT, and key stakeholders.

Individual Task Orders to be issued under this contract will contain additional detailed information relating to the projects to be evaluated and other deliverables, such as a summary report, that might be required.


The Contractor(s) will provide all logistical and administrative support for its/their staff and sub-contractors, including travel arrangements (e.g., plane and hotel reservations, purchasing plane tickets, providing per diem), all materials (e.g., access to computers, telecommunications, office supplies) and services (e.g. local translators, translation of draft reports if they are written in a language other than English) needed to provide all deliverables.  The Contractor(s) will also be responsible for providing the management and technical oversight necessary to ensure consistency of methods and technical standards.  ILAB/OCFT will provide information on each project’s geographical target areas to allow for more sound evaluation methodology.  Most projects have funds allocated for external evaluations in their budgets.  In such cases, project funds should be used for costs associated with the evaluator’s in-country transportation (including vehicle, gasoline, and driver costs), translation of the evaluation report from English to the local language for dissemination to key stakeholders, and stakeholder’s meeting expenses (included participant support costs, local transportation, and translation) as budgets permit.  When projects do not have funds allocated for external evaluations, or have limited funds, the Contractor(s) will assume the costs that cannot be covered by the project.  

DELIVERABLES

The Contractor will be provided with a Schedule of Deliverables and other additional instructions as needed for each individual Task Order to be issued under this contract.  
The deliverables will normally include an initial workplan, a quality control plan, individual TORs and itineraries for each project evaluation, a draft evaluation report in a format prescribed by OCFT, and a final evaluation report, to be approved by OCFT prior to final payment.  Task Orders may also require a summary report.

(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

<DESC>BOSS-U Questions (3rd Set)<BR><BR>Question: 1<BR>Reference: RFP Section L__, Paragraph(s) L.1 3) a)___, Page(s) _76___ and Response to Question 14, released with Amendment 2<BR>Question/Comment:  The RFP states that, Type fonts shall be not less than 10 point, except in graphics where it shall be large enough to be legible. Question 14 asks, Do lines of text presented in a table format count against the 45 lines of text per page limit? The response states, No. Font and margin restrictions do apply. Since table content does not count against the lines-of-text restriction, we assume that tables are considered graphics subject to the font and margin restrictions that apply to graphics. Is this correct?<BR><BR>Response 1:  Tables are not considered graphics and as such must comply with minimum font size and page margin restrictions.<BR><BR>Question: 2<BR>Reference: Responses to Question 1 and 31, released with Amendment 2<BR>Question/Comment:  Question 1 references the instructions in Section L that state, Foldouts shall not exceed 5 per Volume and are considered two pages for each foldout counted toward the volume maximum page count.  The response to Question 1 states that, The following language counted toward the volume maximum page count has been removed from L.1.3.  The response to Question 31 says, The referenced language has been revised.  Foldouts will count toward the page count. It appears that one response counts the foldout pages against the maximum volume page count and the other removes the language that makes the foldouts part of the page count. Is page count determined by adding the 5 foldouts (10 pages) to the maximum page count for the volume (e.g. 50 pages for Technical plus 10 pages of foldout material) or by including the foldouts in the maximum volume page count (e.g. 50 pages for Technical which includes no more than 10 pages of foldout material)? The first example permits a total of 60 pages of material if all foldouts are used. The second permits a total of 50 pages of material whether foldouts are used or not.<BR><BR>Response 2:  Each page of incorporated foldouts will be counted toward the maximum page count for that section.<BR><BR>Question: 3<BR>If you deem this RFP primarily as a requirement for commercial items, then FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal RequirementsCommercial Item should apply. Contrarily, FAR 52.216-29 should apply for the competitive acquisition of Non-Commercial Items.Our initial understanding was that the BOSS-U program was a DoD contract that would required the successfulofferor to use commercial available tools to achieve contract objectives. Based on our review of the solicitation, we believe that theRFP should be amended to includeFAR 52-216-29. Under FAR 52.216-29, offeror may propose blended rates in response to government solicitations. However, FAR 52.216-31 Time-and-Materials/Labor-Hour Proposal RequirementsCommercial Item Acquisition requires offerors to identify for each proposed labor hour rate whether the rate applies tothe prime contractor employees, subcontractor or affiliated division.<BR><BR>Thanks in advance for your assistance. Our goal is to submit a fully compliant and responsive proposal in response to the referenced solicitation. Please provide clarification at your earliest convenience.<BR><BR>Response 3:<BR>Offerors should submit a single loaded labor rate for each labor category contained in Attachment J-4 (Price Table).  This acquisition is not strictly T&M.  The contract will allow for FFP, T&M, and Cost Reimbursble CLINs so that Task Orders issued can be either FFP, T&M, or Cost Reimbusable or even a hybrid.  This acquisition will comply with FAR 52.216-31.  This contract will not be for non-commercial items and thus FAR 52.216-29 doesnt apply.  Note: The loaded hourly rates are ceiling price rates and the Contractor may, at its discretion, elect to propose lower hourly rates on a task by task basis<BR><BR>

<DESC>HSCG87-08-B-643406 – Repair Heating Systems at U.S. Coast Guard Housing, Homer, Alaska. The intent of this project is to repair the heating systems in four housing buildings at the United States Coast Guard Housing Area in Homer, Alaska.  Each of the four housing buildings has two ground-floor units where work will occur; eight units in total will be repaired.  The current heating system is a single-loop, boiler heated, hot water fin tube hydronic system.  Each unit has an independent loop controlled by a single thermostat.  The loop is fed from a central boiler room via copper tubing imbedded in the concrete slab-on-grade floor.  The imbedded piping has begun to show signs of failure and will be replaced with in-wall piping.  Work includes: installing a new in-wall piping heating loop in each housing unit . Part of the new loop will be installed in front of the existing walls, and part will be installed in concealed wall spaces that consist of standard wood framed exterior walls and furred out foundation walls.  Selective demolition will be required.; disconnecting the existing fin tube heaters from the in-slab loop and connecting them to the new in-wall loop; replacing the covers for the existing fin tube heaters and extending most covers to adjacent wall corners;  patching all areas of demolition; and painting and finishing to match existing conditions.  Each unit has a bedroom with an improperly sized fin tube heater; each of these shall be replaced with a new, larger fin tube heater and new cover. In 3 of the units, temporary repair piping has been mounted on the unit walls.  This shall be demolished and disposed of.  Testing and balancing of the new system.  The estimated start work date is early to mid-October 2008, with a performance period of 90 calendar days.  The estimated cost range is between $25,000 and $100,000.  See the solicitation for bonding requirements.  Award of this project is contingent upon availability of funding.  This project is being advertised as a 4th fiscal quarter FY2008 project with award anticipated prior to 9/30/08 if sufficient funding is available.  However, award may be delayed until 1st fiscal quarter FY09 (period beginning 10/01/08) funding becomes available.  This procurement is issued as a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238220 and the applicable size standard is $13.0 million dollars in annual receipts for the past three years.  All responsible small businesses may submit a bid. This solicitation will not be issued in paper form.
