<CONTACT>Hillary G. Strickland, Contract Specialist, Phone 4783277141, Email hillary.strickland@us.af.mil
<DESC><p align="left">The product required is the Inverter/Control Assembly Test Set (P/N: 16U4255-1, NSN: 4920-01-097-0452). The test set consists of circuits to functionally test and isolate faults of the inverter/control assembly which consists of a battery control unit, and inverter, and a NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set monitors power inputs from aircraft essential dc buses 1 and 2 and, in the event of loss of these inputs, automatically switches to output of the emergency generator converter unit. In the event the voltage of these power inputs is less than the battery voltage, the inverter will switch to the flight control inverter battery assembly as a source of power. The test set simulates these signals to the inverter/control assembly and monitors outputs of the assembly. The inverter/control assembly can be tested with or without the NI-CAD battery assembly. The test set will simulate both a good and malfunctioning battery assembly. Surplus is acceptable as long as it is new or reconditioned. As long as the equipment is fully functional and operates according to instructions in T.O. 8C3-11-3-7-1, surplus equipment in either state is acceptable.</p>

<DESC>The objective of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project is to address the impacts of historical dredge mining on aquatic habitat conditions. The Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation project was designed to be constructed in 4 - 6 Phases with associated work designed as Optional Items. The Phases include building a bypass channel, rebuilding floodplain and river channel, and adding large wood structures. Phase 1 Bypass work was completed in 2016, Phase 2 Bypass work was completed in 2017 and large section of floodplain was treated in 2017 (designed as an Optional Item). The project is being performed on the Red River Ranger District of the Nez Perce Clearwater National Forests in collaboration with the Nez Perce Tribe Watershed Program and funded by Bonneville Power Administration. The project area is located approximately 45 mi east of Grangeville, Idaho. At the junction of Highway 14 and the Crooked River Road (FR 233), travel south for approximately 0.25 mile to the project area. <br /><br />This contract requires completion of Phase 1 of the Crooked River Valley Rehabilitation Project. Phase 1 requires construction of 300 feet of bypass channel, construction of a diversion structure and activating one section of the previously built bypass channel. The contractor shall install a temporary bridge, re-grade approximately 22 acres of floodplain, import fill material from an existing staging area, and construct 4,200 feet of new river channel with pools, riffles and channel features. During channel construction, riverbed fill and stream bank material may need to be sorted or screened to meet gradation specifications if suitable material is not found.
<p>The floodplain re-grading will require moving and reshaping approximately 50,200 cubic yards of mine tailings on site and importing approximately 6,200 cubic yards of tailings from the staging area to meet grading requirements and final floodplain slope. Depressions, swales, side channel and wetland features shall also be constructed. Unsuitable floodplain material shall be sorted if necessary to meet proper material gradations. Slash salvaged from the work area and already stockpiled at the staging area will be spread on approximately 10 acres of floodplain to provide roughness.</p>
<p>Government lead fish salvage operations will occur in over one mile of river channel and within approximately 20 existing pools. The government estimates that this operation will take approximately 5 days. The Contractor shall assist the government in its fish salvage efforts by reducing flows in the main stem of Crooked River, pumping large pools, and maintaining low turbidity levels. In addition, the contractor shall excavate the plug to the bypass channel and construct a temporary diversion structure to reduce flow in the main channel.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform survey and construction staking incidental to the work items required. The contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, structures, supervision, transportation, operating supplies (except those designated at Government-furnished), and incidentals necessary to complete the project as required by the contract, plans, and specifications.</p>
<p>An additive bid item will be included to solicit prices for the construction of large woody debris structures. Award of this work will be made concurrent with award of the base items of work; the number of structures awarded under this item shall be dependent on the funds available but would not exceed 20 structures.</p>
<p>The Government's construction estimate is between $500,000 and $1,000,000. A formal pre-bid tour will be held; details will be provided in the solicitation. It is anticipated that the full solicitation with complete technical specifications and drawings shall be issued in mid-April. Construction work shall commence approximately July 1, 2018; all work shall be completed by October 31, 2018. All in-stream work to dewater the main channel and activate the bypass channel shall be performed after July 15, 2018.</p>
<p>Original bid bonds will be required. The acquisition has been set-aside for small businesses.</p>

<DESC>NASA MSFC has a requirement&nbsp;for an increase in level&nbsp;of&nbsp;support services for the Office of Human Capital (OHC).&nbsp; NASA/MSFC intends to increase the Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quanity (IDIQ) Ceiling Value by $2.3M&nbsp; for Aetos&nbsp;Systems, Inc.&nbsp;The period of performance through May 31, 2019 is unchanged.&nbsp; &nbsp;The authority&nbsp;for this increase is&nbsp;pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for the acquisition of supplies and services from only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.<br /><br />The OHCSS firm-fixed price and IDIQ contract provides services&nbsp;and materials for training and development, travel, visiting researchers, grant coordination, workshops, exhibit planning, internship support, education resources, informal education opportunities, and strategic, operational and admnistrative support across the spectrum of the human capital discipline.&nbsp; <br /><br />Competition is impractical for the following reasons:<br /><br />Aetos Systems, Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform&nbsp;this scope&nbsp;and will continue to provide a variety of key support services to MSFC management, programs, projects, organizations and academic/education related activities and ancillary subcontracts across the broad spectrum of the human capital discipline area in its strategic, operational, and administrative roles at MSFC. Procurement of these services from another source other than Aetos Systems, Inc. would result in unacceptable delays in fullfilling the Agency's requirements.<br /><br />The Government does not intend to afquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.<br /><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency.<br /><br />NASA Clause 1852.215.84, Ombudsman, is applicable.&nbsp; The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/</a>pub/publibrary/Omb.html<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<CONTACT>Douglas H. Reed
Contracting Officer

<a href="mailto:douglas.reed3@va.gov">douglas.reed3@va.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source purchase order to the following contractor for Reconfigure of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Boom service in support of Iowa City VA Health Care System, 601 Highway 6 West, Iowa City, IA 52246-2209:

The Rhino Group
DUNS: 806498226
7605 Park Drive
Ralston, NE 68127

This is done under authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1)(i): Exclusive Licensing Agreement. 

This is not a request for competitive quotes.

Market research revealed that Skytron is the manufacturer of the ICU boom and has proprietary rights over its equipment, including who they choose to have as authorized dealer (The Rhino Group) for the region encompassing Iowa City, IA.

Service must be provided by a company that is authorized by Skytron to install and/or modify their products.  Skytron booms are FDA regulated medical devices, and the reconfiguration work has to be coordinated with Skytron s design team.

Because the work has to be completed by a company that is authorized by Skytron, no other company besides The Rhino Group Inc. can perform this work.  Skytron delegates all services to their regional distributors.  The regional distributors have non-compete agreements with each other, so therefore The Rhino Group Inc. is the only company that can perform this work for Skytron in Iowa City, IA.
Skytron delegates their services to Rhino Group via non-compete agreement for Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota; no other authorized Skytron distributor would able to quote or work on this service due to such non-compete agreements in effect.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this service is 339112 (Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing) and the Product Service Code (PSC) is J065 (Maintenance and Repair of Medical, Dental, and Veterinary).

While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement, including documentation from the proprietary rights holder Skytron that such contractor could provide this service as an authorized dealer. 

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 10:00am Central Standard Time (CST), 3-6-2018, which shall be considered by the agency, by e-mailing such statement and supporting documentation to Doug Reed, Contracting Officer, at douglas.reed3@va.gov. No phone calls please. Please indicate  Response to ISS ICU Boom  in subject line of e-mail.

Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government under authorities cited above.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">2.1. Program Description<br />The C-5M Super Galaxy aircraft's primary mission is to provide strategic airlift in support of the United States Air Force's peace and war time missions. The C-5M users are represented by the Air Mobility Command (AMC), and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). At this time there are no current or planned international operators of this weapons system.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The C-5M CNS/ATM Upgrade consists of several avionics modifications to the C-5M Super Galaxy to include: upgrades to the ARC-210 radios and Cryptographic LRUs, and an upgrade of legacy voice civilian SATCOM equipment. These modifications are required due to multiple civil and federal mandates required for access to preferred airspace and will additionally be used to mediate obsolescence issues. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) portion of the program is currently performed by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics of Marietta, Georgia. The EMD program will provide technical documentation (TDP and Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)) to be utitlized under the Production Program. The software upgrade of APX-119 LRUs is expected to occur prior and outside of the scope of this RFI. Production installations are expected to be performed by WR ALC, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. The Production Program will need to acquire, produce and deliver modification kits to WR ALC to support the installations from Jun 2020 through 2023. On-time, defect free kit arrival is an important program priority, enabling the production line schedule of the fifty (50) aircraft.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />2.2.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited. <br /><br />The 422nd Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No qualification requirements exist. Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation, Cage: 99167 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications. <br /><br />The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 335999, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1,500 employees. The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.

<p>This SSN is for information and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey.

<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Office of the Chief of Public Affairs (OCPA), is designated by the Secretary of the Army (SECARMY) as the executive agency with administrative and performance oversight of the United States (U.S.) Army's strategic communication.  The OCPA is responsible for providing internal (U.S. Army) and external (the public) audiences with up-to-date and accurate information. Doing so maintains confidence in the Army and its readiness to conduct operations.  The OCPA launched the Digital Media Division (DMD) in 2009 to disseminate news and information to online and mobile audiences in order to shape conditions that enhance trust and confidence in the U.S. Army. The DMD executes the Army's social media program and manages the Army's primary social media presences on various online platforms to include, but not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram.  The DMD is responsible for managing daily operations of the Army's official flagship social media presences while also synchronizing the messaging and content publishing across the Army's entire digital footprint.  The DMD provides Army leadership with performance analytics of social media content in order to improve future efforts.</p>
<p>As the DMD works to expand the U.S. Army's digital footprint, assistance is needed to support accurate dissemination of Army communication. The DMD has a requirement for a social media planning and management solution to provide Army social media managers with a common operating picture of Army social media operations.  This solution shall enhance communication and collaboration amongst DMD and Army social media managers.</p>
<p>This will aid in protecting the Army's online reputation by mitigating fake accounts, also known as impostor accounts, of Army senior leaders on social media.  A comprehensive plan for discovery, reporting, and removal verification for impostor accounts are required.  This effort defines an impostor social media account/profile as any user account portraying another person or entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.  Accounts that use similar usernames, or are just similar in appearance, are not impostor accounts, nor are accounts that have profiles that clearly state they are not affiliated, or connected, with the similarly named individual.</p>

<DESC>DLA Troop Support is seeking industry feedback from interested parties concerning the manufacturing of the Rapid In-theatre Deployment (RAID 7H) NSN 5450-99-821-3761. <br />The RAID 7H is a patented storage and release container which was developed to reduce the logistical burden of supporting force protection missions on expeditionary operations, such as the construction of forward operating and patrol bases. The RAID 7H utilizes a specially designed and engineered ISO container that conforms to all ISO stacking and transportation standards and this patented configuration has the potential to remove 50% of all road traffic involved in delivering defensive barriers to the end-user. With a purposely designed release mechanism to allow the rapid deployment of pre-joined standard or recoverable MIL units, RAID 7H enables curves and corners to be easily formed. Some or all of the contents of the container can be dispensed with one continuous stream. The RAID 7H system was developed to deploy over a 1000 feet of MIL 7 in under 60 seconds. Additional units can be joined to create vast boundary walls or perimeters with entry control points.
<p>Besides the OEM, there is no known alternate source that has the capability to produce the RAID 7H system. Hesco Bastion LTD developed this item and owns the complete technical data rights. This information is proprietary and the Government does not possess the detailed technical documentation that describes all required form, fit, and function characteristics of this item.</p>

If your organization has the potential and is interested in providing these services, please complete the information below and provide responses to Venson Wilkins via email at venson.wilkins@va.gov  
BASED ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE/MARKET RESEARCH, THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE FOR SDVOSB, VOSB, SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.

SYNOPSIS OF REQUIREMENT:
Nursing home facilities in the Community Nursing Home (CNH) program shall ensure that care meets the health needs and promotes the maximum well-being of VA patients.  Nursing home care will be furnished to ensure the total medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of VA beneficiaries.  All nursing home facilities in VA s CNH program must have current Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) certification (Medicare and/or Medicaid) and a State nursing home license.  VA developed quality of care standards utilizing CMS inspection criteria that are followed by VA in its selection of nursing homes which includes exclusionary criteria on which the CNH is evaluated.  See VHA Handbook 1143.2,  VHA Community Nursing Home Oversight Procedures (June 4, 2004) a copy of which is available at:   http://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?pub=2. VA often has a particular need for specialty care services in the CNH program. The VA requires CNHs to have bed capacity to ensure their ability to take referrals when requested.  The CNH also must be able to accept VA referrals in a timely fashion (ideally within 24 hours of request). Provider visits will be available at the rate of one (1) visit per month. Laboratory, x-ray, and other special services will be available to VA patients as needed.  In addition, the care provided will include room, meals, nursing care, and other services or supplies commensurate with the VA-authorized level of care, without extra charge.  Duly authorized representatives of VA will provide quality oversight visits to veterans placed to assure continuity of care and to assist in the veterans  transition back into the community.  These visits do not substitute nor relieve the CNH in any way of the responsibility for the daily care and medical treatment of the veteran.  The per diem rate(s) established in this IDC will include the cost of primary medical care, one (1) provider visit per month and needed consultation, drugs and routine supplies, laboratory, x-ray, and other special services authorized by VA, unless otherwise specifically excepted.  Full attention shall be given to motivating and educating patients to achieve and maintain independence in the activities of daily living.  Every effort shall be made to keep patients ambulatory and to achieve an optimal level of self-care.

Looking for a facility outside the medical centers catchment areas is not feasible because Veteran beneficiaries will normally be measured, fitted, and accept delivery of their prosthesis at the contractor s facility.

The second known constraint is that in accordance with VA policy, VAMC staff cannot recommend or force any Veteran to choose a particular vendor.  At the time of clinic visit, Veterans will be presented with selected vendors to choose from for his/her artificial limb. All vendors who have contracts are allowed to market their products directly to the patients (Veterans) in the clinic. Â  VAMC staff will present the selected contractor options to the Veterans. Veteran may choose any one of these vendors. Because of VAMC staff does not have authority to prescribe a specific vendor to Veteran VAMC cannot guarantee minimum number of orders per year or the dollar amount per year.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B112, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640.
<p>Background and General Requirements:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks to procure the services of stationary engineers qualified to operate boilers and gas steam turbines at its campus in Gaithersburg, MD. The contractor shall provide all the necessary skilled labor and supervisory direction necessary to supply NIST with shift stationary engineers covering three (3) sequential 8-hour shifts per 24-hour period (7 to 3, 3 to 11 and 11 to 7) to ensure the safe operation of NIST's Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP) and Industrial Boiler.</p>
<p>Period of Performance:<br />The base period to be covered is anticipated to be six (6) months. It is anticipated that the requirement will include nine (9) separate sequential six-month optional periods, that, if exercised, would take the contract out to a total maximum period of five (5) years. It is anticipated that an award will be made by August 2018.</p>
<p>Qualifications:<br />Minimum experience to meet the qualification for each stationary engineer is one (1) year as an independent operator.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:<br />This requirement will have operators working set shifts that coincide with the NIST shift rotation. With NIST oversight (not supervision), the operators shall perform a variety of duties to support the CHP and boiler. They would be responsible for the operation and routine maintenance (as performed during shift) of four (4) high pressure steam generators (generating 44,000 pounds of steam per hour at 150 psi), two (2) high pressure steam generators (generating 80,000 pounds of steam per hour at 150 psi), four (4) centrifugal electric motor driven air compressors (furnishing compressed air at 110 psi) and one (1) gas CHP turbine generator (generating 8 MW and 80,000 pounds of steam per hour).</p>
<p>Typical operation duties would include, but are not necessarily limited to the following; maintaining the correct steam pressure and water level in the steam generators by proper operation of the control system; inspecting feed water regulatory controls and gauges; ensuring proper combustion by maintaining the required O2 levels in the exit gasses; maintaining an established chemical program by performing tests and adding the required chemicals to each system and adjusting system blow down rates; operation of all auxiliary equipment associated with steam generation; maintaining correct air pressure by proper adjustments to the air compressors.</p>
<p>Typical maintenance duties would include, but are not necessarily limited to the following; troubleshooting, repair, and preventative maintenance of all equipment that provides steam, and compressed air found in the steam and chilled water generation plant; measuring, cutting and threading pipe, and cleaning the water and fire sides of the steam generators; troubleshooting and repairing control issues associated with direct digital, pneumatic and electric controls; and repacking valves and performing pump repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>NIST will require each operator to cross-train for a minimum of two (2) weeks prior to being responsible for independent operation. This will afford them the opportunity to ask questions of the NIST operators and shift supervisor, to learn NIST standard operating procedures and to become familiar with the NIST plant. Acknowledging that personnel may be replaced over the course of the contract by the contractor, NIST will pay for overlap periods of training for up to eight (8) operators during the contract period. If more than eight (8) operators are required to be trained to meet the contractual requirements, the contractor shall bear all expenses associated with training such additional personnel.</p>
<p>NIST will retain the right to request an operator be replaced if NIST finds the operator not to be performing his or her duties satisfactorily, to be working in an unsafe manner or to be consistently tardy or not at his or her appointed place of duty.</p>
<p>Operators are required to report to work with all required safety equipment to perform their duties. These items include but are not limited to: hard hat, hearing protection, eye protection, hand protection and safety shoes.</p>
<p>All meals will be taken on site and at the respective operator's appointed control booth. NIST has a small kitchen area for meal prep and storage while on shift.</p>
<p>Security:<br />NIST is a federal facility and access is controlled at all entrances to the campus. Only Government employees may grant access to non-government employees. All non-government employees must be registered with security prior to site access. Contractor shall notify the NIST contracting officer's representative (COR) a minimum of 48 hours prior to site access. For all personnel requiring access to the NIST campus, Contractor shall provide the COR with first and last names, country of citizenship, and whether the individual possesses a permanent resident alien visa. If any individuals are in the United States on a work visa, they will need to complete a NIST 1260 form and return it to the COR.</p>
<p>Due to security requirements, NIST will require each of the operators to have a background check to receive a NIST badge. This process takes more than one month. Keep this timeframe in mind when selecting operators to mitigate problems associated with personnel turnover in order to meet your prospective contractual obligations of providing operators each day.</p>
<p>NAICS: 561210 - Facilities Support Services (Small Business Size Standard of $38.5M).</p>
<p>Companies that are interested in this notice are encouraged to submit information setting forth specific capability to meet this requirement, by email, to dennis.bailey@nist.gov by 3:00PM EST on Friday, March 9, 2018.</p>
<p>Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: <br />1. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.<br />2. Whether your company currently holds one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). <br />3. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS NOTICE IS RELEASED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT SEEK A QUOTATION, BID, OR PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT BOUND IN ANY WAY TO RELEASE A SOLICITATION BUT SEEKS RESPONSES IN ORDER TO FURTHER DEVELOP ITS REQUIREMENT.

In addition, the animals must be research naive, physically sound and healthy, free of wounds, external parasites, and clinical signs of disease prior to shipment.  No animal shall be shipped to the NIH or other designated facility that has a history of illness without the prior approval of the COR.  A record of each individual animal shall accompany shipment to include sire and dam, date of birth, sex, and all medical records of clinical tests and results, treatments, and physical exams including body conditioning score. An electronic copy of the medical record shall be submitted to the COR not later than 5 business days prior to shipment for review and approval. All animals shall be identified by individual tattoo numbers, placed on the chest of the animal.</p>
<p>Prior to arrival all animals shall have no record of a positive TB test and shall have been TB tested a minimum of three times, one within 15 days of shipment, test negative at minimum of one (1) time for Herpes B virus, SRV1, SRV2, SRV5, SIV and STLV-I  by serology and test negative one (1) time for SRV1, SRV2, and SRV5 by PCR. Animals shall be returned to the vendor and replaced at the vendors cost if animals convert to any of the above-mentioned diseases within 35 days after receipt by the NIH. The diagnostic laboratories used shall be approved by the COR prior to performing the required testing. No animal that must be tested for filo-virus shall be accepted under this contract, unless the contractor pays for testing required to comply with Center for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, and the animal's cohort group test results are seronegative.  Once an animal has been designated for the NIH and vaccinations are required by the vendor, all vaccines must be approved by the COR to ensure there will be no impact to the intended research.

All animals shall be delivered in a physically sound and healthy condition and shall be free of wounds, external parasites and clinical signs of disease.  Animals with clinical signs of disease will be rejected.  Only animals judged healthy based on an examination by a veterinarian during the entry physical, which will be performed within seven (7) days after arrival, will be acceptable.  This judgment will be based on a physical examination and observation of the animal's general appearance and state of nutrition.  Animals judged as unacceptable will be returned to the contractor at no expense to the Government, euthanized at the contractor's discretion, or the contractor may allow appropriate treatment by the Government to render the delivered animals acceptable, with all such cost to be borne by the contractor as a credit to the Government.</p>
<p>Animals will not be accepted from the vendor whose colony(s) are experiencing reportable diseases as defined by the CDC (yellow fever, monkey pox, hemorrhagic fevers [filo-virus or others]) or mortality or morbidity of greater than 5% for a cohort group of animals without the prior approval of the COR.

Scope of project:
Provide labor and materials to demolish and renovate approximately 11,000 SF of existing Emergency Department and Clinic space into a state of the art Emergency Department. A new divided entrance will be constructed that will more clearly define wayfinding for visitors and patients and reduce confusion for those arriving for emergent and outpatient care. The new ED will be arranged around a central nursing core with treatment areas around the perimeter. Treatment areas will include two (2) trauma/life support bays, and six (6) treatment rooms including an isolation room, a gynecological room, and two (2) seclusion holding rooms.  In order to achieve the centralized nursing arrangement, an existing 2 story stair will be relocated from the interior of the department to an exterior wall, which requires constructing an egress corridor and stairway penthouse on the roof above the ED. Construction of project will be required to be phased. The first phase consists of beginning work on the building addition projects (stair, canopy/entrance, decontam room) while constructing half of the new ED. The current emergency dept. will remain operational for the entire project, functioning out of its existing space during the first phase, and then switch to the new side to operate until the remainder of the department is renovated. The project includes work on all building systems. A new air handling unit will be installed for the renovated spaces, located in the basement mechanical room. Most building systems connect to existing systems in the basement.
In accordance with VAAR 836.204, the estimated magnitude of the resulting construction price range is estimated to be between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, small business size standard of $36.5M in average annual receipts for the preceding three years. Interested firms must be registered in https: www.SAM.gov  and qualified as a small business under this NAICS code.

<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice is not a Request for Proposals or a Solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  This notice is not a commitment from the Government.  The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal cost as a result of this notice.

<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is hosting a Vendor Webinar Event on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 from 1-2pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) to provide pertinent details regarding a new fiscal year 2018 procurement, "Design and Conduct of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2022-23 (ECLS-K:2023) Contract," for the Departments' Institute for Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The Department's intent is to host a Webinar during which interested parties and prospective offerors can obtain key information on the requirement, to allow for a robust understanding of the respective requirement in its entirety, to obtain valuable feedback from industry, and to provide a platform whereby both large and small businesses may obtain the information on other interested parties to support robust small business subcontracting opportunities, partnering, and/or teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>Attachments to this notice are as follows:<br />Attachment A - Draft Performance Work Statement <br />Attachment B - Capability Statement Instructions</p>
<p>A brief overview of the requirement and logistical information for the Vendor Collaboration Webinar Event is provided below:</p>
<p>Requirements Overview</p>
<p>The Department intends to award a contract in FY 2018 for a large, complex data collection, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2022-23 (ECLS-K:2023). The contract will design and conduct data collections for the preschool, kindergarten, first-grade, and third-grade years, as well as the design of the fifth-grade year, of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2022-23 (ECLS-K:2023). The ECLS-K:2023 will be the fourth cohort in the series of early childhood longitudinal studies that began with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) and continued with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (ECLS-K:2011). The purpose of the ECLS-K:2023 will be to provide important information on children's early learning and development, preschool/early care and education experiences, transition into kindergarten, and progress through the elementary grades, building upon knowledge acquired from the previous Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies. The ECLS-K:2023 will collect data about the child and the child's early care and education environment, school, classroom, teacher(s), before- and after-school care providers, and family. Information must be collected directly from the child (including through the use of direct cognitive assessments with the children in reading and math, and in the later rounds, child questionnaires), the child's parents/guardians, teachers, and school administrators.</p>
<p>This requirement consists of the following overall activities: 1) recruit children, families, and schools in order to follow the progress of the cohort as it moves from preschool through the third grade; 2) develop the parent interviews for all rounds of the ECLS-K:2023; 3) develop the teacher questionnaires and school administrator questionnaires for the kindergarten, first-grade, third-grade, and fifth-grade years; 4) field test the assumptions for the preschool collection, such as sample movement into kindergarten schools; 5) field test the direct cognitive assessments in the domains of reading and math (or some other domain as agreed up by NCES) to be conducted in all rounds except for preschool; 6) field test the non-assessment instruments for all ECLS-K:2023 rounds; 7) develop and field test the third- and fifth-grade child questionnaires; 8) plan and conduct the preschool (spring 2022), kindergarten (fall 2022 and spring 2023), first-grade (spring 2024), and third-grade (spring 2026) national data collections; 9) create restricted-use and public-use data files containing all data collected from rounds through the third grade, along with associated documentation; and 10) update child locating information (e.g., home address and telephone number, last school attended) at least annually to allow children to be followed over time.</p>
<p>Period of Performance<br />The period of performance for the anticipated contract period is 120 months.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: 91990018R0012<br />NAICS Code: 541720 (Research and Development in the Social Sciences and Humanities)<br />Anticipated Acquisition Strategy: Full and Open Competition<br />Anticipated Contract Type: Cost Reimbursement</p>
<p>ECLS-K:2023 Vendor Webinar details are provided below:</p>
<p>WEBINAR REGISTRATION:<br />All interested parties please register by sending an email noting their company name, size &amp; socioeconomic standards; number of attendees; and number of phone lines that will be participating in the Webinar to the Contract Specialist (pavan.mehrotra@ed.gov) by 12 noon EST, Friday, March 9, 2018.</p>
<p>Information on how to join the webinar will be posted here as soon as it is available.</p>

<DESC>This is a notification of DLA Aviation's intention to bundle approximately 2,261 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) into a procurement for TF34 Engine performance based supply chain management support. SPE4A2-17-R-SCC3 is the planned solicitation number and is being used for notice identification; however, no solicitation is available at this time. This holistic project is expected to be a single contract action with General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines. This proposed procurement action meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely to be unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified.
<p>DLA Aviation has determined that measurably substantial benefits are expected to be derived as a result of the bundling as defined at FAR 7.107. The expected benefits of this bundling are listed in FAR 7.107-3 and summarized below:</p>
<p>1) Cost Savings<br />2) Price Reduction<br />3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency<br />4) Reduction of acquisition cycle times<br />5) Better terms and conditions<br />6) Anticipated quantified savings of at least five (5) percent of the estimated contract value including options</p>

<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center intends to execute it's option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend services of the Advanced Research Technology Support (ARTS) contract, NNC13BA10B.&nbsp; This extension is required to ensure continuity of services required while a full competitive procurement is concluded for award of the next contract. The ARTS contract is a cost-plus fixed-fee (CPFF) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with Universities Space Research Associates (USRA) for specialized research services.&nbsp; During the award of the contract, pricing for the option was not evaluated - therefore this synopsis is required.&nbsp; However, this extension does not add any value to the IDIQ as the value of Task Orders has not exceeded the contract maximum.&nbsp; The pricing of each Task Order being extended has been determined fair and reasonable as they are based upon the&nbsp;rates for&nbsp;Option Period 4, which was determined Fair and Reasonable at award of the contract. <br /><br />Execution of the FAR 52.217-8&nbsp;Option will extend the term of the contract from March 31, 2018 to September 30, 2018.&nbsp;

<DESC>This is a Sole Source notification. A written solicitation will not be issued. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB), intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) purchase order to Jeff Murray's Programming Shop, Inc. (jProg), to support CAREWare Software Operations and Maintenance.
<p>CAREWare software has evolved into a comprehensive electronic health information system that has now become the source of over half of the Bureau's year-end data submitted by Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipients and providers of HIV care. The software has become central to the monitoring and evaluation activities of many recipients, and in a number of jurisdictions, is run on a full network across entire states or cities, allowing for data sharing across agencies and importing data from outside systems. In 2018-19, CAREWare will be updated to a new structure with a browser-based user interface. The new front end will modernize the look and feel of the application and introduce a number of efficiencies.</p>
<p>jProg is uniquely positioned for the work because jProg, has copyright license to specific components of the software. Only the services offered by jProg can meet HAB's needs due to their unique, long-term experience, and that firm's copyright to specific features, functions and algorithms in CAREWare. No other organization would be able to meet HRSA's needs due to the unique "ownership" of the underlying software code. <br /><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.501(a). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested offerors may submit their capabilities or responses before the closing date and time of this notice to the Government for consideration. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.</p>

The subject solicitation will be processed under FAR Part 13.<br /><br /></span>SWRMC requires procurement and delivery of various Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) direct replacement parts in support of SWRMC EPF Diesel Shop 931 at Naval Base San Diego.  The required OEM direct replacement parts are as follows; one (1) governor test stand Model 8909-1057 (5 HP/3.7 kw), one (1) drive -4:1 speed increaser, one (1) gear drive, one (1) test stand gauge kit (0-125 IN HG, 8.5 inches, L.H. Heise), one (1) test stand gauge kit (0-100 IN HG, 8.5 inches, R.H. Heise), one (1) SG/PSG test stand adapter kit, one (1) EGB2 governor drive adapter kit, one (1) DC power supply kit.<br /><br />Brand Name Sole Source Justification - The Woodward governor test stand is compatible to the Fairbanks Morse small engine Governor injection pumps already onboard the ships serviced by the Diesel Governor and Injector Shop 931. The instruction manual and written guidance that states the Governor test stand MUST be a Woodward Governor test stand is local Tech Authority approval in ESR 16-01367, TSP-14188, and Maintenance standard S9233-DM-HBK-010 Rev 1, NSTM 233, S9311-C2-MMC-010/3161, EGB-10P/EGB/EGB-35P and Manual 82340.<br /></div>
<div>Furthermore, the Tech Authority grants SWMRC the certification to test governors using the OEM approved processes and procedures only due to being a "Critical" system. OEM Support: Woodward controls and control devices are installed into the equipment system and programmed by an OEM or Equipment Packager at their factory. The programming is password-protected by the OEM, and they are the sole source for product service and support. This is due to proprietary rights owned by SEMT and Fairbanks Morse Engine.<br /><br />
<div>This requirement must be brand name sole source as another brand will not be compatible.&nbsp; Other brand tests stands available from the vendors do not meet the proprietary requirements from Fairbanks Morse Engine nor have they been granted the capability to test Woodward brand governor&rsquo;s test stands. The testing of governors is on the "critical" systems list and controlled work packages will be used to complete final availability certification after testing is completed.</div>

 STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)

Purpose:

This Statement of Work is presented, as requested, to launch Break Through Learning for the Friday Night at the ER team-learning simulation to support a need to broadly teach leaders/employees to think systemically, to collaborate across functional boundaries to achieve system goals. The concept is to create an experiential learning tool that would engage employees in a learning process; simulate and illustrate dynamics that are common to complex systems, and promote an understanding of key systems principles in a way that enables people to gain insight about their relevance.  Since its initial release in 1992, simulation has met diverse learning needs and served a wide range of objectives beyond this initial purpose. The VA Michael E. DeBakey Medical Center setting is familiar to nearly everyone. People who work in other industries or live in diverse cultures readily understand the core processes and interdependencies that simulation represents and find them universally relevant. 

Goal:

The Friday Night at the ER simulation is versatile- useful to employees with varied levels of knowledge, adaptable to suit a variety of specific objectives and suitable with small or large groups. Improve collaboration across care/service lines, prepare groups for a major change initiative, clarify success factors and support leadership development in areas such as self-directed work teams, customer satisfaction, conflict management, change management and team building.

Description:  

The BREAKTHROUGH LEARNING offers a solution to prepare leader(s) to successfully use the Friday Night at the ER simulation with an opportunity to practice concepts and procedures, as well as provide an opportunity to practice analysis, problem solving, fault detection and correction, and decision-making within instructional environments that appropriately align with desired learning outcomes. This approach is to get leaders or training staff up to speed with best practices.

The Friday Night at the ER experience has proven useful for meeting a variety of team- building needs. The shared experience can bring together individuals who have not worked together. Certainly, one of the fundamental principles taught by the simulation is that individuals in a system are interdependent, and individual performance is enhanced by teamwork.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC), intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition procedures to METCON, 805 Shadden Rd., Gray, TN 37615-4243, as the only responsible source that can provide services for daily regional flood potential analysis, to include forecasts of flood potential out to 4 days in the future. This data will be provided daily through the end of June 2018. The UROC requires statistical analysis of historical runoff data to provide return period frequency estimates in support of various military planning and operational requirements worldwide. This data will provide decision makers with guidance and insight into the likelihood of certain flood conditions occurring in a given year and enable more informed courses of action to be pursued. To fulfill this Task, METCON will utilize daily historical runoff model data derived from &frac14; degree Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data to produce runoff estimates for return periods of 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, 20-year, 50-year and 100-year, and these results will be calibrated with &frac14; degree NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) data using one year of comparative analysis between GLDAS and GFS runoff data. The runoff return analysis will be provided globally using GeoTIFF raster data.<br />&nbsp;
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures. There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541690 with a Small Business Size Standard of $15,000,000.00. This notice of intent is for information purposes only. All sources eligible to provide these services must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly articulate the ability to provide these services as outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received within 5 calendar days after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining this product through a sole source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to traci.k.hoofman@usace.army.mil. The solicitation number shall be included in the subject line of e-mail submissions. Responses must be received no later than 12:00 p.m. CST on 9 March 2018.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE<br /><br />Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, intends to negotiate a sole source Firm-Fixed Price contract for The Doctor's Software in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 15.2, as supplemented with additional information in this notice. The contract will be awarded to&nbsp;The Doctor's Software.&nbsp;Market research was previously conducted and it has been determined that this is a sole source requirement IAW FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Interested sources must respond in writing with clear and convincing evidence to support their ability to provide the required supplies/services within three (3) days of this publication. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Justification: Supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted with only one respondent able to meet the government's needs due to the information being proprietary: The Doctor's Software. Lt Col Peter A. Sandness, AFLCMC/AQ, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, 45433, has been appointed as Ombudsman to hear concerns from offerors, or potential offerors, during the proposal development. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. Existence of the Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer. Accordingly, the Ombudsman does not participate in the preparation of solicitations, the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process and, therefore, for routine matters on individual solicitations, please contact the buyer at the telephone number listed herein. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this acquisition should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Brandon Engelman at (937) 656-7530 or e-mail: <a>brandon.engelman@us.af.mil</a>.

E.2	NOTICE OF FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR AGENCY PROTESTS
A.	Preface
Prior to submission of an agency protest, all parties must use their best efforts to resolve concerns raised by an interested party. FEMA offers, as an option for dispute resolution, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR).  ADR in an informal, expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve contract issues and is designed to promote satisfying solutions and fair procedures. For more information on FEMA's ADR services, please contact FEMA's ADR office at the following address: 500 C Street SW, Washington, DC 20472.  If concerns cannot be resolved, protesters may use these procedures when a resolution is requested from the agency.  These procedures have been designed to create an avenue for resolving third party grievances in connection with the acquisition process outside of formal processes through the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the United States Court of Federal Claims (CFC). Filing an agency protest is not a prerequisite to filing at the GAO or CFC. If the protester files a protest through the GAO or CFC while their protest is pending at the agency level, FEMA may dismiss the agency protest.  Pursuing an agency protest does not extend the time for obtaining a stay at GAO. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest procedures contained in FAR Subpart 33.103.<BR><BR>B.	Definitions.
(1)	"Agency protest," as used in this SOP, is one that may be filed with either the Contracting Officer or the officer responsible for the resolution of all agency protests filed at the level above the Contracting Officer.
(2)	"Ombudsman," as used in this SOP, is the agency official above the level of the Contracting Officer designated by the Director of the Acquisition Management Division to handle and issue the formal agency decision resolving the protest.	Protesters using these procedures may protest directly to the Ombudsman.
(3)	"Day," as used in this SOP, is a calendar day. In computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or a Federal holiday.  Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of FEMA are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the Agency is open.

C.	Submission Guidelines.
(1)	Agency protests may be filed through the Contracting Officer or, at the level above the Contracting Officer, through the Ombudsman either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested) as follows:
a.	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman must be mailed to FEMA DR-4332-TX
Attn: Mr. Sherwin C. Turner
Contracting Officer 
11000 N. Interstate 35
Austin, TX 78753

-OR-

OCPO
Attn: David Orris Building D, Room 123
16825 South Seton Avenue Emmitsburg, MD 21727
b.	The outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be marked "Agency Protest".
c.	If the protester submits the protest directly through the Ombudsman, the protester must also, within one (1) day of submitting the protest to the Ombudsman, submit a copy of the protest to the responsible Contracting Officer either by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
(2)	) To be filed on a given day, protests and any subsequent appeals must be received by 4:30 PM, current-local time. Any protests received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next day.
(3)	Protest submissions will not be considered filed until all of the following information is provided:
a.	the protester's name, address, telephone number and fax number;
b.	the solicitation or contract number;
c.	a detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for protests, to include an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced;
d.	copies of relevant documents;
e.	a request for ruling by the agency;
f.	a statement detailing the form of relief requested;
g.	all information establishing that the protester is an interested party for the purposes of filing a protest; and
h.	all information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
(4)	All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester, and must be addressed to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman.<BR><BR>D.	Timeliness/Resolution of Protests.
(1)	Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation.
(2)	Protests other than those covered by paragraph (1) of this section shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known (whichever is earlier), with the exception of protests challenging a procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is required. In such cases, with respect to any protest basis which is known or should have been known either before or as a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which the debriefing is held.
(3)	Protests filed through the Contracting Officer.
a.	Within twenty (20) days after the protest is filed through the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Return Receipt Requested)".
b.	Appeals
i.	Protesters who filed protests through the Contracting Officer may, within five (5) days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's written ruling, appeal to the Ombudsman.
ii.	Requests for Appellate Review must be submitted to the Ombudsman by FAX transmission or by "Certified Mail" (Return Receipt Requested).
iii.	The Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within ten (10) days of receipt of the request for appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision.
iv.	In accordance with FAR 33.103(d) (4) and 4 C.F.R 21.2(a) (3), if there is an agency appellate review of the Contracting Officer's decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO'S timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within ten (10) days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.
(4)	Protests filed through the Ombudsman:
a.	If the protester protests directly through the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman will send a written ruling and a summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester by "Certified Mail (Mail Receipt Requested)" within thirty-five (35) days after the protest was filed.
b.	Protests filed directly through the Ombudsman cannot be appealed within the agency.<BR><BR>E.	Dismissal of Protests.
The agency may dismiss protests when protesters file protests through the GAO or CFC while their protests are pending at the agency level; and for failure to comply with any of the requirements of these agency protest procedures. For example, the agency may dismiss protests that are procedurally or substantively defective (e.g., the protest is untimely or the protest fails).<BR><BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items.  All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty.<BR><BR>AbilityOne products will be given consideration.<BR><BR>

If we do not receive enough competition and/or reasonably priced offers from the ISBEE set-aside, we will then evaluate quotes and consider for award to other small business concerns. Any acquisition resulting from this cascading set-aside will be from such a concern as follows: First Tier: Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise, Second Tier: Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Business and Third Tier: HubZone and Fourth Tier: all other Small Business Concerns. Offers received from enterprises that are not one of these small business concerns will not be considered.</p>
<p>Notice of Indian Small Business Economic Enterprise Set-Aside Clause (see HHSAR Subpart 326.6), (a) Definitions as used in this clause. Indian means a person who is a member of an Indian Tribe or "Native" as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203; 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Indian Economic Enterprise (Firm) means a sole enterprise, partnership, corporation, or other type of business organization owned, controlled, and operated by: (1) One or more Indians (including, for the purpose of sections 301 and 302 of Public Law 94?437, former or currently federally recognized Indian tribes in the State of New York); or (2) By an Indian firm (as defined in paragraph (1) of this definition); or (3) A nonprofit firm organized for the benefit of Indians and controlled by Indians (see 326.601(a)). Indian small business economic enterprise (ISBEE) means an IEE that is also a small business concern established in accordance with the criteria and size standards of 13 CFR part 121.</p>
<p>To ensure actual control over the enterprise, the individuals must possess requisite management or technical capabilities directly related to the primary industry in which the enterprise conducts business. The enterprise must meet these requirements throughout the following time periods: (1) At the time an offer is made in response to a written solicitation; (2) At the time of contract award; and, (3) During the full term of the contract. Indian Tribe means an Indian Tribe, band, nation, or other recognized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, including any Alaska Native village, regional or village corporation established under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (PL 92-203, 85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601). Representation means the positive statement by an enterprise of its eligibility for preferential consideration and participation for acquisitions conducted under the Buy Indian Act, 25 U.S.C. 47, in accordance with the procedures in HHSAR Subpart 326.6. (b) General. (1) Under the Buy Indian Act, offers for this acquisition will be solicited only from Indian small business economic enterprises. (2) IHS will reject all offers received from ineligible enterprises (see cascading set-aside). (3) Any award resulting from this solicitation will be made to an Indian small business economic enterprise, as defined in paragraph (a) of this clause (unless there is not enough competition and/or reasonably priced offers see cascading set-aside).</p>

<div><br />Page 1 of 3</div>
<div>This document serves as a list of frequently asked questions that have been received since the RFI was released.

<div><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GENERAL</span></div>
<div><br /><strong>Question</strong>: Are Respondents only required to complete the attached Excel for the RFI or can Respondents also include a word document in additional to that addresses each of the seven (7) areas under Scope?</div>
<div><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, please provide responses on the spreadsheet. Back-up information may be provided in a Word or PDF document.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Question</strong>: Is it a requirement for the Respondents to provide computing equipment, tools, office facilities, and infrastructure along with the labor?</div>
<div><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes. The Subcontractor must fully equip its employees for them to complete the work.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Ques</strong><strong>tion:</strong> Does the Respondent need to have an office in California?</div>
<div><strong>Answer:</strong>The Respondent does not have to have office space currently in the local area but will need to propose a location in the management volume of the RFP consistent with the location and connectivity requirements stated in the Request for Proposal (RFP). This will become part of the evaluation criteria and scored. Respondents will need to show the capability to fulfill all contract requirements and a serious intent to successfully perform.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Question</strong>: Will this Subcontract award be a Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) opportunity?</div>

<div>Page 2 of 3</div>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />SUPPLIER INFORMATION WORKSHEET<br /><br /></span></strong></div>
<div><strong>Question #1</strong>: Please clarify the meaning of the term "DIRECT," which is used in multiple places in this RFI. Does &ldquo;DIRECT&rdquo; mean any person who receives their compensation and benefits (i.e. vacation pay, insurance, pension plan, etc.) from an employer and the employer withholds income taxes, social security, Medicare taxes, and pays unemployment tax on wages paid to the employee? Is this the correct interpretation?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #1</strong>: Yes, that is a correct interpretation.<br /></div>
<div><strong>Question #3</strong>: Please clarify the meaning of "technically led" in the context of this question. Our interpretation of this phrase is that the Respondent is a Prime contractor leading a contract that requires technical skills similar to those specified in Exhibit 1. Is this the correct interpretation?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #3</strong>: Yes, that is a correct interpretation.<br /></div>
<div><strong>Question #6</strong>: In the context of this question, does PARTNER refer to a business relationship, which could be either a Prime or Subcontract role? And if a Respondent does not have Prime contracts with partners, how should they answer?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #6</strong>: Yes, Partner could be either Prime or Subcontract-role in this context. Respondents who do not have Prime contracts with partners should provide three (3) references of Primes to which they were a subcontractor.</div>
<div><strong>Question #6</strong>: What does the term &ldquo;Partner References&rdquo; mean? Is JPL looking for information on former teammate / subcontractor companies that Respondents have worked with on previous contracts? Or are these to be references from companies that Respondents are planning to partner with on this opportunity if we are the successful offeror?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #6</strong>: JPL is looking for references on former teammate / subcontractor companies that Respondents have worked with on previous contracts.</div>

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES WORKSHEET<br /><br /></strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Question #3</strong>: What is JPL's definition of a &ldquo;manager&rdquo;? For example, does this mean employees who have direct reports, the term manager in their job title, or those who have managed people who fall into the roles listed in Exhibit 1?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #3</strong>: In this context, a manager is a person responsible for controlling or administering an organization or group of staff, and is regarded in terms of their skill. JPL is looking for the number of direct managers who currently manage employees who perform tasks in the discipline areas / roles listed in Exhibit I.</div>
<div><strong>Question #3</strong>: Respondents are required to fill in the data that aligns with the roles in Exhibit 1. Is it acceptable for Respondents to add rows or columns to the spreadsheet to provide additional detail?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #3:</strong> Respondents can add additional lines as necessary. Supporting or back-up information should be provided in a Word or PDF document.<br /></div>
<div><strong>Question #4</strong>: Should respondents reply to this question from the perspective of a prime role or a subcontractor role?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #4:</strong> Respondents should answer the question for both Prime and Subcontract roles.</div>
<div><strong>Question #4</strong>: What is the definition of "task type" contracts as used in the RFI? Does this mean Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity, Task Order contracts? For Labor-Hour contracts, are we to follow the FAR 16.602 definition? Should Time-and-Material type contracts also to be included?</div>
<div><strong>Answer #4:</strong> The definition of a &ldquo;task type&rdquo; Subcontract as used in this RFI is when a Subcontractor is responsible for delivery of work. The definition of a &ldquo;labor type&rdquo; Subcontract as used in this RFI is when a Subcontractor is responsible for delivery of labor hours. Do not follow the FAR 16.602 definition. Responses should be limited to only Task type and Labor type.</div>

<DESC><p>This is a Synopsis announcement in accordance with FAR 5.202 in anticipation of a future contract award.</p>
<p>Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) has a Single Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) requirement for ship repair and modernization for the upcoming USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) FY20 Planned Incremental Availability (PIA), USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN69) FY20 Dry-Docking Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA), USS George W. Bush (CVN 77) FY23 PIA and other CVNs homeported or visiting locations in Hampton Roads, Virginia, based on the CVN Program Record dated 13 Sep 17. The period of performance for the CVN Nuclear Support IDIQ contract is five years from the contract award date, currently scheduled for December 2018. The CVN Nuclear Support IDIQ contract will be utilized to facilitate the advance planning, planning/material, prefabrication, manpower, support services, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during execution of each of the aforementioned availabilities. The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear support and propulsion systems, work within nuclear-controlled spaces, and work on specialized systems (e.g. catapults, aircraft elevators, etc.) that only the original ship builder can perform.</p>
<p>As the design and construction shipyard, Huntington Ingalls Incorporated - Newport News Shipbuilding (HII-NNS) has unique experience needed to successfully repair, provide maintenance, and modernization on the aforementioned nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. The Navy has determined that the use of other than full and open competition is appropriate for the procurement of this requirement. Due to the nature of work, the Government does not anticipate significant subcontracting opportunities. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact HII-NNS directly.</p>
<p>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https: www.fbo.gov. FBO is the single point of entry for the posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet.</p>

<DESC><p>The Senior Rule of Law/Justice Sector and Human Rights Advisor will provide professional/technical leadership and management of ongoing USAID DRG activities; the development of a new strategic vision leading to the development, design, implementation, management; and monitoring and evaluation of new and future programs that promote strengthening rule of law, justice sector reform along with advocating on behalf of the rights of Haitian citizens, especially as they relate to youth, gender and LGBTI issues. The Senior Rule of Law/Justice Sector and Human Rights Advisor will support the DRG Office to promote the rule of law, strengthen the judicial system, and improve human rights conditions and advocacy on behalf of youth, LGBTI and the abused in Haiti. The environment faced in strengthening the justice sector and rule of law as well as in addressing human rights is unusually complex. The inertia of the political system in Haiti and the conservative attitudes of r&eacute;sistance to change as illustrated in the Latin American Public Opinion Survey Reports of Vanderbilt University further impede these activities. The weak state of the justice sector and capacity of civil society to advocate on behalf of their rights are among the most intractable issues that limit Haiti's efforts to promote social and economic justice. The variety of actors in the GoH, the legal community, the international/donor community and vested interests (elites) all compete with one another to shape the judiciary and human rights environment.</p>
<p>To achieve improvements in the rule of law and justice, the Advisor will need a broad range of management, negotiation and, especially, leadership skills and sound judgement in all of the foregoing programmatic areas, with an emphasis on day-to-day contract and grant management, supervision of technical staff and engagement with senior Government of Haiti (GoH), donor and USAID officials to achieve progress in the justice sector, rule of law and citizens' rights.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District will be issuing an Invitation for Bids for Maintenance and Repairs of the North Jetty feature of the Federal Navigation Project (FNP) in Scituate Harbor, Scituate, MA. This project is set-aside for small business. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990. The estimated construction cost is expected to range from $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.
<p>The work of this project consists of repairing several sections of the North Jetty at Scituate Harbor. The nose of the north jetty (i.e. seaward end) along with other smaller areas along the structure were damaged during Winter Storm Juno in 2015 and subsequent storms. Approximately 2,000 tons of new armor stone will be required to make repairs to the nose section of the jetty. The new armor stones will vary in size from 6-8 tons. The work includes dismantling, removing, stockpiling, reworking and reinstalling existing armor stone as well as acquiring and installing new armor in the jetty repair areas. The repaired areas must be properly interlocked and be within specified design tolerances. The new armor stones will be required to be delivered via waterborne plant and placed upon the shore behind the State spur jetty for further placement into the structure. No over the road transport of stones will be allowed. Due to significant eelgrass beds adjacent to the structure in the interior of the harbor, stone placement work will be required to be performed from the top of the structure.</p>

All reports of reading and inspections required by the specifications shall be submitted to the COR in writing using a "Condition Found Report (CFR)" form, within 24 hours after the readings and/or inspections are made. <br />Promptness in taking and reporting readings is particularly important for underbody work items such as shaft bearing or rudder bearing clearances. Often during the progress of a work item, conditions are discovered by the contractor which are considered abnormal for reasons of safety, expected reliability, health, or habitability. These conditions must be brought to the attention of the Coast Guard using a CFR. Details provided by the Contractor in a CFR are important because the CFR may result in a contract change. To speed the contract change progress, the Contractor should include in his/her CFR the following details as a minimum:</p>
<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>
<p>(iii) A clear statement, definition, and description of the condition found, including but not limited to frame numbers, part numbers, materials and dimensions as appropriate.</p>
<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final price of this contract.<br />Alternate II (Jul 1985). If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, substitute paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) below for paragraphs (g), (h), and (l) of the basic clause:<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman, Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</span></p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In our assessment these Military antennas are rated to 150MPH. Would the Government please consider making the surviving wind speed 150 MPH vs 180 MPH.</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Must be rated to survive sustained winds of 185 mph</p>

Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yes, correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If not, how long does the cabling need to be?</p>
<p>The government shall handle all Interfacility Link (IFL) cabling.&nbsp; The government shall require, from the vendor, detailed information about the wiring standard and cabling required for the installation of the antenna and its control system.</p>

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>1. Local and/or command Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)<br />2. Local and/or command engineering practices<br />3. US Navy OPNAV INSTR 1500.75 High Risk Instruction<br />4. USCG Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook<br />3.2.1 Instructor Education and Qualifications: At a minimum the contracted personnel conducting the training shall have the qualifications listed below. These qualifications shall be provided to, and vetted and verified by, the bidding contractor via course graduations certificates, letters of appointment, or other substantiating documentations or official correspondence.</p>
<p>1. Boat Captain qualified for the 11-Meter Willard RHIB and/or Naval Special Warfare (NSW) 11M RHIB qualified. <br />2. Boat Coxswain qualified for the 11-Meter Willard RHIB by the US Navy or Coast Guard.<br />a) Rationale: To teach a "Train-2-Qualify" Course, the instructor must have been qualified on the platform he/she is instructing.<br />3. Served in a training department of an active duty or reserve US Navy or US Coast Guard command.<br />a) Rationale: Instructors will maintain good order and disciple in the class room using a military system. The instructor must understand this and have been a leader. Instructors also interact with military ranks from E-1 to O-6.<br />4. Possession of a valid US Coast Guard Masters License - A 100 Ton Masters License with a near coastal endorsement is desirable.<br />5. The Senior/Lead Instructor must possess of a valid USCG Near Coastal Masters License of 25 Gross Tons or greater.<br />a) Rationale: This license ensures the customer receives instruction on Rules Of The Road. These are the US Coast Guard recognized boat handling regulations and requirements on the water. This is the etiquette of handling the 11-Meter Willard RHIB around other ships and during all operations while away from the pier. All Navy ships and boats follow these regulations.<br />6. Navy NEC 9502 instructor qualification (or other service equivalent) <br />a) Rationale: Students will all be military members; ensures instructors are trained in the delivery of instructional material. <br />7. Normal color vision (must not be color blind).<br />a) Rationale: The buoyage system for maritime navigation is color coded.<br />8. Physically capable of standing for prolonged periods on small boats, while wearing 20 lbs. of flotation, communications, and other gear.<br />a) Rationale: The instructors will be standing on the boat for 4-8 hours in a normal day during practical application.<br />9. Physically capable of climbing Jacob ladders while wearing flotation gear.<br />a) Rational: The instructors are often required to climb onto/off the ship for operational liaison needs. This happens during the day/night from the 11-Meter Willard RHIB while the ship is at sea. <br />10. Capable of working on an open deck 11-Meter Willard RHIB in all weather.<br />a) Rationale: The operational environment is not always sunny. It rains, there is fog and cold. Instructors must provide their own foul weather gear and safety equipment.<br />11. Meet US Navy 1st Class swimmer requirements per CNET Inst. P 1552/16<br />a) Rationale: Practical application tasks place in harbors and open ocean environments in an open cockpit 11-Meter Willard RHIB. Students (or an instructor) may fall into the water.<br />12. Pass a security background check (National Crime Information Center). <br />a) Rationale: Working with military members and government equipment the instructor position requires someone without a criminal record.<br />13. Eligible for, or hold a, valid SECRET clearance.<br />a) Rationale: While the course in unclassified, access to the ship requires a clearance.<br />14. Successfully complete Drug Screen (5-panel DOT). <br />a) Rationale: The position of instructor is critically important to student safety. The policy of zero tolerance on drug is a requirement. The instructor will make on-the-spot decisions which will affect the entire 11-Meter Willard RHIB safety.<br />15. Possess current CPR/1st Aid Certifications (American Red Cross/American Heart Association).<br />a) Rationale: The training is at times High Risk and instructors may have the need to administer CPR/1st Aid. Also, portions of training will be offshore and no medical care is immediately available.<br />16. Received training for, and participated in, Launch Handling and Recovery System operations for the: Freedom variant 1 (Lockheed Martin variant) Water Maneuvering Zone (WMZ) Stern Ramp, and the Independence variant 2 (Austal Ship variant) Twin Boom Extension Crane (TBEC).<br />a) Rationale: This is a High-Risk course. To train TBEC &amp; WMZ operations, the instructors must have knowledge of the system, and must have also completed launching and recovering operations. <br />17. Must have a valid state driver's license. <br />a) Rationale: The contracted instructors may be required to drive various types of government vehicles while conducting the three week course.<br />18. Background in the creation and delivery of Concept of Operations (CONOPs) briefing to staff level officers and Government Specialist (GS) personnel.<br />a) Rationale: The 11-Meter Willard RHIB course has a requirement to create and plan operations with LCS Ships during the course. This includes the creation of briefs and explanations of RHIB operations which are delivered to the senior ship staff (CO, XO, Operations Officer). The senior staff has limited time. The instructors must ensure the brief, given by student, is correct and ready for presentation from both an operational point and Operational Risk Management (ORM) point.<br />19. 11-Meter Willard RHIB troubleshooting knowledge, skills, and abilities.<br />a) Rationale: The 11-Meter Willard RHIBs will, from time-to-time, break down or have issues. The course instructors will need to be able to quickly and safety handle these issues.<br />4.0 Training Dates</p>

Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.

The government may either make a responsibility determination without requesting any information from a quoter or require a quoter to provide information to substantiate that it satisfies the general responsibility standards of FAR 9.104-1.
 An offerors quote will be evaluated as technically acceptable by providing a complete quote utilizing Attachment 3. Additionally, the offeror must take no exceptions to the PWS or any solicitation term to be evaluated as technically acceptable. 

The Contracting Officer will rank quotes from lowest to highest price, and review the quotes of the three lowest priced quoters, if those quotes are rated technically acceptable, then award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable quote without further evaluating the technical acceptability of the other quoters. 

System for Award Management (SAM). Quoters must be registered in the SAM database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.sam.gov/.
 
 
All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name, e-mail and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements in the PWS.

This is a notice to all offerors that FedBizOpps Combined Synopsis Solicitation 36C25618Q0343 is being amended to add/change the following:
Add/provide responses to all vendors who asked questions about the solicitation. Responses to vendor questions (master list) are annotated below.

SOW Reference
Question
Answer
1.
A.1 Price/Cost
What is the difference between the Monthly Preventive Maint. (PM) service for Instrument trays (0001) and Montly Instrumentation for Instrument trays (0002)*

*The description looks to be the same.  Am I correct in that the facility wants instruments and trays (a total of 20 trays/month) and including the Clinic, Laboratory and repair bin, serviced two days per month.  Is 0001 for day one (1) and 0002 for day two (2)?  


There is not a difference between the monthly Preventive Maintenance and Monthly Instrumentation for instrument trays. As Preventive Maintenance (PM) and Instrumentation are one in the same line items will be updated in the solicitation. 

Please refer to the subsequent amendment to this solicitation. Contractors shall use A.1 REVISED PRICE/COST SCHEDULE & ITEM INFORMATION to prepare their offer and their pricing for line items. 
2.
All Sections
Does the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation under solicitation number 36C25618Q0343 contain requirements similar to a current contract?
If possible, please provide the current contract number.
Or, is this a new requirement for the government?

Solicitation 36C25618Q0343 corresponds to a new requirement for the facility. To the best of the government s knowledge this requirement is not related to a previously awarded contract nor is related to an action that was previously done. To the best of the government s knowledge, instrument repair (and related services) have been "piecemeal" up to this point in the facility. A contract is therefore needed for these services.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Information (RFI) </strong></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br />for</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Contract Undergraduate Pilot Training Support for United States Air Force (CUPT)</strong></p>
<p>This is an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong><br />1. This RFI includes a description of the CUPT requirement, a Contractor Capability Survey which allows you to provide your company's capability, and Course Training Standards (CTS) (upon request through www.FBO.gov). <br />2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, you should provide documentation that supports your company's capability in meeting these requirements. Failure to provide documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)<br />3. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 30 pages, and identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their responses are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.<br />4. Both large and small businesses are encouraged to participate in this Market Research. Joint ventures or teaming arrangements are encouraged.<br />5. The Government anticipates a Firm-Fixed-Price contract could come from these efforts. For purposes of this RFI, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 611512, Flight Training and the small business size standard is $27.5 Million in annual gross receipts.<br />6. AETC plans to host an Industry Day event following the RFI results (around March 2018 at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph) in order to have further exchanges with industry. Details will follow with a subsequent posting on www.FBO.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose:</strong><br />1. We are conducting market research to: <br />a. Determine the extent to which commercial sources are capable of conducting the operations associated with CUPT (flying operations, academics, aircraft maintenance, security, etc.)?<br />b. Determine potential locations capable of supporting CUPT requirements.<br />c. Determine efficiencies/cost savings which can be gained through different approaches to all aspects of the CUPT requirements?<br />d. Determine a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) estimate pertaining to the cost and level of effort of this service.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong><br />Currently, the Air Force is experiencing a shortage of pilots across the total force. In order to grow the inventory required to close this gap over the next five to ten years requires an increase in pilot production in excess of the capacity of the existing UPT bases. One solution to temporarily increase capacity is to establish a contract training capability to augment the capacity of the existing structure. This contract training program will provide UPT training capacity to help increase the net production of pilots and reduce the pilot shortage.</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong><br />Beginning in 2019 CUPT will use a modified AETC UPT syllabus to produce 80-100 graduates per year in an UPT program, with the capability to produce up to 120 graduates per year. In this construct the contractor would provide training for Phase 1 (pre-flight ground training), Phase 2 (T-6 flight training), Phase 3 (T-38C flight training) and all associated academic and simulator training to comply with the modified AETC syllabus.</p>
<p>USAF will provide T-6A and T-38C training aircraft as well as a modified syllabus for each Phase of training.</p>
<p>USAF will provide on-site aircraft supply chain management and aircraft-specific support equipment (equipment that is normally only Government supplied).<br />USAF students will procure their own lodging and food.</p>
<p>CUPT will be located at the contractor provided location OR at a government provided location; ROMs should be developed for both options. Contractor provided location, at a minimum, should include two parallel runways: one 8,000ft and one 6,000ft as well as an auxiliary airfield, operating airspace within 100 miles, and ramp/hangar space to support T-6A and T-38C aircraft.</p>
<p>USAF will provide oversight via Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs) for the overall program to include maintenance and operational oversight and student management, up to 34 personnel.</p>
<p><strong>Contractor Requirements: </strong><br />Contractor will provide:</p>
<p>Instructor Pilots (IPs) and Maintenance personnel and conduct training in accordance with the AETC provided syllabus and Program Flying Training (PFT) guidance.</p>
<p>Simulation devices (part task trainers, simulators, virtual reality, etc.) or equivalent capabilities to satisfy simulator syllabus events. The USAF will approve the intended devices to ensure that it satisfies the simulator requirements of the syllabus.</p>
<p>Adequate aircraft shelters in the event of inclement weather.</p>
<p>Security or arrange to have security provided for all on campus personnel, training facilities and aircraft IAW Department of Homeland of Security Risk Management Process: An Interagency Security Committee Standard, 2nd Edition 2016.</p>
<p>Maintenance of all aircraft, facilities, and other property.<br />&bull; Maintenance will be responsible for all aspects of the organizational and intermediate-level maintenance operation, including, but not limited to:<br />o Managing the full cycle of production by planning, scheduling, directing, and controlling all maintenance on assigned T-38C and T-6A aircraft in accordance with all AFIs and AETCIs, to include related support and training equipment<br />o Performing on-and off-equipment maintenance (repairs, scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, inspections, Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTOs), Time Change Items (TCls) and One Time Inspections (OTls)) on all assigned aircraft and support equipment.

<p>Request for Information. This a Request for Information Only (RFI).</p>
<p>Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) in support of the Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S), Project Manager Distributed Common Ground System-Army (PM DCGS-A), is conducting market research to identify commercial items to satisfy current DCGS-A requirements pertaining to United States (U.S.) Army's DCGS-A Fixed Site facilities. The Government invites all business and academic organizations to respond to this RFI notice.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. Government may revise its draft requirements at any time, or may elect not to proceed with a procurement. Solicitations are not available at this time. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. This RFI is not an authorization to begin work, and the Government will not pay any costs that contractors may incur in response to this RFI.<br /><br />Contractors are not required to respond to this announcement, but may do so at their own cost. The United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.<br /><br />Additionally, the Government intends to conduct a market research product demonstration in accordance with this RFI. The Government will not pay any costs resulting from attendance or participation at the market research product demonstration.</p>
<p>Only contractors that respond to this RFI are eligible to participate in the market research product demonstration, which is for market research purposes only. The Government won't award any contracts as a result of the market research product demonstration.<br /><br />Failure to respond to this RFI, or failure to participate in a market research product demonstration, will not preclude contractor participation in any RFP or procurement, if any is issued.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>AN/FSQ-209(V)1, commonly referred to as the Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A) Intelligence Processing Center Version 1 (IPC-v1), is the battlefield intelligence system that hosts DCGS-A software at US Army Fixed Site facilities. It provides fully integrated and timely intelligence on the battlefield. The DCGS-A IPC-v1 is the core framework for a worldwide distributed, network centric, system-of-systems architecture that conducts collaborative intelligence operations and production. The system is housed in the DCGS-A Fixed Site facilities and consists of privately hosted servers and storage arrays.</p>
<p>This RFI is focused on identifying commercial items to upgrade/replace the DCGS-A IPC-v1 enterprise data warehouse component, also known as the "Brain", as well as introduce several additional analytics and system management functions. Specifically, Capability Drop (CD) 2 focuses on the modernization and enhancement of the DCGS-A data warehousing capabilities resident at Military Intelligence (MI) Operations Battalions supporting Army Service Component Commands (ASCCs) by providing a scalable solution that provides an adaptable Data Management Architecture (DMA), automated analytics, and common core services.</p>
<p>Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager - Foundation (TCM-F) has developed, in conjunction with the Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), a draft Capability Drop requirements document outlining the operationally relevant requirements for DCGS-A's enterprise data warehouse and analytics capability.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI may be used by the Government to determine invitees for a market research product demonstration based on criteria such as: number and quality of the responses, magnitude of CD-2 requirements a solution can currently meet, additional capabilities of interest to the Government, overall technical risk, and availability of resources. Only companies that respond to this RFI with existing commercial items, to include existing integrated products that currently meets, or has the potential to meet, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 Definition of a "commercial item," may be invited to a market research product demonstration.<br /><br />3.0 White Paper and Supporting Documentation</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Solider/Squad Virtual Trainer:</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>March 2, 2018: An updated S/SVT Statement of Need has been attached to this announcement.<br /></strong><br /><em>The S/SVT Request for White Paper is anticipated for release mid-March 2018.<br /></em><br />-------<br /><br />Previous Posting:<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The S/SVT Industry Day, has been rescheduled to occur on February 26 - 27, 2018. If you have previously registered for the SiVT or S/SVT Industry Day, please register again (see information below within "HOW TO REGISTER" for the UPDATED registration process).</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Combined Arms Center for Training (CAC-T), Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, will conduct an Industry Day on <strong>February 26 - 27, 2018</strong> at the Frontier Conference Center on Ft Leavenworth, Kansas. The objective of this event is to communicate the S/SVT concept to Industry partners and Academia, also to address any questions or concerns interested parties may have regarding the effort.</p>
<p>Solider/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT) reflects a combination of the Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT) and the Solider Virtual Trainer (SVT) efforts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Industry Day attendees are strongly encouraged to review any attached documents and prepare any questions prior to the Industry Day event on <strong>February 26 - 27, 2018.</strong></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Army lacks an integrated Soldier and Squad simulation training capability for close combat, multi-domain battle in diverse complex operational environments. Moreover, there are virtual training shortfalls for qualification and certification of precision targeting with precision munitions, replication and integration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter UAS operations, as well as the conduct and clearance of fires and airspace de-confliction. The Army seeks to develop the next generation virtual training capability through the S/SVT effort to fill those gaps and advance weapons skill development, call for fire, and use of force training.</p>
<p>To address the gaps identified above, the Army/USMC requires a scalable, transportable, Soldier/squad close combat simulation trainer that provides:</p>
<p>- Realistic and tailorable OE and Acceptable equipment form, fit, and function that allows squad dismounted operations</p>
<p>- Provides training at the Point of Need</p>
<p>- Scalable from the individual to squad</p>
<p>- Software engine agnostic</p>
<p>- Intelligent tutor that captures and builds upon each repetition to accelerate skill acquisition</p>
<p>- Provides user feedback/AAR capability</p>
<p>- Soldier enabled capability that reduces overall setup time for increased training throughput</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>INDUSTRY DAY DETAILS:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">Industry Day participation is available on a first come, first serve basis.

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</strong></div>
<strong>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>HID &amp; Standard ISO Prox Card</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>RFQ-2018-053 &amp; RFQ-2018-054</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong>March 2, 2018</strong></div>
</strong> <strong>Question 1:</strong> For RFQ-2018-053, do the cards have to be manufactured by HID? We do have the HID card, but we manufacture our own cards as well with the exact same encoding information and the cost of our cards are significantly less and provide the same quality and functionality as the HID cards.<br /><strong>Answer 1:</strong> Yes, the HID cards will have to be of the "HID" brand name, but I would like to advise you that we have a separate RFQ (RFQ-2018-054) in which we are procuring any comparable equivalent ISO prox card to the HID card (that meets all of the named specifications). Please find the posting here: https://www.fbo.gov/spg/Senate/SAA/SAAFD/RFQ-2018-054/listing.html/.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 2:</strong> We want to confirm solicitation #RFQ-2018-053 and #RFQ-2018-054 are 2 separate solicitations? What is the difference between the two requests? Will they be awarded to the same bidder?<br /><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Yes, the solicitations are separate (mutually exclusive, in fact) but related in that the prox cards being sourced from both RFQs are identical except for the HID brand name. The HID cards, however, are the preferred procured product, but will be subject to a determination by the US Capitol Police if they will be usable based on the card number range available at the time of award. If the HID cards are determined to be usable, then the Senate will purchase the cards from the best value bidder from RFQ-2018-053 and RFQ-2018-054 will not be awarded. However, if US Capitol Police determines that the HID brand cards are not a functional option, then the Senate will purchase the cards from the best value bidder from RFQ-2018-054 and RFQ-2018-053 will not be awarded. There will only be one award made for an order of 30,000* prox cards. We do encourage any vendor who is able to bid on both RFQs to do so. Again, submissions for RFQ-2018-053 will be of the HID brand, and submissions for RFQ-2018-054 will be of any comparable equivalent, no matter the brand name.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 3:</strong> Will the Capitol Police be able to make the determination before the due dates for the RFQs?<br /><strong>Answer 3:</strong> Unfortunately the Capitol Police will not be able to make this determination prior to the deadline of the RFQs and may even likely delay the award being made. These events, however, were anticipated upon the creation of these RFQs and is the reason they were released simultaneously. Due to the urgency of the demand, having both RFQs in place will hopefully allow the Senate to have a ready alternative should the HID cards not be deemed usable.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 4</strong>:	Can you provide samples of the artwork? I specifically need to know the number of colors and any bleed. Could you provide the customer artwork number? <br /><strong>Answer 4:</strong> The Senate acknowledges that some misleading information may appear in the product description. The "artwork" that is referenced in the RFQ is the term used for the custom printing (text) that will be dictated for the back of the card at the time of award. There is no "artwork" as it might otherwise be identified. The cards shall be white and there will be no color other than the black of the font printed on the back.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 5:</strong> Can you provide a photo or PDF of what the card looks like along with what you consider to be composite material?<br /><strong>Answer 5:</strong> Unfortunately we don't have any pictures available because our stock is imprinted with sensitive information. PVC is an example of an acceptable composite material.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 6:</strong> For the HID cards, with this be a reorder with artwork that has been used previously? <br /><strong>Answer 6:</strong> Yes, the "artwork" (or printing more specifically) will be replicating that used previously.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 7:</strong> Are you looking to order with the HID Corporate 1000?<br /><strong>Answer 7:</strong> No, we will not be ordering HID Corporate 1000.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 8: </strong> What does the printed piece look like, what is the size of it? Is this is an RFID card?<br /><strong>Answer 8:</strong> The cards shall be plain white with black text on the back side of the card. They are the standard CR80 size. Yes, the cards should have an RFID chip, but they will not require a smartcard chip.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 9:</strong> What exactly will we be doing with the cards? Are we installing them into systems? Will we be programming them?<br /><strong>Answer 9:</strong> The awarded vendor will simply be providing the customized (pre-printed) cards at the determination of the US Capitol Police who will dictate the requisite card number range. The required printed text information will be provided at the time of award.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Question 10:</strong> We would like to send you some preliminary samples of ISO cards for you to examine.  Would it be possible to ship you sample ISO cards and if so what is the delivery destination for the samples?  What are the Preprinted Graphics you want on the card and any other designs details for the card?  Once you receive the samples may we have feedback from you regarding the technical acceptability before we bid?<br /><strong>Answer 10:</strong> Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we will not be able to accept sample submissions.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong><br />*PLEASE NOTE THAT THE QUANTITY HAS BEEN CHANGED TO 30,000 PROX CARDS. DELIVERY, HOWEVER, WILL BE ARRANGED IN TWO (2) SEPARATE AND STAGGERED SHIPMENTS. </strong></p>
<p><strong>**PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT DUE TO THIS CHANGE IN REQUIREMENT, WE ARE EXTENDING OUR DEADLINE THROUGH MARCH 7, 2018 (COB). </strong></p>

<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REG08. In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the 1st through the 7th of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During the Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers. Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with RLP 18-REG08 and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease. All documents can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND<br />Ft Peck Dam is located in northeast Montana on the Missouri river 2 miles northeast of Fort Peck, Montana. The project has 5 generating units split between two powerhouses for a combined generating capacity of 185.25 megawatts.<br />The crane is a Whiting 20 ton box girder, single trolley indoor overhead traveling type crane. The bridge spans the width of the operating floor and travels the entire length of the building in the north-south direction. The crane is operated from an open cab mounted just below the downstream crane bridge girder.<br />The overhead traveling crane is provided for the primary purpose of inspecting and maintaining the main control gate, the shaft and shaft liner, and the gate hoisting equipment. It is also used for lifting and transporting gate well covers, heavy machinery, heavy tools, and general maintenance work.<br />Whiting Crane (OEM) has stated that the intake shaft cranes at Ft. Peck are not authorized for use as personnel lifting device. EM 385-1-1 section 16.T.01 requires the crane manufacturer's approval for personnel lifts.</p>
<p>There is no roof access to allow for components to be hoisted off the trolley. Contractor will be prohibited from cutting an access hatch into the roof structure for hoisting from above.</p>
<p>The existing cab will be removed as part of this contract and be replaced with a standard open cab design.<br /><br />MECHANICAL DESIGN<br />Hoist motor will be replaced. The main hoist currently has one holding brake in conjunction with the mechanical load brake installed internally to the speed reducer. A secondary holding brake will be added as well as the replacement of the original holding brake. The removal of the oil coolers will allow room for the additional brake.</p>
<p>The current hoist speed reducers have mechanical load brakes installed. The mechanical load brake is allowed in an open loop control mode but must be disabled when switching to a closed loop flux vector mode. The ratchet pawl mechanism will be removed and the gear secured to the shaft. The cranes currently have oil coolers installed to dissipate the heat generated by the mechanical load brakes. After the load brakes have been disabled the oil coolers will no longer be needed and can be removed to allow for additional room for the installation of the secondary holding brakes.</p>
<p>Auxiliary hoist motors will be replaced. The auxiliary hoist currently has one holding brake mounted on the tail end of the motor that works in conjunction with the mechanical load brake integral to the speed reducer. The existing brake will be replaced when the auxiliary hoist gearmotor is replaced.</p>
<p>Aux hoist will remain in open loop mode. Upper weighted limit switch are to be added to the aux hoist. Drive motor will be replaced. Bridge and trolley brakes will be replaced.</p>
<p>ELECTRICAL DESIGN <br />The contractor will perform engineering and design for modernized control and ancillary power systems and submit design computations, product data, reports, and drawings for approval. After completion of work, the Contractor will perform acceptance testing and commissioning including load testing at 125% of rated capacity. Submittals of as-built drawings, product data, as-commissioned software/parameters, and O&amp;M manuals will be provided by the Contractor. Training will be provided by the contractor and focus on familiarization with the VFD and controls as well as recommended preventative maintenance practices.</p>
<p>MOTORS AND BRAKES<br />Existing motors are wound rotor AC machines with the rotor secondary slip rings shorted to mimic a squirrel cage machine; this is not recommended for VFD applications. The main hoist, auxiliary hoist, bridge, and trolley motors will continuous rated inverter duty motors (Class H insulation is required). The main hoist motor encoder will be replaced in conjunction with motor and brake replacement. Motors will be sized to provide hoist and travel speeds approximately equal to the existing crane. The auxiliary hoist will require use of a separate or integral speed reducer (gearmotor).</p>
<p>The main hoist load brake will be disabled to allow for closed-loop flux vector control and the existing brake will be removed. Two holding brakes will be provided for the main hoist. AC electro-hydraulic thruster or DC armature actuated shoe brakes will be specified for the Contractor's design. Each hoist brake will be rated and adjusted to a minimum of 125% full load motor torque. One of the brakes for the main hoist drivetrain will set after a short time delay.</p>
<p>The existing auxiliary hoist motor encoder (currently unused) will be removed. The auxiliary hoist load brake will remain enabled and a single holding brake (motor- mounted disc brake) will be used; the auxiliary hoist will operate in an open loop (sensor-less) control scheme.</p>
<p>Spring set, electrically released bridge and trolley holding brakes will be provided. Disc or shoe brakes will be allowed, based on the contractor's design. Brakes will be rated and adjustable to 100% full load motor torque and set to CMAA 70 standards. Anti- condensation brake heaters will be provided for any enclosed disk brakes.</p>
<p>VARIABLE FREQUENCY DRIVES<br />Crane motion controls will be provided with crane-specific variable frequency drives (VFDs) and related equipment with latest, still manufactured, controls. A closed loop, flux vector control regime will be used the main hoist; an open loop, vector control scheme will be used for the auxiliary hoist, trolley and bridge functions.</p>
<p>Each crane motion can be operated independently and simultaneously of each other crane function. The existing pendant control will be retained with three speeds in each direction for each function.</p>
<p>All new panels and enclosures will be minimum NEMA Type 12, or equivalent (cranes are indoors). All panels and enclosures will be climate controlled, utilizing anti- condensation heaters and fans required to maintain environmental conditions acceptable for enclosed electronic devices. Keypads displaying VFD operating parameters and fault codes will be provided on the enclosure doors.</p>
<p>Dynamic braking will be provided for each VFD. Dynamic braking resistors will be corrosion-resistant and have a thermal capacity NEMA Class rating of 160 minimum.</p>
<p>Line reactors, load reactors, and isolation transformers will be installed per recommendations of the VFD manufacturer.</p>
<p>All crane function VFDs will have a slow speed feature (i.e. "Micro-Speed") which limits motor operation to a preset maximum (initially set at 25%) to assist in precision movements of the crane. With slow speed enabled, master switch operation will correspond with 0 to 25% of base speed. A single two-position, maintained selector switch (SLOW-NORMAL) on the cab control console will enable slow speed functionality for all crane motions.</p>
<p>OPERATOR CONTROLS<br />The new cab will provide a console positioned to provide a more ergonomic means of viewing directly below the cab while standing at the console controls. Infinitely variable, step-less (no detents) master switches will be provided on a new cab control console.<br />Controls for crane power, emergency stop, speed regime (slow, normal), pendant cable reel (LOWER-RAISE) and the warning horn will be provided. A two-position, maintained selector switch (CAB-PENDANT) will be provided in the cab to select operation between cab console and radio remote control. If in the PENDANT selection, cab stop and emergency stop buttons will still be functional. Another maintained switch will be provided for use of the personnel platform, enabling the personnel platform emergency stop to function when the platform cable reel is connected.</p>
<p>The contractor will perform commissioning and load testing with drive OEM support. The load test will consist of 100% rated capacity full dynamic load test for both hoists including bridge and trolley motion at rated main hoist capacity. A static 125% capacity load test will test new mechanical drive train components.</p>
<p>Upon completion of rehabilitation work, the Contractor will provide (as an optional bid item) a Letter of Personnel Hoist Certification.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation RFQ 36C10E18Q0105 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to issue one Firm Fixed Price Purchase Orders for the below line items to the responsible contractor whose quote, conforming to the solicitation, is considered the Best Value offer. Award will be made on an all or none basis. A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.
The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular
