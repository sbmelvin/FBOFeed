DESCRIPTION: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD TO A SOLE-SOURCE LARGE BUSINESS VENDOR under FAR Part 13 procedures.   The Department of Veterans Affairs Great Lakes Acquisition Contracting Office 12 (NCO 12) intends to award on a sole source basis with Abiomed, Inc. (DUNS: 050636737), pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and FAR 13.106-3.   In Accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), the Justification and Approval for Sole Source is placed in the Contracting Officers contract files. 

This procurement, in accordance with FAR 13, is a temporary (  6 hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in elective or urgent, hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the ImpellaÂ® 2.5 in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability which can result from repeat episodes of reversible myocardial ischemia that occur during planned, temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events.  The CO conducted market research and found that Abiomed is the only source that can provide the following items:  


        Ventricle Assist Device System-Impella 2.5 CP Pump Sets and Controller

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:

1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required,  including, 
where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
 2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
 3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
 4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.
5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.
6.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality  of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
7.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
 8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete  architectural and engineering services.

Evaluation factors 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be evaluated using the following adjectival ratings as follows:

Outstanding: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low. 
Good: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low. 
Acceptable: Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is moderate.  
Marginal: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high. 
Unacceptable: Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is not awardable. The firm s proposal demonstrates a misunderstanding of the requirement and the approach fails to meet performance standards. The firm s proposal has major omissions and inadequate details to assure evaluators that the offeror has an understanding of requirement.

The ratings identified below were used in the evaluation of Past Performance (Criterion 4):

Substantial Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. No doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.

Satisfactory Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Little doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they could satisfy the requirements of the contract.
Unknown Confidence (Neutral): No recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror s performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.
Limited Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Some doubt exists based on past performance that they could satisfy the terms and conditions of the contract.
No Confidence: Based on the offeror s recent/relevant performance record, the Government has little expectations that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. Significant doubt exists based on the offeror s past performance that they can satisfy the requirements of the contract.
