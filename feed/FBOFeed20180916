<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/ solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and no other solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a Class Limited Source Justification requirement for renewal of an existing tower rental space for DEA equipment. The requirement is for use and support for the period of 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019 (see attached Request for Quotation). The Class Limited Source Justification for Antenna Sites provides justification for other than full and open competition and is included as an attachment. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 531120, Lessors of Non Residential Buildings. This synopsis/solicitation is an unrestricted acquisition.</p>
<p>Solicitation 15DDHQ18Q00000238 is a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and incorporates Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-100 (see RFQ included with this synopsis/solicitation). The government intends to award a firm-fixed price award based on the lowest price technically acceptable quote subject to a satisfactory past performance record. The lowest priced quote will be evaluated first; if not found acceptable, the next lowest priced quote will be evaluated, and so on until an acceptable quote is identified. The government will not review higher priced quotes if the lowest priced quote is determined to be technically acceptable. For an offeror to be considered technically acceptable, it shall be able to provide the items required meeting the salient physical characteristics identified in the solicitation. In addition, the contractor must have a satisfactory past performance record for quality and timely delivery of the requirements items. All sources shall provide ALL OR NONE in response to this RFQ.</p>
<p>The only acceptable method for submission of technical questions and/or quotes is electronic submission by e-mail to Mr. Richard Thibeault at richard.r.thibeault@usdoj.gov. For administrative questions related to the synopsis/solicitation call 202-307-7811. Reference the solicitation number in the subject line of the RFQ response. The deadline for questions is at 12:00 PM EST on Tuesday, 18 September 2018. The Contracting Officer will determine if posting of any amendments is necessary as applicable. Quotes are due no later than 2:00PM EST on Thursday, 20 September 2018. The Government will not accept late submissions (questions and/or quotes) unless determined to be in the best interest of the government by the Contracting Officer prior to award. This solicitation does not commit the Government to pay any costs incurred in the submission of quotes or to contract for the supplies/services.</p>

Component means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.
Cost of components means –
