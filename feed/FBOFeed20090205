<DESC><p>Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT) Spiral 2
<p>FA9101-09-RFI-0001</p>
<p>5 February 2009<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION:<br />The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning a Space Threat Assessment Testbed (STAT). The STAT is a testbed facility that will be used to test space system survivability against natural, environmental, and man-made effects. STAT will provide connectivity to a Satellite Operation Center (SOC) for systems under test in order to train space operators to recognize threats and aid in the development of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to mitigate the effects of those threats. STAT will include space chambers with realistic natural space environmental conditions, as well as integrated representative threat sources. STAT Spiral 1 is currently developing the technology to integrate and control the various environmental sources and build a capability to test subsystem size components and microsats. STAT Spiral 2 will scale up the STAT Spiral 1 capability to accommodate an entire satellite or a full-scale mockup with the key subsystems installed. This program includes efforts to design, develop, procure, and install modifications to the existing Mark 1 space chamber in order to create STAT Spiral 2 at Arnold AFB TN. HQ AFSPC, AFOTEC, and MDA have endorsed the need for a STAT capability within the Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB). All manufacturers that propose a bid to design and build the STAT must have experience in space test facility design and integration and preferably some experience with facility modification. The vendor must comply with all military specifications on systems engineering and material used in the system. Upon completion of the effort, the facility and all designs, drawings, and proprietary rights to the project will be relinquished and turned over to the United States Air Force.</p>
<p>1. SCOPE.<br />This request for information is directed to competitive potential prime contractors who have demonstrated experience in the design, development, and integration of new satellite test capabilities and modification of existing satellite test capabilities. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this RFI to refine potential Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and acquisition strategies for the STAT. Further, this information will help the Government identify and document the capability requirements and structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES. <br />The main objectives in this project are as follows:<br />1. Design the STAT Spiral 2 facility.<br />2. Develop integrated environmental source and infrastructure control systems. <br />3. Procure all necessary hardware that is not provided as government furnished equipment (GFE).<br />4. Integrate the environmental sources, chamber subsystems, controls, SOC links, and security systems into a functional test capability.<br />5. Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) security requirements apply <br />&emsp;</p>
<p>3. REQUIREMENTS.<br />The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall have real-time capability for emulating the natural and man-made space environment at various orbital conditions. It shall also incorporate three operationally realistic man-made threat sources and the ability to connect the System Under Test (SUT) to a SOC. The following are operational and system specifications or limitations applicable to the design and development of this System:</p>
<p>3.1 Operational: The Space Threat Assessment Testbed shall emulate a complex natural and man-made space environment to include realistic flux levels and/or fluences of the atomic oxygen, low energy protons, electrons, UV, contamination, and spacecraft charging. It will also include three operationally relevant threat sources and the ability to connect the payload to the SOC.<br /><br />3.1.1 The system shall emulate the appropriate conditions for orbits, ranging from Low Earth Orbit to Geosynchronous and Sun-Synchronous orbits.<br /><br />3.1.2 The System shall have the capability to operate the threat sources and the environmental sources in a controlled manner to simulate realistic combined environmental conditions experienced by operational systems.</p>
<p>3.1.3 The system shall allow the connection of the SUT to be connected to a remote SOC and shall monitor the data streams being fed over the control networks to ensure they meet all applicable standards and regulations.</p>
<p>3.1.4 The system shall allow real-time control of all sources to allow scripting of environmental and/or induced anomaly situations to be simulated.</p>
<p>3.2 Chamber Infrastructure: The Mark 1 Chamber and the surrounding building and supporting infrastructure located at Arnold Engineering Development Center will be made available as GFE for this effort. Integration of new or existing vacuum pumping and cryogenic systems, as well as development of an integrated control system, shall be accomplished by the contractor. Electrical Power (up to 440V 3-phase), water, compressed air, and dry Nitrogen are all available through the existing building infrastructure.</p>
<p>3.3 Natural Environment Sources:</p>
<p>3.3.1 The system shall include atomic oxygen generation capabilities that simulate energy levels and fluxes representative of the levels experienced in Low Earth Orbits.</p>
<p>3.3.2 The system shall include low energy proton acceleration capabilities that simulate fluences seen at solar max.</p>
<p>3.3.3 The system shall include UV lamps capable of simulating the solar spectra at solar intensity.</p>
<p>3.3.4 The system shall include electron acceleration capabilities that simulate trapped electrons.<br /><br />3.4 Threat Sources: The system shall include three operationally relevant threat sources capable of simulating the effects of those threats on the satellite.</p>
<p>3.5 Connectivity to SOC: The System shall allow the payload to be connected to a SOC. This connection will allow integrated operational test and evaluation, crew training, anomaly resolution utilizing actual hardware, the development of TTPs, and assessment of system-level vulnerabilities to natural and induced environments.</p>
<p>3.6 Prototype and Related Hardware: AEDC's existing Characterization of Combined Orbital Surface Effects (CCOSE) and STAT Spiral 1 Chambers represent subscale prototypes and risk reduction efforts. These facilities, and the technologies incorporated into them, will be made available to the contractor for use in the development of the STAT Spiral 2 facility.</p>

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA) by the 950th Electronic Systems Group (950 ELSG), Hanscom AFB MA, for a non-competitive follow-on contract for the Airborne Broadcast Intelligence and Combat Track II (ABI/CTII) System Sustainment to be negotiated with McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of The Boeing Company, 15059 Conference Center Drive, Chantilly, VA.
The new contract for the ABI and CTII support requirement will enable the current contractor to provide continued sustainment support of the ABI and CTII systems to include disposal of the ABI system(s).  This support includes training, hardware/software enhancements, modifications, integration and retrofits; execution; assessment; and disposal.  The contract will also have provisions for the procurement of CTII systems to include deployment, site surveys, assembly, test, integration and installation. Foreseeable deployments include support to Mobility Air Forces (MAF) and Combat Air Forces (CAF) aircraft. The contractor is also responsible for depot-level support for garrisoned and deployed hardware/software maintenance, repair and return to the user. The software in the ABI and CTII Systems is the Tracker software.  This software provides the user with an interface which displays all data to the cockpit; supports the collection and processing of the position reports, chat applications, and tracks and threats; supports the Tracker Network Hub that links the UHF SATCOM footprints into a single global situational awareness picture and; supports the Hub Clients that allow SIPR-connected workstations to access the Tracker network without a radio which is critical to Air Operations Centers (AOCs) and Wing commanders.  The Tracker software runs on Windows machines in the Control and Relay Station (CRS), typically installed on the ground at an AOC, and in any of the In-Transit Units (ITUs), which are usually aircraft, but could also be ground-based.  The CRS establishes the Tracker network within a UHF SATCOM footprint and ITUs within that footprint automatically log-on to that network.  The Tracker software, which consists of approximately one million source lines of code, is proprietary to The Boeing Company.  The Boeing Company ported the software to use modern higher-level languages (C++) several years ago, and has developed the Tracker Network Hub and the Hub Client software.  Therefore, The Boeing Company is the only contractor able to perform the requested effort. 
Please submit responses via e-mail to diane.oneil@hanscom.af.mil, Heidi.bosinger-waldron@hanscom.af.mil, and  john.whichelow@hanscom.af.mil no later than 2:00 PM EST, 27 February 2009.  Please direct any question regarding this synopsis to Diane O'Neil, Contracting Officer, (781) 266-1050 or Capt John Whichelow, (781) 266-0547.
This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offers.  ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.

The Portable Guard Tower is a complete unit which includes one Guard Tower, one Conex Box, one pallet (75 coils or 3750 ft) of 18" Helix Coil, and a Wire Installation Kit. The Wire Installation Kit includes a Fence Driver, 25 5-foot stakes, and 25 7-foot stakes.  
The Guard Tower itself is manufactured with four separate wall units that allow for quick and easy assembly on top of the standard Conex Box. Once placed on the Conex Box the Guard Tower will be approximately 12 feet in the air, giving the guards a greater view of the perimeter or area of threat. Once in position, the walls are filled from the top using sand as ballast. The sand filled walls provide the guards inside with 360 degrees of protection from 9mm, 5.56, and 7.62 threats. 12? dumps are provided for easy removal of the ballast allowing the Guard Tower to be repositioned as needed. 
The overhead cover is 3/4m plywood on which lights, sensors, and antennae can be installed if desired. Access to the cover can be reached through a hatch type door that is pre-installed for convenience. The CBP Guard Tower eliminates the time and the mess associated with using sandbags. This product is a recoverable asset that can be broken down and deployed inside the Conex Box.
All parts and tools needed for assembly are included in the kit bag. Stakes are also provided for the Concertina Wire installation.

<DESC>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Office of Science and Technology (OST), Information Services Division (ISD) requires a utility software package to convert Oracle forms 6i, menus, associated program libraries, and reports compatible with Oracle middle tier 10g and database 11g. 

The utility software package shall be compatible with the following:
Windows X86 computers (XP, Vista, and Server 2003) and/or Unix Solaris Operating System (SPARC 64 bit) (version 10); Oracle 10g (10.1.2.0.2); the current Oracle forms builder 6i (version 6.0.8.25.2); and the new Oracle Forms Builder 10g (version 10.1.2.0.2).

The utility software package shall trap and provide any mechanism to fix de-supported constructs; deploy migrated forms on the web; be limited to no changes in coding conventions and no hard coding of paths; allow forms to attach to the program libraries during compilation; deploy ICON files; and update Forms-Module References during the migration process. 

The utility software package shall upgrade the numerous reports generated from forms using the run_report call.

The vendor, through its expertise, shall provide technical ability and advice for resolving issues the utility package is unable to resolve, eg, providing prototype procedures and advice for using webutil integration between Oracle forms and Microsoft word templates that merge forms data  with a word template and then print the merged documents.

If there is a discovery that web enabled forms have a different look and feel, ATF requires an enterprise solution to quickly fix this, also a mechanism to resolve any unsupported fonts and key mappings.

The utility software shall allow for automating any correction of problems found and allow the user to create new search/replace templates which incorporate the rules/standards of each individual client. These templates shall be executed during the migration process. 
  
Web enabled forms support pull down menus so any block, full screen, or lotus style menus must be recoded. The utility software must identify the unsupported menus and automatically replace these with the new menus during the migration process

The utility software shall provide a means to analyze and suggest improvements in dealing with post query triggers that may require additional round trips to the application server for each row retrieved, promoting object similarities, and analyze the applications to identify objects that can use default values.

The utility software package may either convert in tandem with Oracle migration assistant or on its own.

All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration prior to award.  All responses are due via email to amanda.boshears@atf.gov by February 9, 2009 at 10AM Eastern Time.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures, a sole source purchase order to Comanche Nation, 584 NW Bingo Road, Lawton, OK  73507-1214 for the following services, under NAICS Code 921150.  The purpose of this effort is to award a contract to a Tribal College and University (TCU) to provide a 12-month training program that will lead to the certification of new health insurance billing coders and re-certification of existing billing coders.  As part of this initiative, the TCU will provide necessary outreach to enroll students in the program, and identify their individual coding skills as advanced, intermediate or beginner.  Individuals to be targeted for the outreach and training are those who work for tribal providers as billing coders or perform related tasks. Those identified as advanced will be provided with the proper training necessary to become a candidate for the AHIMA Certified Coding Specialist Certification Exams.  Under this Request for Contract to train medical coding and billing staff, a TCU will help us address two key initiatives:  (1) the Secretary’s initiative to reduce health disparities in targeted vulnerable communities: and (2) CMS’strategic plan goal to improve access to quality care. This training is necessary to meet the demand for coding services created by the growing utilization of Medicare and Medicaid programs in tribal communities and the ongoing policy and procedural changes made in these programs that impact payment and billing practices. The TCU will provide students skills in ICD9 and CPT4 coding to achieve certification through one of the billing coding certification entities such as the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC).  The TCU will also be available to conduct training to permit existing coders to maintain certification by providing the latest information on procedural and policy changes and the concepts of the ICD10 coding system.  By making adequately trained billing coders available, CMS will contribute to improving timeliness of payments to IHS and tribal providers and assuring that payment is made for all the covered services they provide.  These improvements will allow fledgling Indian Health Services (HIS) and tribal providers in rural, remote and frontier areas to have funding available to maintain health care services needed by their patients.  While IHS providers are also in need of this training, this effort will focus on tribal providers for two reasons: (1) IHS has an existing training program for its providers and (2) the number of tribal providers is increasing sharply as more tribes use the authorities available to them to operate their own programs.  Interested students who are neither employees of a tribal provider nor IHS employees can also participate in the training.  This procurement should be awarded to the Comanche Nation (CN) because no other sources will satisfy agency requirements given the unique nature of the Presidential Executive Order requiring Federal agencies to assist TCUs in accessing Federal resources.  This contract focuses upon establishing and continuing a program to train billing coders within tribal communities using TCU and tribal resources within those communities.  CN is the most capable of providing these trainings in these communities given that many of the tribal colleges are very small institutions and do not have sufficient staff support to meet the demands of a project such as this without extensive startup funding.  CN has a proven track record of success with CMS of conducting such training and effectively using its current administrative capacity.  CN can thus conduct a reasonable number of trainings for the amount of funding available for this effort.  Additionally, one of the critical factors in this training program is acquiring an adequate number of students in order to institute the training program.  Because CN is located in Oklahoma, where the largest number of tribes in the continental United States is located, it has access to a large potential student pool necessary for this effort.  CN also has strong relations with other tribal colleges located in Oklahoma and can thus make arrangements to train students at other locations other than on the main campus of the college while at the same time remaining firmly within the tribal community.  Additionally, CN has proven access to staff trained in the provision of billing coding with an emphasis on CMS issues. All responsible sources may submit a response, which, if received timely, must be considered by the agency.  Expression of interest and statement of capabilities must be email to Lucille.Lee@cms.hhs.gov.  Statement of capabilities must be received within 5 days from the published date of this notice.  In addition, all interested contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>A) The offeror shall provide the government, with its offer submission, written verification from the GSA schedule holder that an agreement exists that validates the offeror's right to offer the GSA schedule items on behalf of the GSA schedule holder, if other than the offeror; and,  B) By proactively complying with this offer term, sellers accept that the government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee.  Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.")<BR><BR>IRM/SMART requires the Mercury automated testing products and services to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name justification, no one vendor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this Justification.  Rather, the products identified by the brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that maximize the Government's existing investment.  The rationale for this brand name only justification is based on several factors.  A foundational consideration is that the nature of performance testing technology is highly specialized, requiring a significant investment in staffing and training in any given product.  While there are competing products that have similar functionality, the knowledge and expertise to use each system is not easily transferable.  The cost in training, experience and project delay would be significant and far outweigh any potential savings to the government.  The next factor in consideration is the fact that Mercury has a proven track record on the SMART program.  Mercury was used during an early laboratory test of SMART, and successfully tested a simulation of 1,500 concurrent users, accessing a prescribed set of SMART business activities.  This complex test revealed shortcomings in the earlier SMART solution allowing the Government to make major course corrections in the design and architecture of the system.  Since then, the program has leveraged the Mercury automated test suite within its test environment.  Additional licenses are now needed to continue forward with automated testing within the prgram's unclassified test environment.<BR><BR>

Futron developed andmaintains the Integrated Risk Management Application (IRMA) software that was originallydeployed for the NASA Space Station program. The software application is now also used tosupport risk management for the NASA Space Shuttle program and several other majorprograms/projects including elements of the NASA Constellation Program. Because IRMA wasdeveloped under government contracts, there are no yearly licensing charges or fees forits use. This represents a cost savings. Additionally, because the tool was developed todirectly support the NASA risk management process so no significant tailoring or uniquedevelopment is needed to support the GOES-R Project. The NASA continuous risk managementprocess and paradigm are the baseline process for the GOES-R Project. The IRMA risk database tool has NASA risk management heritage ensuring compatibility withrisk management paradigm adopted by GOES-R and required minimal tailoring and isgenerally considered easy to use.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Surveillance Research Program (CSRP) plans to procure services in supporting the Northwest Tribal Registry Project with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB), 527 SW Hall, Suite 300 Portland, OR 97201.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>The Northwest Tribal Registry (NTR) Project was developed in January 1999 by the tribally operated epidemiology program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) in Portland, Oregon.  The Tribal Registry uses state of the art record linkage studies to increase the quality of health status surveillance data, especially for chronic diseases such as cancer, among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to enable the Northwest Tribal Registry Project (NTR) to continue its activities to ascertain more accurate estimates of the occurrence of cancer among Northwest American Indians and Alaskan Natives and to expand and enhance the composition of the Registry (e.g., inclusion of patient rosters from the Seattle IHB) to improve its completeness  and representativeness.  The NTR shall continue to inform the state registries with which it links of racial misclassification, and work to incorporate the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of Seattle, WA, in the linkage process directly.</p>
<p>The Northwest Tribal Registry Project serves the upper northwest region of the U.S. and is the central point for data linkage for over 40 Indian tribes.</p>
<p>The Northwest Tribal Registry collected complete data from 1996-2005 for Idaho, Oregon and Washington. By virtue of the linkages with the Tribal Registry, the registry identified over 3,000  incident AI/AN cancer cases for analysis during the nine-year period. The Registry Project has analyzed these linkages, including residual cases (i.e., those cases for which an individual is classified as AI/AN in the state cancer registry, but for which there is no record in the Tribal Registry), and using U.S. Census estimates (specifically the National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race estimates) as denominators, thus allowing for an even more comprehensive description of cancer burden among Northwest AI/AN.  These data have been analyzed in preparation for development of publications to be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.  No entity other than the NPAIHB Registry has access to these data or the analyses.</p>
<p>The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) is uniquely qualified to perform the required activities. The ability to provide more complete and accurate cancer data for Northwest AI/AN is dependent upon the successful and mutually beneficial relationships that have developed between this organization, its tribal members, and the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington State Cancer Registries.  The NPAIHB conducted repeat data linkages with all three state registries to obtain complete data through 2005.  No other entity has such a relationship with the three state cancer registries and the Native American tribal governments in the Northwest Portland Area.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 19, 2009.

<DESC><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite and Data (NESDIS) has a requirement for (a) Comparative Analysis of Sea Ice Motion using the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) as compared to the Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing Systems (AMSR-E) and (b) a spatial forecast tool for operational use in generating 30 to 90 day outlooks for the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas region. NOAA intends to negotiate this requirement on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado pursuant to the authority of Title 41 United States Code, Section 253(c)(1). The University of Colorado is the only source known to be capable of performing this technical support because the University of Colorado has developed the algorithm software for both the SSM/I and AMSR-E and the software is not available to anyone else to work with and the University of Colorada has also developed the operational automated spatial sea-ice forecast system. Since the AMSM-E instrument is nearing the end of its planned mission life the University of Colorado will develop an overlap between AMSR-E and SSM/I to recalibrate and improve the SSM/I retrievals. The technical support will take place for a period of one year after award. Also, refinement of the spatial forecasting system developed by the National Snow and Ice Data Center and then transition it to an operational setting at National Ice Center to provide the capability to more easily generate spatial 30- to 90-day outlooks for the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas region. The technical support will take place for a period of one year after award. The place of performance will be on-site at University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado. The University of Colorado has the unique operational knowledge of the software. The University of Colorado has ready access to the archival data because they maintain and use the algorithm for both SSM/I and AMSR-E and can perform a quick and comprehensive reanalysis. NAICS Code is 541712, size standard is 500 employees. Although NOAA expects that only the University of Colorado can provide the required technical support, all responsible sources may submit a statement of capabilities which shall be considered by the Government. Information submitted in response to this notice must be in sufficient detail to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. Responses to this notice may be submitted via e-mail to mary.a.watson@noaa.gov no later than 12 noon on 2/20/09. A determination by Government to not open this requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the Government's discretion. Failure to submit documentation of capabilities (as described) will result in the Government proceeding as stated.</p>

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) intends to issue a Solicitation for Letters of Interest (LOI) to U.S. Small Businesses for the development of prototype photovoltaic (PV) modules and pilot production. This LOI is in support of U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Solar America Initiative (SAI). Authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the SAI represents a significant enhancement of DOE's business strategy of partnering with the U.S. industry to accelerate commercialization of PV system research and development (R&D) to meet aggressive cost and installed capacity goals. This Solicitation is targeted at innovative R&D on PV cell and module prototypes with demonstrated functionality in either large-area cell/module form or, preferably, prototypes produced in pilot-scale operations. The emphasis on proposed activities should be on the barriers to manufacturing scale-up and 2012 commercialization. The primary objective of this program is to shorten the timeline for companies to transition prototype and pre-commercial PV technologies into pilot and full-scale manufacture. Responders to this Solicitation are expected to focus their efforts on a limited number of high impact areas that lie on the critical path to scaling-up their technology to full manufacture. The minimum entrance criterion is demonstrated PV cells or process lab devices or modules. The successful exit criterion is for prototype modules and pilot production demonstration >5MW/year. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that 6 to 10 subcontracts, up to $3M each, will be awarded as 18-month phased subcontracts. A Net Conference regarding the project is scheduled for Monday, March 6, 2009, 9:30 A.M. Mountain Time. The Solicitation will be available to view/download on or about February 16, 2009 from NREL's website at: http://www.nrel.gov/business_opportunities/solicitations_rfps.html.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<CONTACT>Adam Tuchman 401-832-1909 Leslie Brazil; 401-832-1437
<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment Newport, RI intends to make a sole source award to Adaptive Methods, Centreville, VA for services in support of testing of a SURTASS Headline and Roll Control (SHARC) production unit. The task requires the integration of the SHARC with a GFE instrumentation package.   The work requires review of the NUWC supplied tow rig design in order to ensure that the design is mechanically compatible with the SHARC.  It also requires contractor assistance in performing bench top and in water tow testing of the SHARC.  Tasking is expected to require 316 hours of Systems Engineer labor, with a period of performance through 31 December 2009.  The solicitation is expected to be released no earlier than 19 February 2009.
The basis for the sole source is that Adaptive Methods developed and tested the SURTASS SHARC tow body, which is currently in use as part of the SURTASS system.  The contractor is thus the only vendor who has the knowledge to integrate the instrumentation package with their product, SHARC.  
The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>USAID/CAR Regional Mission intends to issue a solicitation for one cost-reimbursement fixed fee contract for an Agricultural Development Project to be implemented in Tajikistan.  The period of performance is anticipated to be three years, beginning on or about July 31, 2009. 

The overall goal of this program is to increase the productivity of traditional agricultural crops and expand agricultural profitability.  The approach will address basic needs in food insecure areas and have enough flexibility to support post-harvest processing wherever needed and feasible.

The program’s activities will be focused in western Khatlon, Sughd region and districts in proximity of Dushanbe.  Western Khatlon is geographically isolated and the least developed part of the country with high concentration of poverty and cotton debts.  As cotton is a traditional crop in the region it is essential to offer farmers opportunities to expand their knowledge in agricultural techniques and markets to assist them in increasing production of food crops primarily to address food security issues.  The region also has a competitive advantage with its warmer climate and shorter winter making it suitable for production of high value crops such as lemons, watermelons and melons, onions and others.

The Fergana Valley area in the Sughd region and the surrounding districts of Dushanbe have stronger productive potential to respond to market-driven opportunities and compete in local markets in order to reduce food imports and expand the existing export market.  Activities in these regions will focus on improving the quality, processing and marketing of produce and commodities.  The activity may also be implemented in other regions of the country such as the Rasht Valley.

The contractor will work with the private sector to expand and improve production and to add value for local and regional markets through: 
a) Work with private sector input suppliers and farmers to expand access to inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, equipment and livestock, to increased productivity. 
b) Work with private financial institutions (or suppliers/processors if appropriate) to improve the access of farmers to finance (inputs).
c) Work with key private sector counterparts (farmers and processors) to identify and introduce improved practices for grading and sorting, improved packaging and more effective branding.
d) Work with key private sector counterparts to identify and introduce improved practices for processing and implementation of quality standards and certifications.
e) Work with key business service providers and trade associations to enhance their effectiveness in supporting increased agricultural production and sales.

Proposals will provide a clear set of illustrative, sequenced, and prioritized list of activities that clearly show how implementing their proposed technical approach will contribute to: 
•Improving access to agricultural inputs
•Improving access to credit (including leasing, inputs)
•Expanding sales
•Increasing investment
•Adoption of productivity enhancing technologies and techniques
•Implementation of quality standards and certifications

Only organizations/companies registered in Tajikistan will be eligible for award as prime contractor.  USAID strongly encourage interesting organizations/companies to start the registration process.
The estimated cost of the contract over the three year period is about $9.5 million.  It is anticipated that RFP for this work will be issued on/about April, 2009 and that award will be made on or before July 31, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District (NWP) is contemplating a sealed bid solicitation, via </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">full and open competition. leading to an award for the <strong>Julia Butler Hansen (JBH) National Wildlife Refuge </strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">Habitat Restoration</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">The Magnitude of Construction for this project will be between $1,000,000.00 to </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">$5,000,000.00</span></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">The proposed project is located on the JBH NWR within the Columbia River estuary. Located in</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">southwestern Washington and northwestern Oregon, the JBH NWR was established in 1972 specifically to protect </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and manage the federally endangered Columbian white-tailed deer. The refuge contains over 5,600 acres of </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">pastures, forested tidal swamps, brushy woodlots, marshes, and sloughs along the Columbia. The mainland </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">portion of the JBH NWR is bordered by the Columbia River and Steamboat Slough to the west, the Elochoman </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">River to the south, Brooks Slough to the north, and Washington Highway 4 to the east. Construction of the project </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">will include installation, replacement and/or modification of culverts and tide gates through flood control levees at the 7 sloughs on JBH NWR including associated features such as interior log booms, sheet pile headwalls, and rip rap </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">at culverts for erosion protection, and interior and exterior channel construction. Construction will also include </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">restoration of a sinuous channel for a portion of Risk Creek that travels through JBH NWR. The overall project </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">intent is to provide anadromous fish access and egress and fisheries habitat improvements. The side-hinged </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">restrained (hydraulic) tide gate proposed for use would allow for improved discharge of interior waters, and due to </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">its unique capabilities, allow for inflow of tidal waters during flood tides to a preset level prior to tide gate closure. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">This would allow for ingress and egress of juvenile salmonids plus improvement of fisheries habitat/water quality </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">parameters over existing conditions through greater exchange of interior and exterior waters. The tide gates would </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">be operated in a manner to maintain existing habitat conditions for Columbian white-tailed deer. The conservation </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">and management of a secure and viable population of these deer represents the primary purpose for the JBH </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">NWR. The proposed culverts and tide gates, post-flood event, would provide for a faster return to the status quo </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">for interior water levels compared to the existing conditions thus benefiting deer by limiting exposure to flood </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">waters. Detailed specification will be inclusive in the solicitation package. A Site Safety and Health Officer </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">(SSHO) shall be provided for all new contracts with the Portland District. For this project, the person that will act </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">as the SSHO is required to have a minimum of 3 years safety work with similar projects and a 30 hour OSHA </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">construction safety class, or equivalent, taken with the last 3 years. The SSHO may have no other duties for this </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;">work except function as the on-site CQC Manager.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

This SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE is to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide biological resource repository support services to DMID and DMID-supported investigators. Activities include receipt, acquisition, authentication, production, preservation, storage, and distribution of approximately 15,000 unique organisms and reagents; inventory and tracking system; quality assurance program; outreach activities; and a web portal.

The information from this market research will help the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) plan their acquisition strategy.  Please be sure to indicate if you have a GSA schedule contract, a contract on GSA 8(a) STARS, or a contract on GSA VETS GWAC.

THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH.  The DMID, NIAID, NIH WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS MARKET RESEARCH.

BACKGROUND

Research supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat, and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by all infectious agents other than HIV, including research to counter bioterrorism. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.  

Toward this aim, DMID supports an array of research services. Included are programs that make preclinical and clinical translational research services, as well as organisms and state-of the art reagents, DNA sequencing, data and analytic tools, and biocontainment and core facilities, available to investigators (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid/). For the most part, these services are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID seeks now, however, to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities.

Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources Program (hereinafter called the Biological Research Resources Program). The Biological Research Resources Program will integrate and consolidate the functions currently carried out by numerous NIAID-supported repositories (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/resources/dmid/repos.htm). Of these currently supported programs, five concentrate on targeted groups of bacteria (Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, resistant staphylococci, respiratory pathogens, and mycobacteria responsible for tuberculosis and leprosy); one is dedicated to emerging viruses and arboviruses; one focuses on Aspergillus species; and three are dedicated to individual parasites (filarial worms, schistosomes, and plasmodia). Another program focuses on NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). This program provides a comprehensive collection of research materials, including those deposited by other Government-supported research projects, to be made available to the biodefense and emerging infectious disease scientific communities.  Together, these collections contain approximately 15,000 unique catalog items and more than a half million units for distribution.

The Biological Research Resources Program is designed not only to meet the currently defined needs of scientific communities, but also to meet emerging needs for research materials as they are identified. The Biological Research Resources Program comprises multiple components. The Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Resources Repository (MID-BRR) will serve as a central repository that will provide one-stop shopping for the broad community of microbiology and infectious diseases researchers. The MID-BRR will receive, acquire, authenticate, produce, preserve, store and distribute most of the organisms and reagents needed to comprise the comprehensive collection. 

A separate and complementary Request for Proposal (RFP) is currently soliciting proposals for the Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program, which will provide the capacity to ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of organisms that must be grown in animals as well as reagents integral to research on these organisms. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will work closely with the MID-BRR. The MID-BRR will also serve as a repository for research materials produced by other Government-supported research projects and research service programs. The MID-BRR Contractor is expected to interact with these programs as well.

For the purposes of this contract, research materials include both organisms and reagents:

•	Organisms include, for example, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm) and NIAID designated emerging infectious disease agents or organisms (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/list.htm).

•	Reagents include, for example, biochemical, biologic, cellular, genomic, immunologic and molecular specimens and/or resources integral to research on these organisms.  Reagents may also refer to toxins and other agents such as prions; to antiviral and anti-infective drugs and therapeutics, chemicals, agents that modulate the immune system, vaccines, vaccine constructs and vaccine adjuvants, and diagnostic tools and kits for detection and measurement.

The Mobile Utilities Support Equipment (MUSE) Division of the The Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC) will use the responses to this sources sought synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions for the planned contract.  This Sources Sought announcement is a Market Survey for written information.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  After review of the responses submitted regarding this potential acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and in the Federal Business Opportunities (FEDBIZOPPS) websites, if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The MUSE Division provides medium, 5 kV, and low, 480 V, voltage transportable prime power diesel power plants (generators) for use by Department of Defense worldwide.  MUSE maintains a ready fleet of non tactical high (1800 RPM) and medium speed (720-900 RPM) transportable diesel generators 200 to 2500 kW.  The equipment consists of 2 stroke(Electro Motive Diesel, EMD) and 4 stroke(Cummins, Caterpillar) diesel engines, internal and external exhaust silencers, self and separately excited synchronous single bearing generators, analog and digital automatic voltage regulators, analog and digital governors, integral and separate ancillary systems (fuel, oil, coolant), metal enclosed and metal clad utility parallel generator control switchgear, motor control centers, ISO container and drop over aluminum and steel enclosures, structural steel sub-bases (drag skids), utility grade protective relaying, EPA Tier I and II certified engines, OEM and aftermarket analog and digital gener! ator controls and other components to comprise a fully self contained black start capable prime, continuous, or standby power plant.
The general Scope of Work is for the services and products necessary to accomplish equipment repair, or overhaul, or remanufacture or modernization, to include project management and quality control, of MUSE power plants.

<DESC>The U. S. Government currently occupies 1,856 rentable square feet of office and related use space located at 1126 Jackson Ave, Pascagoula, MS, under a soon to expire lease. The General Services Administration (GSA) plans to negotiate a succeeding lease at the current location for the same square footage, based on economic, mission, and other related factors. The Government will develop a cost benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making that determination the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications and non-productive agency down time.

<DESC>This notice is issued by The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, located in Menlo Park, California.  We are soliciting responses from interested parties to deliver one (1) X-Ray Pump Probe (XPP) detector mover robot that meet the following requirements:
The detector mover is required to position a custom, large area x-ray detector (1024 x 1024 pixels, approx. 200mm square) on / along spherical surfaces with radii ranging from 10 to 100 centimeters. The detector motion will be centered on pre-defined interaction points. The location of the center of spherical motion shall be within either of two regions separated by 600 millimeters nominal. The surface normal vector of the detector face center must point toward the pre-defined interaction point at all times. The rotation of the detector face about the motion radial vector must be accurately known at all times. Hardware systems and / or software programs must be developed and implemented to avoid defined “stay clear” areas. 

Baseline detector mover configuration is a six degree of freedom anthropomorphic industrial robot. Such a device must have the following minimum performance specifications:

Maximum total weight: <2670 N (~<600 Lbf)
Inverted (ceiling) mount capability
Usable work envelope: >1.4 meter 
Payload: >270 N (~>60.5 Lbf) with mass CG 165 mm from end of effector.
Repeatability of position: <100 micron (<+/-50)
Stability of position: <10 micron (<+/-5) for >1 hour
Power cycle stability: <20 micron (<+/-7.5) including transients

“Usable work envelope” is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum distance between joints 1 and 5.

All applicable values are measured with respect to the robot mounting surface and do not include additional support structure. All applicable values are evaluated at detector speeds not more than 200 mm per second. 

Vendors interested in performing this requirement are invited to provide the following information to SLAC Purchasing Office no later than 26 February 2009. The information may be submitted via email to the Contract Administrator at clam@slac.stanford.edu  or faxed to 650-926-8785.

<DESC>Contractor information is as follows:  Log Sec Group, LLC, 9400 Innovation Drive, Suite 120, Manassas VA, 20110.<BR><BR>The Department of the Army, Aberdeen Installation Contracting Division (AICD) at  Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD, formally known as the Department of the Army, Army Contracting Agency, Northern Region (ACA NR), Aberdeen Directorate of Contracting<BR>(APG DOC), intends to noncompetitively extend the final option year, Option Year 4 (OY4) for an additional 4 months under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency. <BR><BR>Background:<BR>The APG DOC awarded Log Sec Group contract W91ZLK-04-D-0007 with an effective date of April 1, 2004, to provide non-personal  Information Technology (IT) support services to five main customers. The acquisition plan submitted and approved by ACA NR Headquarters in  February 2004 included an estimated cost of $116M over a seven year period. The actual award period was reduced to five years (Base + Four Option Years). The total estimated cost of the five year period became approximately $63M. As the work progressed, additional support activities were added. Unforeseen requirements emerged that necessitated the use of this award for critical mission operations.  This multi-activity contract utilizes two different contract types: Firm Fixed Price effort and Time and Materials effort. Upon initial award the Directorate of Information Management (DOIM) portion of this contract was performance based and the other four customers (RDECOM, CHPPM, AEC and 20th Support) were non-performance based. After the base year, CHPPM became performance based. The service for the 20th Support were not required for OY 4.   <BR><BR>The first J&A was approved to exceed the value of the total award and OY 4 amounts.  Current award funding including all option years is approximately $101M.  Announcement of the J&A for an exception to full and open competition for execution of the final option year to Log Sec Group was posted via the Army Single Face to Industry on March 27, 2008.<BR><BR>Current:<BR>Option Year 4 will expire on March 31, 2009 and a second J&A is contemplated for  unusual and compelling reasons to extend OY 4 and continue Agency Information Technology Services and Support (AITSS) services with Log Sec Group, until a replacement award is completed. The 3 current customers (2 performance and 1 non-performance based) which are provided services through this AITSS contract are requesting the extension of OY 4 to prevent mission failure.  This extension will be for 4 months of continued AITSS services at a cost of approximately $5.6M.  The projected  total value of the contract is approximately $107M.  The required AITSS services to be performed during the additional 4 months have been identified as being within the scope of the contract.  The continuing contract type is firm fixed price effort and time & materials effort.  Fiscal Year 2009 Operations & Maintenance (O&M) funds are cited for use with this proposed action. All current and future requirements remain within the original scope of work for this award.  <BR><BR>Interested persons may identify their interest, in writing to the Government point of contact.  All responses received within 25 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers.  For specific questions, please contact the Acquisition Project Officer, thomas.campanajr@conus.army.mil <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, 1201 New York Avenue, NW, Washington DC for technical and analytical support services for the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Observations (IWGOO). The IWGOO manages the interagency coordination of the United States Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS), which is a coordinated network of people and technology that work together to generate and disseminate continuous data, information, models, products and services for our coastal waters, ecosystems, Great Lakes and oceans. The services required will support the IWGOO, whose purpose is to advise and assist the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology on matters related to ocean observations. There is no other entity that can provide the expertise and the data needed for this requirement in the time frame required. The COL is uniquely positioned to provide the multi-agency perspective required by the 17 federal agencies requesting these services. COL has been serving the IWGOO by providing expertise in areas of science, technologies, industry engagement, and user needs in the initial phases of the IWGOO priorities and work plan for FY2009. Through more than ten years of support to federal ocean observing programs, COL is well versed in interagency support, interagency and inter-sector meeting planning, and has the network in place to reach constituents key to the success of a National IOOS. If the government were to choose another vendor, the project would be delayed for 6 to 9 months while the vendor conducted research, developed new contacts and engagement strategies consistent with ocean priorities for all of the 17 IWGOO federal agencies. All 17 Federal Agencies have agreed to have COL coordinate the different agency perspectives into common IWGOO recommendations. Notwithstanding the Government's intent to negotiate this requirement on a single sole source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA. Responses must be received by noon, February 20, 2009. Responses may be emailed to Robin.Prather@noaa.gov or faxed to 301-713-0806.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information Notice: Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC), in support of the Joint Guam Program Office, is soliciting information from all sources related to the potential design, construction, and logistics effort proposed to support the relocation of Command, Air, Ground, and Logistics units of the III Marine Expeditionary Force (which includes approximately 8,000 service members and 9,000 family members) from Okinawa, Japan to Guam. The proposed construction effort also includes infrastructure and pier/waterfront facilities to construct a nuclear carrier-capable berth at Naval Base Guam. In addition, a U.S. Army Ballistic Missile Defense Task Force, consisting of approximately 630 service members and 950 family members, is proposed to be relocated on Guam. NAVFAC anticipates a multi-billion dollar construction effort to occur over a period of approximately five to eight years.
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to continue obtaining information from various industries to assist in the planning and programming for this effort.  Industry input is being sought to guide NAVFAC in formulating acquisition and construction concepts, policies, standards and processes which will lead to procurement plans that deliver the required infrastructure in the most efficient and effective manner.
Planning for this effort is ongoing and no final decisions have been made with regard to the requirements, site, or acquisition strategy. Due to the potential magnitude of and location of this effort, there may be many unique challenges associated with completing the work.
In order to better anticipate such challenges and ensure that all options for addressing them are considered, NAVFAC is sponsoring a third industry forum on Guam from April 28 - 30, 2009.  The industry forum will include presentations by the various agency personnel involved in the acquisition planning, discussion of input received in response this RFI, and opportunities for industry to meet with Government officials and to provide input. 
Registration information and location details will be posted on the Guam Industry Forum Website at www.guamindustryforum.com prior to March 1, 2009 along with the proposed Industry Forum III agenda.  Please ensure that you regularly monitor the above website for registration details and other updates.  
We are targeting the Guam Industry Forum III towards general contractors, specialty subcontractors, designers and those who will support the upcoming design-build and design-bid-build projects for the Guam relocation. Support includes suppliers and service providers from materials to medical care. 
Topics currently considered for discussion include:  information technology, acquisition strategy, Workforce Logistics contract terms and evaluation factors, standardized components, Special Purpose Entities (Utilities), small business strategies, and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED).
To ensure a most effective Guam Industry Forum III that provides the information most useful to you, we are asking for your input as to the topics that are proposed to be covered. 
1.  What topics are of the greatest interest to you?
2.  What level of detail would you find most useful for the above topics?
3.  What are some of the questions you would like answered at this Forum?
4.  What improvements would you suggest based on the last two forums?
5.  What other suggestions do you have that would make the Guam Industry Forum III a more useful and interesting event for you?
Please submit your written responses to the above questions via email to the Guam Industry Forum Help Desk at helpdesk@guamindustryforum.com by 2:00 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time, on March 13, 2009.  Please limit your suggestions and responses to no more than two pages utilizing Microsoft Word format. At this Forum, we will do our best to address your interests. It is our goal to work with industry through these Forums to exchange ideas and information that will ensure the most efficient and effective relocation program possible. 
This is not a request for proposals and no solicitation will be issued at this time. All information submitted is at the offeror's own expense. No basis for claim against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information Notice.
Please do not submit proprietary materials or information you do not wish shared with the general audience at the industry forum.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), Microbial Food Safety (MFS), intends to negotiate solely with Risk Sciences International in Ottawa, Canada to make modifications to three components of the Predictive Microbiology Informaiton Portal.  There are three main components to the PMIP:  the Resource Locator, the Pathogen Modeling Program, and the ComBase Internet Browser.   Resource Locator:  The Resource Locator is a database of resources such as websites, documents, models and data sources which are searchable by defined categories. ERRC would like to expand the content of the Resource Locator to include resources related to E. coli O157:H7 in ground beef and C. perfringens in cooling of cooked products.  The list of resources to be added will be mutually developed by ERRC and RSI and ERRC will approve each resource to be added.  These resources will be added using the existing web-based administrator interface for the Resource Locator database.  Pathogen Modeling Program:  The Pathogen Modeling Program is an online version of the Pathogen Modeling Program desktop application. ERRC would like to add ten models to the online version of the Pathogen Modeling program. These models will be a combination of newly published models as well as models currently in the desktop version but not yet in the online version.  ERRC will provide all model documentation as well as the current PMP Online source code.  The models will be developing using Analytica and integrated with the online website by extending the existing Visual Studio source code.  The new models will then be installed on the server in Wyndmoor.  ComBase Internet Browser:  ComBase is a relational database of Predictive Microbiology information. ComBase contains thousands of data sets that describe the growth, survival and inactivation of bacteria under diverse environments relevant to food processing operations.  Access to this data is provided by the ComBase Internet browser. The browser is currently hosted on a server in Wyndmoor and mirrored on a server in Norwich.  Companies with the demonstrated capabilities of providing this instrument must submit a descriptive statement, including descriptive literature, specifically addressing the equipment’s components and availability.  The NAICS is 541511.  The statement and literature must be submitted to the Contracting Office Address within 5 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE

	All cleared personnel accessing information within FBI controlled space are required to execute FBI Form FD 1001 Consent for Warrant less Searches of Department of Justice (DOJ) Workplaces as a condition of working at FBI facilities.  The Director, FBI, implemented the Attorney General's policy subjecting employees to warrant less physical searches of their offices or immediate workplaces within DOJ premises when authorized by the Attorney General (AG) or the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) based upon a determination that:

	1) information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee is, or may be, disclosing classified information in an unauthorized manner;

	2) information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has incurred excessive indebtedness or has acquired a level of affluence that can not be reasonably explained by other information;

	3) information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee had the capability and opportunity to disclose classified information that is believed to have been lost or compromised to a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power; or

	4) information the Department deems credible indicates that the employee has repeatedly or significantly mishandled or improperly stored classified information.

The search may extend to the entire office or workplace and anything within it that might hold classified information, including locked containers (such as briefcases) and electronic storage media (such as computer disk and handheld computers), whether owned by the government, by the employee, or by a third party.  The search may be conducted by appropriate FBI personnel and/or law enforcement officers, on an announced or unannounced basis, during the workday or after hours.  If discovered during a search, evidence of misconduct - whether related to storage or classified information, storage of sensitive but unclassified information, or a crime - will be collected and reported to appropriate authorities.

	All forms will be retained by the FBI during the period the individual is providing services and two years after that individual's departure before final disposition is taken.

CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

1.	CERTIFIED GUNSMITH

	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous (Best Value) to the Government price and other factors considered.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  However, as the Technical merit becomes equal, price will be the determining factor.  The evaluation of this RFQ will be in accordance with Part 12 and Part 15 of the FAR.

You are advised to closely read the evaluation criteria set forth in this section prior to preparation of a technical proposal.  If any documentation requested in this solicitation is not provided or is incomplete, the offeror will be disqualified from further participation in the procurement.

				Technical Evaluation
				Past Performance
				Cost/Price

		In addition, the sub-factors and criteria listed under each Evaluation Factor are also in descending of importance, unless stated otherwise.  The offeror’s proposal will be evaluated as follows:

		The Source Evaluation Panel (SEP) will use a pass/fail & quantitative rating system for the Technical and Past Performance evaluation process.  The color-coded rating system is identified below.

		EVALUATION	STANDARD

		Blue			Exceeded the requirements of the RFQ.  Consistently high quality performance can be expected.
		Green			Meets the requirements of the RFQ.  High quality performance is likely but not assured due to minor omissions or areas where an unevenness might impact performance.
		Brown		Meets the requirements of the RFQ.  Satisfactory performance is like, but not assured due to omissions, defects, or deficiencies.
		Orange		Meets the requirements of the RFQ.  Moderate deficiencies exists which reflect the potential for poor, marginal effective performance.
		Red 			Does not meet the requirements of the RFQ.  Serious deficiencies exist in significant areas.  Performance demonstrates inability to provide satisfactory service.

&#61482;	United States citizen;
&#61482;	Capable of being awarded a TOP SECRET security clearance by the Federal Government.  (Reference the Security Section within Clause 52.212-4, Addendum.);
&#61482;	Demonstrate substantial knowledge of firearms repair and maintenance procedures for weapons identified in Section 1, Introduction;
&#61482;	Demonstrate ability of analyzing weapons in a non-working function;
&#61482;	Certification as a gunsmith or armorer;

&#61482;	Ability to prepare reports and other documents using computer software including Corel WordPerfect and Microsoft Office.

	Sub-Factor #3 – Question and Answer Interview

		 Once an offeror is determined to be within the set competitive Range, the offeror must demonstrate their knowledge of firearms and firearms repair by responding to a series of standardized questions pertaining to the operation and repair of FBI weapon systems, including Glock pistols, Remington Model 870 shotguns, SIG Sauer pistols, Colt 1911 pattern pistols, and Colt pattern carbines.
		
	Sub-Factor #4 – Field Stripping Test

Offerors will be required to disassemble and assemble common FBI service weapons, including the Glock 22 pistol, the Remington Model 870 shotgun, the Heckler & Koch MP5/10 submachine gun, and the Colt pattern carbine.  Correct techniques and safe weapon handling skills are required.  Offerors will be provided an initial briefing which describes the level to which each weapon is to be disassembled, and the time frame in which the task is to be completed.

	Sub-Factor #5 – Weapon Failure Analysis

Offerors will be presented with a Glock 22 pistol, a Remington Model 870 shotgun, and a Colt pattern carbine, with known problems.  Each offeror will be given the same basic information about the failure, as written on a repair tag.  The offeror will be required to identify the problem, through examining and disassembling the weapon.


EVALUATION FACTOR #2 - PAST PERFORMANCE:

The assessment for Past Performance shall be based on the following levels:

	Neutral:  No relevant past performance for evaluation.  The offeror has asserted it has no relevant experience directly related to the work to be done under this solicitation.  The offeror receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

	Satisfactory:  The offeror’s experience/past performance on recent projects of the nature, size, and scope of the FBI requirement is sufficient to support the requirements of the statement of work and initial tasks.  The experience/past performance information presented indicates the offeror will be capable of fulfilling the requirements of the SOW and initial task.

	Marginal:  The offeror’s experience/past performance is extremely weak and shows little evidence that the contractor could perform on this proposed contract.  The offeror may not have any experience or evidence of past performance.  The proposal reflects a lack of understanding of the requirements and embodies unacceptable risks.

EVALUATION FACTOR #3 - COST/PRICE:

The price submitted by each offeror will be evaluated to determine the best value for the Government.  The evaluated price shall be the cumulative total of the prices for the estimated quantities, base year and all option periods.  The price evaluation will determine whether each Offeror’s proposed prices are realistic, complete, and reasonable.

UNREALISTIC PROPOSALS

	Offeror’s are placed on notice that any proposals which are unrealistic in terms of technical commitment or are unreasonably low or high in price may be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of failure to comprehend the complexity and risk of the contract requirements and may be grounds for the rejection of the proposal.

4.	OPTIONS

The Government will evaluate offerors for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options.

5.	AWARD

A written notice of award of acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Adoption and application of new technology in railroad services is a key focus in the FRA Research and Development program.  One particular area of new development to help achieving this goal is in the advanced train control system and dispatching system, such as the new concept of Positive Train Control (PTC), which uses microprocessors, advanced navigation and tracking systems, and wireless technology to interconnect the various segments of railroad operation to virtually eliminate train to train collision and over-speed derailments, as well as to provide roadway worker protection.  This is an unrestricted solicitation for demonstrations of various technology advancements or techniques, specifically related to the following areas:  
(1)	Grade crossing hazard mitigation systems; 
(2)	Positive train control;
(3)	Wireless communication system;
(4)	Train tracking system;
(5)	Risk assessment & hazardous analysis; and
(6)	PTC/Communication enabling projects.
Technologies most likely to help facilitate the improvement of railroad services are those which will (1) improve safety by reducing human and technology failures; (2) bring about capital cost reductions and economy in producing equipment and facilities; (3) reduce operating costs of rail service by providing more efficient operations; (4) improve the reliability of equipment and infrastructure components by reducing failures and/or reducing false failure detections; (5) enhance the revenue-generating capability of high-speed operations by attracting greater ridership by reducing trip times, upgrading customer service quality, increasing reliability, or improving on time performance; and/or (6) enhance the social benefits and/or environmental aspects of high-speed rail.  
 Interested parties may submit proposals in accordance with the BAA-2009-1 package which may be downloaded or printed from the following Internet website: http://www.fra.dot.gov.  Follow the selections of “Research and Development” (from upper left home page menu), “Funds for Research”, and then “Broad Agency Announcement.”  BAA-2009-1 is not available in paper copy.

<DESC>It is the intent of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Targets and Countermeasures Program Office, 5222 Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898, to negotiate on a sole source basis with Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC), 3380 S. Price Road Chandler, AZ 85248.  The proposed acquisition is directed to Orbital Sciences Corporation pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302.1, “only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.”  The proposed acquisition will require the contractor to provide a maximum quantity of one (1) Medium Range Target (MRT) for the FTM-16E2 mission in support of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program.  The Government contemplates procuring the MRT by adding a new Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to an existing MDA Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract (HQ0147-08-C-0003) which contains other MRTs. The FTM-16E2 will include related target vehicle integration activities and Mission/Launch Support and Execution to be conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF).  The performance and technical requirements for this procurement are detailed under the Acquisition Technical Requirements (ATR) document of October 2008 and the MRT Technical Requirements Document (TRD) of August 2003.  The MRT will be comprised of a Quick Reaction Launch Vehicle-2 (QRLV-2) which meets the critical ATR requirements in it’s “as built” configuration and a Castor IVB Booster with the necessary range safety options and flight termination systems required by PMRF along with data collection instrumentation, countermeasures and other mission requirements consistent with other Aegis BMD Program missions.  The QRLV-2 contains many OSC proprietary items.  Delivery of the FTM-16E2 integrated target vehicle must be provided in time to support a Best Estimate Test Date (BETD) of 60 days from 1 August – 30 September 2010. Orbital has all the necessary design, engineering, manufacturing, software, integration, and mission execution expertise.  No other contractor fabricates the necessary configuration and integrates this vehicle or an equivalent medium range vehicle that satisfies the consistency requirement against FTM-16E2 within budget and schedule constraints.  See Note 22.

Delivery is required within 45 days after notice of award.   The provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors—Commercial, applies to this acquisition (there are no addenda to this provision).  

QUALIFICATION OF OFFERORS:  (1) proposals will be considered only from offerors who are regularly established in the business called for, including appraisals in conformance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and who are licensed to provide this service.  Successful offeror(s) shall meet any and all requirements of Federal, State, and City codes regarding operations of this type of service and compliance with USPAP; (2) the offeror must show evidence of his/her reliability, ability, and experience; (3) past performance information is an indicator of an offeror’s ability to perform the contract as required; and (4) the offeror must ensure the capacity to complete the services in the time specified by the contract.  The Government will evaluate quotes submitted in response to this RFQ, which meet the requirements in accordance with the factors listed below.  Failure to provide the minimal information needed for each factor may render a quote as non-responsive.  This section is intended to explain the rationale and minimum criteria by which quotes will be evaluated by the Government.  Offerors shall prepare quotes with these criteria in mind, both in terms of content and organization, in order to assist the Contracting Officer in determining the relative merit of quotes.  Offerors are advised that they are not restricted in what is presented in their quote as long as sufficient materials are provided to allow evaluation of specific elements of quotes as defined by the evaluation factors.  

The Government will award a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1 – Technical Competence/Experience:  This factor will examine the firm’s competence and experience in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisals and/or market analyses of agricultural lands.  Must provide copy of current State Real Property General Appraiser license.  Must be a licensed and registered real estate professional in the State of Washington.  Failure to provide a copy of a current license may render proposal as non-responsive.  This evaluation factor is equal in importance to Factor 2.

Factor 2 – Price:  This factor will evaluate the Government’s ability to acquire the desired deliverables at the best value to the Government.  This evaluation factor is equal in importance to Factor 1.

Factor 3 – Capacity to Accomplish the Work in a Required Time:  This factor will examine the offeror’s ability to complete services awarded within the specified performance period.  This evaluation factor is less important than Factors 1 and 2, but more important than Factors 4 and 5.

Factor 4 – Past Performance:  This factor will examine and evaluate offeror’s previous contracts.  Companies should be listed from current work up to the last three years.  Evaluations will be based on quality of service, timeliness, and customer satisfaction.  This evaluation factor is less important than Factors 1, 2, and 3, but more important than Factor 5.

Factor 5 - Educational Background:  This factor will look for specific educational courses relative to the real estate and appraisal profession (i.e. USPSP, eminent domain, or conservation easements).  This factor holds the least importance.

Offeror shall provide the above information for all proposed subcontractors who may be utilized to perform services under this contract.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offeror’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

In addition to other factors, quotes will be evaluated on the basis of advantages and disadvantages to the Government that might result from making more than one award (multiple awards).  It is assumed that for the purpose of evaluating quotes, that $500 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administering each contract awarded under this solicitation and individual awards will be for the items or combination of items that result in the best value to the Government, including the assumed administrative cost.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment 5 is to answer questions. The deadline for submission of proposals remains as 5 PM on Monday February 9.
<p>Question: Will the customer consider a sprayed on elastomeric monolithic lining as an acceptable alternative to repairing the failing liner? Pool liners fail; this alternative is significantly more robust and will not fail.<br />Answer: Secret Service will consider it provided the following information is given by the vendor: Pool they have applied it to that has an aluminum substrate, contact name and number at that pool, how long has it been installed, the length of the warranty for this material and how can the coating be repaired when damaged. Note that for any proposal received, all of the required elements stated must be discussed; see the entire solicitation.</p>
<p>Question: Also, on the recessed stairs could you tell me if the liner is on top of the stairs, i.e. each step has liner on them or if the stairs are composite or fiberglass that the liner only is attached around the outside edge? <br />Answer: The recessed steps are part of the Training Tank aluminum wall. They are totally covered with liner</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to republish the original announcement pursuant to FAR 35.016(c). This republishing also includes the following change: (a) Changes the contracting POC from Lori Smith to Lynn White. Previous modifications are incorporated into this republishing. No other changes have been made.
<p>DATES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 06 should be submitted by 1 Aug 05; FY 07 by 1 Aug 06; FY 08 by 1 Aug 07; FY 09 by 1 Aug 08, and FY 10 by 1 Aug 09. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 31 Jan 10, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME. See Section IV of this announcement for further details.</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Motion imagery and conventional imagery both provide visual data sources for intelligence gathering purposes through the use of various exploitation technologies and methodologies that demand high performance and dynamic operations to meet mission tasking and exploitation timelines. Data formats, sensor type and spectral characteristics are the determining factors that dictate the exploitation technologies that will be required to process the data and extract the information to obtain the mission objectives. The streaming video data format require different strategies for processing motion imagery over conventional two dimensional imaging sensors, but these sensors also differ with some being active or passive and spectral range of operation that require other processing and exploitation considerations. Although motion imagery and conventional imagery have differing requirements with respect to the implementation of the processing strategies, the types of processing strategies can be very similar. These imagery collection systems and the resultant data are exploited by teams of analysts, operational and warfighter personnel. Exploitation often includes object or target detection, material identification and producing a report. The goal of this research and development activity is to produce better tools and procedures to support exploitation operations in deriving more accurate and timely information from motion imagery and conventional imagery sources. Specific areas include:</p>
<p>Ability to ingest, visualize, process, exploit and output imagery products in standard and planned data formats for motion imagery and conventional imagery sources. These formats shall include evolving new data structure and compression schema standards.</p>
<p>Improved procedures for performing graphics annotation to create embedded non-destructive graphic, symbology and textual layers to accompany motion imagery or conventional image data files in standardized formats.</p>
<p>Object tracking paradigms that provide technologies for continuous real time object tracking of both stationary and moving targets of opportunity. These technologies shall address the conditions where the target is temporarily obscured by intervening objects or shadows and then reappears. Tracking shall be accomplished through graphic, text and symbolic overlays and shall also calculate speed and direction parameters for the target.</p>
<p>Enhanced algorithms to perform feature extraction and image segmentation. These algorithms are required to provide enclosed line segment boundaries outlining targets and objects of interest in order to compute statistics for characterizing the feature's shape, size, material content and other identifying information for pattern recognition purposes and to support object tracking paradigms.</p>
<p>Optimized techniques for analysts to produce coherent change detection and two color multi-view products from synthetic aperture radar sources.</p>
<p>Refined spectral analysis capabilities to perform anomaly detection, surface material identification, atmospheric correction and the use of common signature libraries for multispectral and hyperspectral sensors.</p>
<p>Two-dimensional/three-dimensional visualization capabilities to support the presentation of multiple intelligence data sources, including motion imagery (e.g., visible, IR, etc.), imagery, maps, elevation data, text, graphics and symbology, in a common geospatial reference for exploitation purposes.</p>
<p>Effective methodologies for deriving accurate geo-positioning information and performing precise mensuration in which operations span the use of diverse data sets and evolving concepts such as smart images.</p>
<p>Software design and development strategies that follow accepted standards and provide intuitive motion imagery and conventional imagery exploitation tools for the analyst and implement and support Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) oriented scenario concepts such as publish and subscribe mechanisms.</p>

The Guard Tower itself is manufactured with four separate wall units that allow for quick and easy assembly on top of the standard Conex Box. Once placed on the Conex Box the Guard Tower will be approximately 12 feet in the air, giving the guards a greater view of the perimeter or area of threat. Once in position, the walls are filled from the top using sand as ballast.

The overhead cover is 3/4m plywood on which lights, sensors, and antennae can be installed if desired. Access to the cover can be reached through a hatch type door that is pre-installed for convenience. The CBP Guard Tower eliminates the time and the mess associated with using sandbags. This product is a recoverable asset that can be broken down and deployed inside the Conex Box.

The Portable Guard Tower is a complete unit which includes one Guard Tower, one Conex Box, one pallet (75 coils or 3750 ft) of 18" Helix Coil, and a Wire Installation Kit. The Wire Installation Kit includes a Fence Driver, 25 5-foot stakes, and 25 7-foot stakes.  
The Guard Tower itself is manufactured with four separate wall units that allow for quick and easy assembly on top of the standard Conex Box. Once placed on the Conex Box the Guard Tower will be approximately 12 feet in the air, giving the guards a greater view of the perimeter or area of threat. Once in position, the walls are filled from the top using sand as ballast. The sand filled walls provide the guards inside with 360 degrees of protection from 9mm, 5.56, and 7.62 threats. 12 dumps are provided for easy removal of the ballast allowing the Guard Tower to be repositioned as needed. 
The overhead cover is 3/4m plywood on which lights, sensors, and antennae can be installed if desired. Access to the cover can be reached through a hatch type door that is pre-installed for convenience. The Guard Tower eliminates the time and the mess associated with using sandbags. This product is a recoverable asset that can be broken down and deployed inside the Conex Box.
All parts and tools needed for assembly are included in the kit bag. Stakes are also provided for the Concertina Wire installation.

********************************************************************************************

The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ intends to procure a Multi-Function Display (MFD) System in support of PMS 500?s DDG 1000 Program.  The tasks cover design, fabrication, testing and delivery of the production representative model, as well as support for integration, installation and checkout.  Upon successful completion of developmental test, integration test and first article test the Government may exercise contract options for production and fielding of seven systems and spares.  A competitive 100% Small Business Set Aside is anticipated.
The MFD program objective is the acquisition and initial support of an integrated display that will provide three different visual cues for day and night helicopter operations on DDG 1000 class ships.  The visual cues integrated into the MFD include the flight deck status display, a horizon reference display and an Aircraft-Ship Integrated Secure and Traverse (ASIST) System position display.  The MFD will communicate with the Total Ship Computing Environment Infrastructure (TSCEI) Network through redundant Distributed Adaptation Processors (DAPs) to receive ship?s roll stabilization signals from NAVDDX and to update settings such as deck status and lighting intensity to accommodate a variety of meteorological and lighting conditions for flight operations.  The system will be controlled by command signals from a remote operator.  The operator interface will be a Common Electronic Display (CED) provided by the ship builder and located in the Helicopter Control Station (HCS).  Commands will be received by the MFD via the TSCEI and DAPs.  Emergency operation and maintenance capability will be provided via a hard-wired maintenance control panel provided as part of the system.  The MFD program will involve designing, building and testing a production representative system in order to achieve the objectives set forth in the DDG 1000 Operational Requirements Document (ORD) and to demonstrate conformance to the MFD System Specification with the option to purchase production systems.  The MFD contract is a portion of the next generation suite of Visual Landing Aids which will be incorporated into the DDG 1000.
A Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued to the companies that respond to the FedBizOpps synopsis, as well as those companies on the solicitation mailing list.  Because the specifications and drawings are subject to Export Control Laws, the companies are required to register with the United States/Canada Joint Certification Office through the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), and provide a copy of their executed DD Form 2345 to the contracting office before a copy of the solicitation package is mailed.  It is mandatory to register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  The CCR provides the DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System + 4 number) number and a company?s CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code that will be required to conduct business with the Department of Defense.
Award will be based on a determination of ?Best Value?, which may require discussions with the offerors. The evaluation factors will be Technical, Experience, Past Performance, and Price.  Copies of DD Form 2345 and request for copies of the solicitation shall be forwarded to Mr. David Andreoli, 732-323-5208, david.andreoli@navy.mil, fax # 732-323-7440.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify potential qualified offerors. If a solicitation is issued it may or may not be restricted to 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) and Small Business (SB).
The Mobile Utilities Support Equipment (MUSE) Division of the The Naval Facilities Expeditionary Logistics Center (NFELC) will use the responses to this sources sought synopsis to make appropriate acquisition decisions for the planned contract.  This Sources Sought announcement is a Market Survey for written information.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  After review of the responses submitted regarding this potential acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) and in the Federal Business Opportunities FEDBIZOPPS) websites, if the Government intends to continue with the procurement.
The MUSE Division provides medium, 5 kV, and low, 480 V, voltage transportable prime power diesel power plants (generators) for use by Department of Defense worldwide.  MUSE maintains a ready fleet of non tactical high (1800 RPM) and medium speed (720-900 RPM) transportable diesel generators 200 to 2500 kW.  The equipment consists of 2 stroke(Electro Motive Diesel, EMD) and 4 stroke(Cummins, Caterpillar) diesel engines, internal and external exhaust silencers, self and separately excited synchronous single bearing generators, analog and digital automatic voltage regulators, analog and digital governors, integral and separate ancillary systems (fuel, oil, coolant), metal enclosed and metal clad utility parallel generator control switchgear, motor control centers, ISO container and drop over aluminum and steel enclosures, structural steel sub-bases (drag skids), utility grade protective relaying, EPA Tier I and II certified engines, OEM and aftermarket analog and digital gener! ator controls and other components to comprise a fully self contained black start capable prime, continuous, or standby power plant.
The general Scope of Work is for the services and products necessary to accomplish equipment repair, or overhaul, or remanufacture or modernization, to include project management and quality control, of MUSE power plants.  Each piece of MUSE may require different levels of work to be determined on a case by case basis.  MUSE equipment is built to industry consensus standards such as the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), International association of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Standards Organization (ISO), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Society for Protective Coatings (SSPC), and International Electrical Testing Association (NETA). Any and all work shall be performed by the contractor to these and other applicable standards.  This equipment is neither MILSPEC nor the typical portable standby generator found commercially.  It is robust, transportable, continuous duty equipment ! designed to serve in lieu of the commercial utility, often in remote locations and harsh environments. The contractor shall not be required to work outside the contiguous United States.
The Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), or maintenance manuals, for MUSE equipment is atypical as well. Contractors are encouraged to review "Unified Facilities Guide Specification UFGS-01 78 23" (July 2006) for amplifying information, as this is the specification section that will be used as a guide should OMSI data be specified.  It is available on the web at:      "http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFGS/UFGS%2001%2078%2023.pdf"

It is anticipated that work will take place at the contractor's facility. If it is more cost effective to the Government work may take place at the Governments facility. Location of work will be at the sole discretion of the contracting officer.
Respondents should also reply with information regarding their preferred contract type for this requirement. Respondents should also submit whether they prefer to repair, overhaul or modernize only high speed (1800 RPM) or only medium speed (720-900 RPM) power plants.

<DESC>The U. S. Government currently occupies 1,856 rentable square feet of office and related use space located at 1126 Jackson Ave, Pascagoula, MS, under a soon to expire lease. The General Services Administration (GSA) plans to negotiate a succeeding lease at the current location for the same square footage, based on economic, mission, and other related factors. The Government will develop a cost benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location.  In making that determination the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications and non-productive agency down time.

This contract may be used to support the National Levee Inspection Program.  Subject to program requirements, the Government intends to negotiate and award two indefinite delivery contracts within one year after the required response date to this announcement, but reserves the right to award up to two additional indefinite delivery contracts (a maximum total of four contracts).

Each contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four option periods not to exceed one year each.  The amount of work in each contract period will not exceed $1,200,000 ($6,000,000 total per contract).  However, an option period may be exercised at the Governments sole discretion when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  Furthermore, any unused capacity may be rolled over to the next contract period at the Governments sole discretion.  Yearly rate schedules with annual cost escalation will be negotiated for the contracts.  On each individual contract, the first years rate schedule shall become effective the day of contract award, and shall be in effect for 1 year from contract award.  Subsequent rate schedules shall become effective on the yearly anniversary dates from contract award.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed-price task orders, not to exceed the contract amount.

This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6 and supplements thereto.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications to accomplish the required work.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  All interested A-E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent consistent with the efficient performance of the contract with small and small disadvantaged firms.  If a large business is selected, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract.  The subcontracting goals for this contract, which are subject to change, currently are that a minimum of 70.0 percent of the contractor's intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses (SB), including 6.2 percent with small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), 7.0 percent be placed with woman-owned businesses, 9.8 percent with HUB Zone Small Businesses, 3.0% with Veteran-Owned Small Business and 0.9 percent with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  A subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal.  North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4,500,000 in annual average receipts.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act, relative to the employees home office location.  Prior to contract award, a firm must be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>THIS PROCUREMENT IS BEING ISSUED UNDER THE SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR SUBPART 19.10 AND WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The target ceiling for contract award for design and construction is $14,500,000.00. The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award. Offerors are under no obligation to approach this amount. This project is for the Design and Construction of a Hazardous Material Response Facility consisting of a laboratory, conference and general use space for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency at the Pentagon Reservation in Arlington, Virginia. 

The Design-Build process will have two distinct phases. Phase-I will be the pre-qualification process, where the Government will select 3 to 5 Design-Build Contractors on the basis of Project Organization and Personnel, Offeror's Experience and Resource Commitment, Management Control Systems, Past Performance, Management/Technical Compliance Certification, and Financial Capacity. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Project Organization and Personnel being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important.

Only the selected Design-Build Contractors will then qualify for the Phase-II of the process. In Phase-II of the procurement procedure, offerors will be given the opportunity to offer their preliminary design and cost proposals. Final selection and basis for award of the design-build contract will be on the basis of Qualifications, Technical Quality, Price, and Other Salient Factors considered being in the Government's best interests. The elements are listed in descending order of importance with Qualifications being the most important and the remaining elements becoming increasingly less important. This is not a low bid award project. If awarded the contract, the offeror shall complete the design and construction documents and construct the facility in compliance with these completed requirements. The building could be two stories and shall be sited to increase visibility and impact from the initial approach to the building. The Design/Build Contractor shall design the new building shall complement other structures in the area around the building. However, design and construction creativity and innovation is encouraged. 

Plans and Specifications will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Web Page at http://www.fbo.gov/. Offerors may register on the Interested Vendors List (IVL) at http://www.fbo.gov/ and retrieve an IVL from the same location. All technical inquiries and questions relating to this solicitation are to be submitted via e-mail to JoAnn Avants at joann.avants@whs.mil and Gregory Lindsey at gregory.lindsey.ctr@whs.mil. Compact disc and hardcopies will not be available. Offerors should check often for changes (Amendments). 

This notice only constitutes a request for Phase-I proposals and no information required by the Phase-II proposals are to be submitted.  All Phase-I proposals shall be delivered to 1777 N. Kent St., Arlington, VA 22209 no later than the offer due date/time indicated on the SF1442.

<AWARDEE>The Boeing Company, 499 Boeing Blvd., Huntsville, AL 35824-3001 US
<DESC>The Boeing Company, Integrated Defense Systems (Global Services and Support Division), St. Louis, Missouri, is being awarded $249, 937,154  for a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for operations and sustainment support for the fielded portions of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) System for calendar year (CY) 2009 with an option for CY 2010.  The principal places of performance are the contractor’s facility in Huntsville, Alabama and Missile Defense Agency facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, and Fort Greely, Alaska.  This sole source contract is awarded pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Specifically, as provided in the Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition, Boeing, as the incumbent prime contractor for the operations and sustainment of the GMD Weapon System, is the only qualified source to perform this effort without unacceptable delay to critical program schedules and unaffordable duplication of costs.  The MDA, Huntsville, Alabama, is the contracting activity (HQ0147-09-C-0007).  The period of performance is from January 2009 through December 2009 with a one year option to continue work from January 2010 through December 2010.  The contract will be incrementally funded for $133,429,130 at award.  Fiscal year (FY) 09 Research, Development, Test and Evaluation funds (RDT&E) will be used for the primary operations and sustainment support activities.  FY09 Army Operation and Maintenance (O&M) funds will be used for training of Army soldier-operators.  The RDT&E funds will not expire at the end of the fiscal year.  The O&M funds will expire at the end of the fiscal year.  This award is an interim measure which will continue essential O&S support to the GMD system in the near-term while MDA acquires and verifies necessary technical data and develops its strategy for competitive acquisition of follow-on GMD O&S support.  On February 4, 2009, MDA published a formal announcement of its intent relative to follow-on GMD O&S efforts subsequent to effort covered by this current award. The purpose of the February 4, 2009 FEDBIZOPPS announcement is to initiate immediate dialogue with industry regarding a competitive acquisition strategy for follow-on GMD O&S support requirements, with a stated intent to make a competitive award for such requirements no later than calendar year 2011.

<DESC>Toward Maximizing the Scientific Value of the Biologic Specimens from the Women's Health Initiative II

The NIH has supported collection of blood samples and clinical data from participants in the three clinical trials and the observational study of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) since 1993. This well-characterized population provides a rare and valuable scientific resource maintained under contracts between NHLBI and the WHI centers. Promoting optimal use on a national scale of such a resource requires a large and concerted effort which may exceed the research capacities of individual study locations, and of WHI as a whole. The NHLBI and the researchers it supports have a responsibility to the public in general, and the scientific community in particular, to encourage the most rapid scientific progress possible using these resources. In order to take full advantage of such resources and to maximize their research value, it is important that samples and data collected with public funds be made available, with the least amount of restrictions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.

The NHLBI and NIH programs were reviewed to determine whether existing projects will satisfy the requirement, and the proposed activity was discussed with key staff in NHLBI and other NIH Institutes to determine that this BAA does not replicate other efforts. The WHI resource is unique in its scope, focus on diseases of older women, ethic and racial diversity, and in particular in that it includes several large randomized controlled clinical trials which are capable of yielding information that cannot be obtained from observational studies. Care will be taken to ensure that the investigations under this BAA will not duplicate those already performed by the WHI investigators and their colleagues.

The original WHI study population included 161,808 postmenopausal women in the United States, 68,132 (42%) of whom were randomized to one or more components of the clinical trial (CT), and 93,676 (58%) of whom were enrolled in the observational study (OS) between 1993 and 1998. Recruitment criteria included being 50-79 years of age, being post-menopausal, and planning to live in the area of a given Clinical Center (CC) for three years, with specific exclusionary criteria for the Dietary Modification (DM) and Hormone Therapy (HT) Trial components. Specific study goals were set for ethnic distribution (20% minority women in the CT) and age distribution (30% for 50-59 years of age; 45% for 60-69; 25% for 70-79). The original cohort was followed until March 31, 2005, after which subjects were invited to enroll in the WHI Extension Study from 2005 to 2010. As of August 2006 there were 115,273 women (77% of eligibles) enrolled in the Extension Study, during which ascertainment of outcomes (including activities of daily life) has continued together with limited exposure data on use of hormone therapy, calcium/vitamin D supplements, and 24-hour recall of food intake (in a subset).

This acquisition will employ a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals that will maximize the scientific yield from the biologic resource and associated participant exposure and outcome data in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), by soliciting the best ideas for laboratory-based research studies to apply to the WHI biologic resource. This second solicitation follows on a first solicitation issued in January, 2006. WHI collected extensive information on multiple outcomes, including any disease leading to overnight hospitalization, cancers, self-report of a number of additional conditions, measures of cognition/dementia, sleep, and functional status, amongst others. For this second BAA solicitation, proposals utilizing the data on any of the phenotypes or groups of phenotypes will be considered. It is anticipated that the research programs funded by this BAA will include applications of genomics, proteomics, and other laboratory investigations to the existing frozen samples of DNA, serum, plasma, red blood cells, and urine. The BAA will not fund new data collection and will make use of existing biologic specimens.

In general, the BAA seeks innovative technologies that enable comprehensive, yet efficient, investigation of sets of markers associated with disease outcomes or treatment effects, or of groups of mediators that might substantively explain the pathway of exposure or treatment effects on disease. For example, genomic studies might include whole-genome and haplotype approaches and studies of sets of functional genes with related effects on an outcome. Studies that combine information from genes and gene products in the form of blood proteins could help to elucidate pathways. Studies on serum or plasma might include multiplex assays of a panel of markers, for example adipokines or cytokines, which allow a large number of markers to be tested using a modest amount of sample. On the other hand, focused studies on a more limited number of candidate genes or candidate markers will be considered if there are reasonably strong data supporting large effects from these individual markers that need to be confirmed in a large dataset, and their validation has potential public health implications. 

Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) are used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed towards advancing the state-of-the art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific solution. Proposals received under this BAA will be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria as specified in the solicitation, through a peer review process. Proposals will not be evaluated against a specific Government need, as in the case of a conventional request for proposals (RFP), as they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.

The primary basis for selecting proposals submitted in response to this BAA shall be technical excellence, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. The technical evaluation of proposals will be conducted through a peer review process in accordance with established criteria. The evaluation criteria shall evaluate the Offeror's scientific and technical approach, adequacy of the technical approach, the Offeror's capabilities, and the qualifications, capabilities experience, and availability of proposed key personnel. NHLBI program and administrative staff will determine importance to agency programs and availability of funds. In addition, past performance of the Offeror and the extent of small disadvantaged business concerns in performance of the program will also be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.304.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712, Size Standard - 500 employees. It is anticipated that 10 to 14 cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded for 2-year periods beginning on or about December 15, 2008. The solicitation will be in the form of a Broad Agency Announcement, numbered BAA-NHLBI-WH-09-01 and will be available electronically on or about September 27, 2007 and may be accessed through the Internet at the following address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. under the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart Lung and Blood postings. Proposals will be due on or about January 29, 2008. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and for routinely checking the Internet site for any solicitation amendments that may be issued by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.
