If services are provided on a federally observed holiday, the HCW will not receive another day off and the contractor will invoice at the firm fixed price in Section B. 3.1.3. Services shall normally be provided on-site Monday through Friday between the hours of 0700 and 1700 and Sat, Sun and federally observed holidays holidays from 0730 - 1100 for a 9-hour period. Each shift will be extended 1 hour for an uncompensated meal break to cover a full 9 hours of service when the on-site services/shift is greater than 5 hours in duration. Remaining hours will be beeper/on-call watch. The physician will be expected to return to work within 30 minutes of receiving a page. Past experience has shown on an average the physician has had to return to the MTF to provide less than 10 hours per week. 3.1.4. Contractor employees may receive one compensated work break in the morning and one in the afternoon, workload permitting, at the discretion of the Government during a 9 hour work day. Neither break shall exceed 15 minutes and cannot be combined with lunch breaks. 3.1.5. On-call Rotation. As part of the HCW?s normal tour of duty, on-call rotation is assumed with other providers.

The contractor shall not perform these services until a modification has been issued by the Contracting Officer authorizing the contractor to provide these services. 3.2. Absences and Leave. 3.2.1. The contractor shall have sufficient qualified reserve personnel so that all services are provided in the event a HCW scheduled to work becomes ill, resigns, is terminated, or is otherwise unavailable to work.

Unless otherwise authorized by a defense appropriations bill, contractors shall not be reimbursed by the Government for services not rendered during a Government furlough. In the event of a Government furlough, the Commanding Officer will determine which contract employees are considered critical and therefore must report to work. Contract employees deemed critical shall be compensated for services rendered during a furlough. All other contract employees shall be furloughed until the Government shutdown ends or they are notified by the COR that they have become critical employees. 3.2.6. A HCW with a bona fide medical emergency occurring while on duty, or with an on-the-job injury, will be provided stabilizing medical care according to the procedures of the MTF. 3.2.7. In the instance where the Government directs the HCW to remain on duty in excess of their scheduled shift due to an unforeseen emergency or to complete patient treatment where lack of continuity of care would otherwise jeopardize patient health, the health care worker shall remain on duty. The health care worker will be given an equal amount of compensatory time during the 8 or 9 day tour of duty to be scheduled upon mutual agreement of the HCW and the Commanding Officer.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to Diagnosis One, Inc. 

In 2006, the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) was established in Pakistan.  The goals of the program include developing epidemiological surveillance systems that will be used by FELTP trainees in disease detection and outbreak response activities in Pakistan.  The contractor shall assist CDC to meet the needs of the FELTP by providing Information Technology for public health surveillance in Pakistan, and by providing the infrastructure to build, support, expand, and modify the public health surveillance system to facilitate international strategies in the fight against public health threats and emergencies.

The purpose of this contract is to continue the work initiated under an existing purchase order with Diagnosis One to do the following:  
(1)  Conduct a series of internal software testing of the alpha and beta versions of  the public health surveillance software and provide written modification requirements to Diagnosis One that will be incorporated into the software based on the current program activities of the FELTP, working in conjunction with the Pakistan Ministry of Health; 
(2) Initiate and determine the public health surveillance system requirements of the country; and 
(3) Define additional modification requirements for the development of the public health surveillance system in Pakistan, as part of training activities for the FELTP. This will result in capturing disease data at the local and national levels and the flow of the disease data from the local level to the national level. 

It is imperative to utilize Diagnosis One for this contract.  Diagnosis One?s D1.Extend software is proprietary and is the only software compatible with the existing systems within the Pakistan Ministry of Health.  CDC currently owns the licenses for the D1 surveillance software.  Further, Diagnosis One developed the surveillance software for phase one activities.  Selecting a new contractor will require purchasing new licenses and reconfiguring the software specifications, which would be cost prohibitive and significantly delay FELTP surveillance activities.  

The North American Industry Classification Code is 541511.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR 342) is soliciting pre-proposals and proposals in the following topic area within the Naval Warrior Applications program.  This program includes basic research and applied research components.

Undersea Medicine.  The field of Undersea Medicine covers a broad area of research topics in need of multidisciplinary approaches to understanding basic mechanisms and developing solutions.  Investigators in such research disciplines as molecular biology, immunology, biochemistry, physiology, stress physiology, environmental physiology, neuroscience, psychology, computational fluid dynamics, and others are invited and encouraged to bring their expertise to bear on the issues outlined below.  The goal of this effort is to encourage new thinking that will lead to the elucidation of the physiological and biochemical (molecular) mechanisms underlying the effects of stressors experienced by Navy and Marine Corps divers and Navy submarine personnel. Research proposals in the following areas are requested:

1) studies of the pathophysiology of decompression sickness (DCS) and arterial gas embolism (AGE), with an emphasis on characterizing a) cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors or signaling systems) interactions with nitrogen gas emboli, b) how these interactions influence DCS/AGE risk (including molecular and cellular pathology), c) methods to improve prediction and diagnosis of DCS/AGE using non-invasive imaging techniques and/or by use of specific cellular and molecular processes, d) improved therapeutic (non-recompressive) interventions to mitigate DCS and AGE, e) novel methods to remove excess gases from tissues and f) greater understanding of how exposure to thermal stress can influence DCS risk, f) mathematical modeling of fluid dynamics that may influence DCS incidence;

2) studies to elucidate the cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors or signaling systems) pathology of hyperbaric oxygen toxicity (HBO) to include:  a) determination of those specific perturbations of metabolic processes by hyperbaric oxygen that are demonstrably and causally related to HBO (using the tools of metabolomics, proteomics, and genomics, and leading to a functional understanding of these responses at the molecular and cellular level), b) molecular and cellular details of the pathology associated with HBO, c) studies to develop prophylactic therapeutics for HBO toxicity (e.g., central nervous system, pulmonary, and ocular pathology) and d) methods to detect in real time the development of oxidative injury in situ;

3) studies to elucidate the acute effects of heat and cold stress on performance as well as the physiologic adaptive mechanisms to heat and cold stress, including the mechanisms of these responses at the cellular (gene activation) and molecular (enzymes, receptors and signaling systems) level;

4) studies on the effects of high and low frequency sound on human divers at the organism, organ, cellular, and molecular levels;
            
5) studies on the identification and mitigation of operational stressors, including an understanding of these stressors at the molecular, cellular and pharmacologic level, experienced by submariners, including technologies to improve operator performance in submarines in the littoral battle space and to improve the survival of submariners during submarine rescue operations;

6) studies on the management of trauma in the undersea environment;

7) studies in the area of diving medicine such as fitness to dive, longitudinal medical effects, barotraumas and immersion stress;

8) studies of high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) at the organism, organ, cellular and molecular level.

In order to foster the development of young investigators in the field, up to two of the awards under this program may be Postdoctoral Awards (see  paragraph 7 -  Instrument Type(s) for details).  Pre-proposals and Proposals submitted designated as Postdoctoral will be evaluated (using the same criteria as Primary Awards) as a separate category.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:  The General Services Administration (GSA) is seeking expressions of interest from fee title property owners, or their duly authorized representatives, wishing to execute a no-cost assignable option to purchase land, or an assemblage of properties, for a lease construction project.  The expression of interest is for the SITE ONLY.  The Government-selected developer will exercise the option at the negotiated purchase price.

The site must be strategically located for the operational needs of a federal agency.  Zoning of adjacent properties and master planning of the general area should be compatible with the proposed project.  The property must have convenient access to major freeways but not be adjacent to overpasses, bridges, elevated ramps, or railroad tracks.  Sites should have adequate electrical power, sanitary sewer, water, telephone, cable TV and fiber optics available, or easily accessible.

Any property submitted for consideration must be relatively flat and consist of a minimum of seven to a maximum of ten contiguous buildable acres and must be located outside of any designated 100-year floodplain.  The property should not have any easements or rights-of-way encumbering the property that break up the buildable area; portions subject to an easement or right of way will not be counted in buildable area.  

LOCATION:  To warrant consideration, the property must lie within the following boundaries:

South:	Business Interstate 80

West:	Interstate 5, California State Highway 99

North:	Howsley Road/Sunset Blvd W., Fiddyment Road, Athens Ave, 
        Industrial Ave, Whitney Blvd

East:	California State Highway 65, Sunset Blvd, Pacific St, 
        Sierra College/Hazel Ave, Madison Ave, Auburn Blvd, Watt
        Ave, Arden Way, Business Interstate 80

A market survey will be conducted to inspect sites offered for consideration.  

Upon selection of the site and execution of the assignable no-cost purchase option, GSA will conduct a procurement and select a developer.  GSA will then assign the option to the future developer to purchase the optioned site and construct a facility for the U.S. Government consisting of an office building of approximately 170,343 Gross Square Feet and a separate parking facility to accommodate a minimum of 215 individual parking spaces under a leasehold interest for the U.S. Government.  

Brokers and/or agents may represent the site owner, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the ownership of the site.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST:  If you desire to submit a location for consideration, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, July 13, 2007.  Expressions of interest should include documentation of ownership and information about the current zoning of the property.  Owners are encouraged to provide the following information, if available: (1) Any entitlements or any applications for entitlements to the property; (2) Any existing environmental and geotechnical information; (3) A topographical map of the area; (4) A metes and bounds survey of the property being offered, and a land survey of the site and its environs; and, (5) A drawing that illustrates availability of public utilities (natural gas, water, sewer, and electric) from the property lines.  Owner should also indicate on the drawing the closest available connection point to fiber optics, as well as label all roads that provide access to the property.  Similarly, all county, state, and federally maintained roads within one-quarter (1/4) mile of the property should be reflected.  

This advertisement is NOT a basis for negotiations and the right is hereby reserved, as the interest of the Government may require it, to reject any or all offers and give consideration to sites other than those offered in response to this broadcast.  

Fee title owners, or their duly authorized representatives, are invited to submit expressions of interest, specifying address and legal description of the property, to:

<DESC>Child and Spouse Abuse, Sexual Assault, Discrimination and Sexual Harassment is a central registry for incident based reporting that supports the Family Advocacy Program (FAP), Equal Opportunity Advisors, and Headquarters Marine Corps.  This program also provides data to DoN and OSD. The following is a Request for Information (RFI). This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals. Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Marine Corps to form a binding contract. The Marine Corps purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas, and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of any future procurement for these services. The Marine Corps believes industry feedback is important, and is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative. Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. Comments are!   solicited regarding the following: Based on the needs of the Marine Corps, it has been determined that market research is needed to determine if sources exist capable of producing available solutions satisfying all requirements to the maximum extent practicable, or can be modified to meet all requirements to the maximum extent practicable.  Currently, Marine and Family Services reports and forms must be assembled and completed by hand. Staff must physically go to their file cabinet, search through paper files, and then tally the records of client contacts. Each month (or more frequently in data call situations), staff must manually compile the data, enter the totals on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, then email the file to Marine Corps Headquarters (HQ) or other interested parties. This is not only a cumbersome, manual process, but also circulates personal client information via email, creating vulnerability for unauthorized disclosure Replies are not mandatory. Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting request for proposals or quotations. The use of comments received from industry to complete final statements of work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the sole discretion of the Marine Corps. Eligibility in participating in future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this RFI. The Marine Corps will not critique a potential offerors comments and does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of the RFI. Proprietary information is not being solicited. Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such. Responses to this RFI must be submitted no later than 29 June 2007 by e-mail to edward.mcgrail@usmc.mil. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED. NO EXCEPTIONS

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) and Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC) intend to competitively procure the FY08 requirements for the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) of Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) craft. Two separate unrestricted solicitations, one issued by NAVSEA, the other issued by SWRMC, are planned for release in Fall 2007 leading to the award of two firm fixed price contracts.  This announcement only addresses the NAVSEA procurement. A separate announcement will be released to address the SWRMC procurement. NAVSEA will competitively procure SLEPs on three Assault Craft Unit Four (ACU-4) craft with an option  (FY09) for three additional craft. The RFP will be issued in mid October 2007 or later. The LCAC SLEP scope of effort includes repair and upgrade of the buoyancy box (structural hull), gas turbine engine replacement, installation of a new skirt (inflatable hull), installation of an integrated Command, Control, Communication, Comp!  uter and Navigation (C4N) equipment package, and accomplishment of selected craft alterations and repair work. The gas turbine engines will be furnished by the Government. The SLEP effort is to be performed in accordance with Government prepared specifications, drawings, work item descriptions, and craft alteration records. The specification package has been changed from previous LCAC SLEP procurements competitions in order to facilitate offerors reviewing and understanding the scope of required effort. Offers will be accepted nationwide; however, work is to be performed at the Assault Craft Unit (ACU-4), Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base, Norfolk VA. Offerors are not restricted to Master Ship Repair Agreement (MSRA) or Agreement for Boat Repair (ABR) holders. Management  and price proposals will be required. In preparation for the intended release of the solicitation, an LCAC SLEP Industry Day is being planned at ACU 4 on 10 July 2007.      This Industry Day will include !  a tour of the ACU LCAC maintenance facilities and viewing of select LC AC. Responses of interest in this announcement are to be provided via e-mail to Mr. John Kimener at the following address: john.kimener@navy.mil with copy to kharrin2@csc.com.  The e-mail subject line must be titled "FY08 LCAC SLEP."   It is requested that responses be limited to one per company.  Responses shall include company name, primary point of contact with full contact information (i.e., mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address), and a list of individuals who may attend Industry Day.  Respondents will receive information concerning Industry Day as well as additional background information that will better define the scope of effort.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) intends to issue a Purchase Order for fabrication of a portable pallet assembly for mounting a gas turbine engine and transmission, in accordance with Government-owned drawings and specifications.  This procurement will be conducted as a competitive 100% small business set-aside under the authority of FAR Part 13.  The NAICS code is 332312, Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing.  Award will be based on meeting Technical requirements, Delivery, Price, and Past Performance, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The fabrication specifications are as follows:  The pallet is 206 inches long, 113 inches wide and 10 inches thick.  The pallet shall be fabricated from 1 ? inch carbon steel plate (pre-finished) (ASTM A-36) supported by a honeycomb structure of S8 X 23 carbon steel S- Beams (ASTM A-36).  On the underside of the pallet where the S-Beams intersect 1 inch carbon steel plate (pre-finished) (ASTM A-36) is welded to form support pads.  All welding shall be performed to meet American Welding Society Specification D1.1.  All welds shall be stress relieved after the pallet is fabricated. The entire structure shall be supported to control distortions and dimensions and heated at the rate of 300o F per hour to 1150o F.  The 1150o F temperature shall be held for 2 hours after which it is cooled at the rate of 300o F per hour.  All stressed relieved welds shall be inspected by either magnetic particle inspection (ASTM E1444) or fluorescent dye penetrant inspection (ASTM 1417).  Acceptance of welds shall be based on criteria defined in MIL-STD-1907.  All welds found deficient shall be repaired or replaced.  The structure is to be sand blasted (SSPC-10) and immediately painted with one coat of polyamide epoxy primer.  The top and bottom surfaces shall be machined to a thickness of 10 inches with a 125 finish. The pallet has three critical characteristics. The top and bottom surfaces shall be flat and parallel to a tolerance of ? 0.005 inches.  Two V grooves shall be scribed on the top surface and the intersection of two grooves is critical for engine and transmission alignment on the pallet. The two grooves shall be perpendicular to each other with a tolerance of ? 0.003 inches.  Each groove is 0.125 inches wide by 0.0625 inches deep with a tolerance of ? 0.005 inches.  The pallet has a fore and aft alignment and containment pin assembly.  The pins assure proper alignment of pallet/engine and transmission in the test cell and absorb the torque loads generated during testing.  The pin assembly components are fabricated from 304 stainless steel and silicon bronze (AMS 4615) and have tolerances as low as + 0.001 inches.  All machined surfaces and threaded parts are to have corrosion protection material/grease applied and the balance of the pallet is to be painted with Navy Blue epoxy paint.  The pallet is estimated to weigh 12,000 pounds.  The contractor shall deliver and drop the Pallet at the Governments facility at Naval Air Station (N.A.S.), Patuxent River, MD; no hookup is required.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to purchase flight model pressure regulators from Autoflow under the authority of Only One Responsible Source, due to Autoflow's unique capabilities and its history as a partner in the development of the SAM instrument suite, which is part of the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory (MSL).  The data from the SAM suite provides critical information for understanding basic scientific facts underlying the investigation of habitability on the planet.   Autoflow has previously designed, developed, and delivered prototype miniature pressure regulators to the SAM project.	The requirement for flight regulators is a continuation of the current Autoflow prototype regulator that must fit into the existing SAM mounting structure.  The SAM pressure regulators are based on the Autoflow regulators manufactured for GSFC and used on the Cassini/Huygens mission.  These designs are proprietary to Autoflow and are of the highest technical readiness level of any regulator in industry.  They have flight heritage and will require minimum qualification testing.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on response date listed above.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration is seeking a contractor to provide Art Conservation Assistance Services for specialty art glass that will be moved from its existing location in Blaine, WA to an interim display location in Tacoma, WA.  Services will include but are not limited to:  identification (including photographic) and documentation of the condition of the art pieces; recommendations regarding the care and maintenance of the art pieces; oversight of the packing and moving process (moving and conservation services to be provided by the artist?s studio);  and, verification of the items prior to their installation in the display location.  The solicitation will likely include an option to provide the same services at a later date when the pieces are returned to Blaine, WA and installed at the new facility.  This will be a negotiated procurement handled in accordance with the Source Selection procedures outlined in FAR Part 15.  Selection will be based on the Low Price Technically Acceptable approach.  The Government may make award based on initial offers, so negotiations should not be assumed but may be conducted if it is found to be in the best interest of the Government.  Offerors shall consequently provide their best pricing with their initial proposal.  Offerors will submit technical and price proposal information in separate envelopes.  Go/No-Go technical evaluation factors against which offerors are likely to be evaluated include:  1. Ability to provide a Project Manager that is a certified professional by the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) of Historic & Artistic Works, and  2. The AIC professional is able to demonstrate recent (within the past 5 years), successful experience with art glass conservation work of an equivalent nature and complexity to that proposed for this project.  Offerors that meet these technical criteria will have their pricing proposals considered by GSA, with the intent of selecting the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) package for this procurement is expected to be available by June 20, 2007, with proposals due to GSA by July 3, 2007.  Interested contractors may contact the Contracting Officer specified below with questions and for copies of the RFP.  Due to the very specific nature of the technical qualifications of this RFP, this procurement will not be set aside exclusively for small business, but will be open to participation of large business to ensure adequate competition.  The small business size standard for this NAICS code (711510) is $6.5 Million.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Sensors Directorate (AFRL/SNR) solicits research proposals for conducting research and development in the areas of radio frequency sensor assessment for electronic support, electronic attack and electronic protection.  The primary focus is on active countermeasures evaluation and assessment for threat radar and communication systems in a free space radiation environment.  Advanced assessment tools and test beds are necessary to evaluate the effects of new and innovative electronic warfare countermeasures.  Research and development of radio frequency (RF), microwave, digital, and analog circuits and hardware as well as software development of graphical user interfaces, hardware control programs, and data acquisition processes will be necessary to develop new and innovative electronic warfare assessment technologies.  Development of assessment processes and procedures for various electronic warfare systems and countermeasure techniques will be required.  The effort will also require threat hardware functional assessments and characterization in support of RF jamming waveform effectiveness and optimization.  

Occasionally, field testing and R&D may be required when research goals at the remote site require one or more of the facility?s portable measurements systems, emulators, or jammers to conduct tests.  Remote R&D may include the design, fabrication and testing of hardware, the modification of existing software, and/or development of new software.

This effort can be divided into two general areas:

1.	Research and Development ? This will include providing subject matter expertise on electronic warfare systems, countermeasures, assessments, and applications, program planning, budgeting, and manning for R&D efforts in the RCA Lab, preparing system and technical reviews, writing technical manuals for hardware and software developed in the lab, developing and maintaining a project management plan for all research projects, and interfacing with external agencies and customers to facilitate collaboration, data sharing, and integration.

2.	Systems Engineering ? This will include strategic planning of R&D activities in the RCA Lab, defining and documenting system level requirements for hardware and software development, evaluating and recommending approaches to develop new assessment technologies and techniques, system design, layout, and modeling, and cost/benefit analysis of proposed research efforts.

The contractor will perform research and development on-site in the RF Countermeasures Assessment Lab (RCA) in building 620, Area B, Wright Patterson AFB, OH. 

Anticipated Funding:   $9,370,000

Please note that this is not a request for proposals at this time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), U.S. Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Acquisition  Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000 on behalf of the Office of PM Soldier  Weapons, has a requirement for a production ready Common Remotely Operated  Weapon Station (CROWS).  The CROWS is a remote weapon station capable of  mounting the MK19 grenade machine gun (GMG), M2 HB machine gun (MG), M240B  machine gun (MG) or M249 squad automatic weapon (SAW).  The CROWS is a multi- vehicle weapon mounting and control system which will allow the gunner to  remain inside the vehicle protected by armor while firing the weapon.  The  CROWS provides remote day and night sighting, ballistic control capability,  remote weapon charging, and first burst engagement of targets at the maximum  effective range of the weapon.  The CROWS weapon and sight are stabilized for  on-the-move identification and engagement of targets.  The CROWS will include  as a minimum: the weapon mount above the roof to include sensors, a fire  control processor, display and controls, and other associated hardware.  The  CROWS will be integrated into various turreted/non-turreted and ring-mount  equipped vehicles and will provide a modern automated weapon system that  enhances system lethality, increases battle space awareness, and provides  digital integration opportunities.  The CROWS will provide protection for the  gunner and enhanced target acquisition, identification, and engagement  capabilities to non-turreted armored vehicles which currently place the  unprotected gunner at high risk from enemy direct and indirect fire weapon  systems.  The Solicitation number for this is W15QKN-06-R-1409.  The present  schedule projects a release of a Draft Solicitation on or about 1 August 06  consisting of the Statement of Work, Performance Specification, Section  B Supplies or Services and Price/Cost, F Deliveries or Performance,  L Instrs., Conds., and Notices to Offerors and M Evaluation Factors for  Award.  The present schedule is  to release a final competitive Request for  Proposal (RFP) for a 4 year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ)  contract with a minimum quantity of 100 and a maximum quantity of 3400 no later  than 1 September 06.  This will be issued as an amendment to the solicitation  number W15QKN-06-R-1409.   Proposals and one complete bid sample unit will be  required within sixty (60) days after release of the final RFP.  All responses  to this notice shall be in writing in the English language.

This acquisition is for a firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base period for one unit. The base period will be approximately six months in length. The requirement is to repair and refurbish one empennage platform (hereinafter referred to as the tail stand) designed to service the tail components of C-5A aircraft.  The tail stand shall be brought to fully functional condition as per original design specifications.  The tail stand is a 70-ton (approximate), 70-foot tall, self-propelled lattice structure comprised of square tubing weldments.  The main structural members are four leg columns joined by bolting to structural fixed deck supports.  The structure is arranged to envelop the tail of the aircraft and provide six work levels, all connected by stairs and serviced by a 1000-pound capacity elevator.  The sixth work level provides access to the horizontal stabilizer.  Each work level consists of a fixed deck that houses a set of sliding deck panels that are manually pulled out to close the gap between the edge of the fixed deck and the vertical stabilizer.  The stand is also equipped with a 1000-pound capacity jib crane, a 1000-pound capacity traveling hoist on an I-beam, and four stabilizing jacks. The tail stand is supported by four two-wheel axles: two fixed axles are powered by a hydrostatic drive, and two steered axles are un-powered.  A 107 HP, 2800-RPM gasoline engine provides the power to drive and steer the stand at 2 mph in still air and at a slower speed against 40 mph wind. The nominal working pressure of the hydraulic system is 2000 psi.  When in position around the tail, the elevator, jib crane, and the hoist are powered through an electric cable from the hangar power source. 

The NAICS code is 332312 with a corresponding small business size standard (not to exceed) 500 Employees.

Request for Information
Postal Lab - Printing, Duplicating Services and Office Supplies

Request for Information Process

The United States Postal Service (USPS) requests information from companies that are interested in participating in an experimental retail arrangement.  The USPS has created dedicated leased space in a postal retail center(s) for the shared use by multiple vendors who will service small businesses and home-based businesses, the business traveler and walk-up postal retail customers.  The interior of this space uses non-traditional colors, finishes, signage and casework and has a more contemporary feel when compared to traditional Post Offices.

The postal center(s) is located in Chicago's suburb of Schaumburg near the area's largest shopping mall and a possible second site is located in a suburb of Washington, DC.  The USPS seeks general information from companies that support direct mail creation photocopying, faxing, mimeographing, laminating, other duplicating services including office supplies or other business related services such as binding and finishing services/materials.

Purpose

USPS is interested in exploring an environment that provides our customers convenient access to a variety of business and related retail services co-located within selected postal retail lobbies.  The design of new or possibly converted postal retail offices could be an outcome of the experiments in the Chicago site and possible Washington DC site.  

The experimental site provides a contemporary USPS environment featuring; stand-alone checkouts, self-service options, open merchandising, a conference room and consumer/visitor work area, and participants providing complimentary services geared toward the small business owner, offering the products and services germane to their needs.

USPS Provisions

The USPS will provide non-exclusive use of retail space to various consumer/small business companies whose main business fits into the above referenced areas of concentration.  A negotiated lease arrangement for the first year experiment with the USPS will be required prior to build out activities. The term is for one year with a possible extension for a second year after which both parties may at their choosing negotiates a new lease arrangement for a specified term and cost.  The USPS will provide facility access for additional hours than those noted above (consensus of USPS and vendor) to allow for stocking/service of vendor space. 

The USPS will provide 300 square feet of dedicated open retail space at the experimental site for a copy and print center operation which does not include common traffic area space between the various participant locations.  The USPS will provide on site storage as available and required.

The USPS will provide lease space to more than one business entity but only secure one photocopying and duplicating company per location.  The USPS will be a participant within the same environment providing for access to multiple Automated Postal Center kiosks selling postal services and control of the hourly rental of public conference meeting room space.

The USPS will provide casework or fixtures common to the operations of a company who is interested in participating in this experiment.  The USPS will provide access to a locked fixture storage area/room for a small quantity of on-the-floor inventory.  It will be a community storage area for all participants.  The USPS will provide for a central common work/seating area.

The USPS will provide access to common sanitary restroom facilities, ambient lighting, power, telecommunication services for each participating vendor's on-site employees however the participant will reimburse the USPS for costs incurred in accommodating any specialized setup at the vendor location.  The USPS contemplates offering free third party wireless fidelity internet connection service (Wi-Fi Certified) for use only by consumers during the experiment's term.  The USPS will request that each participating vendor arrange for services with their own internet services provider.  The USPS will also provide for building maintenance, utilities and trash removal activities in the areas designated for vendor activities.  The USPS will allow a company to utilize branding, logos, intellectual property icons or color schematics at experimental locations with USPS approval.  The USPS does not contemplate at this time to allow for external retail signage that conflicts with the look and feel of a US Postal Service Retail location.  However, the USPS is seeking suggestions and information on how external signage could be complimentary to our present look and feel.

The USPS does not seek any share in revenues for services provided or products sold during the experiment?s term.

<DESC>Background

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a small nonpartisan agency that provides economic and budgetary analysis to the Congress to aid in policy decisions. The agency is seeking contracts with experienced writers to prepare issue briefs and other documents.  Awards to multiple individuals to prepare one or more briefs each are anticipated over a 12-month period based on a firm-fixed job rate.  The agency may, at its option, contract with one or more individuals for additional briefs based on performance under the initial contracts.  Contract services shall include but are not limited to summarizing or drawing information from one or more full-length publications and sources to produce stand-alone documents, known as "issue briefs," which are clearly written, accessible, and aimed particularly at a broad audience--including Members of Congress, Congressional staff, and members of the public. The work will require independent judgment and initiative but will include collaboration with the agency's analysts, editors, and managers.  This collaboration will take place on-site.  Therefore, while most of the work will be done off-site, the individual will be expected to meet with CBO staff in their Washington, DC, offices.  Contract prices will be negotiated on the basis of the complexity of the original publication(s) on which the brief will be based.  Travel expenses are not allowed under this agreement.

<DESC>A.	 General Information The Europe Region (TRBO Europe), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 55 Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Southwest Asia announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Blood Collection Tubes. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination for blood collection tubes that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized produ cts be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, via USAMMCE.  The major facilities in the Region include but are not limited to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, U. S. Army Hospital Heidelberg, 48th Medical Group RAF Lakenheath, 52nd Medical Group Spangdahlem, 86th Medical Group Ramstein, 39th Medical Group Incirlik , 65th Medical Group Azores, U. S. Naval Hospital Naples, U. S. Naval Hospital Rota, U. S. Army Health Center - Vicenza, U. S. Army Medical Activity Bavaria, 31st Medical Group Aviano, U. S. Naval Hospital Sigonella, U. S. Army 30th Medical Brigade, and U.  S. CENTCOM. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAP A) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow the Prime Vendor to distribute their items. This is a supplement to t he Prime Vendor Program, and not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is July 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be  determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria with pricing being least important.   Point of Contact is Mrs. Marcee Whisenant, 011-49-6221-172109, marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil B.	Products & Performance Required The Europe Region is seeking product line items in the category of Blood Collection Tubes.  The estimated total volume for this product line in the Europe Region for this is $233,704. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period.  At the request of the Europe Region Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide product support to sites if requested, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS informa tion, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor. C.	Instructions to Offerors DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to marcee.whisenant@us.army.mil  Submissions must be received prior to the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  All interested offerors are to provide electronic responses by e-mail.  This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, samples to evaluate at no charge and complete product literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for  e-mail to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Europe Region TRBO its initial submission, quote, and literature actually arrived at the Europe Region T RBO via e-mail.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmissions before the due date/time should a problem occur with the first submission.  As stated above, vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline wil l be disqualified.   D.	 Evaluation Criteria The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Europe Region. They are the decision makers for this  initiative. Phase I:  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the criteria.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine acceptability.  All technical/company criteria are equally weighted.  After review of  the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  Phase II:   The CPT will request literature review material from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities.  Vendors are required to ship literature to the Europe TriService Regional Business Office (TRBO).  Vendo rs will be given 10 business days to ship samples.  Literature review material must be shipped to the TRBO by COB, 5:00PM EST on the 10th business day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to ship by the deadline will be disqualified from further cons ideration in the standardization process. Vendors must forward a verification of shipment to the TRBO. Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert scale of one to five rating.  One is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The CPT has set a 3.0 0 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.00 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  Phase III:  After the technical/company and clinical/performance evaluations are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum 3.00 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed vol ume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Europe Region. Technical/company and clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option period s (not to exceed 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.   1.	Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation The CPT will review the following technical/company criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria:  Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate t hat: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoters responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Owens & Minor,  the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoters information pro vided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Company Information: 1.

Information Resources Management Conferences
Request for Information (RFI)



PURPOSE:

The GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy (OGP), Office of Technology Strategy, Interagency Policy & Management Division (MEA) intends to advance its market research using this RFI as a tool to seek information as followed:  
     
(1)	Provide the best possible acquisition strategy for both the government and the vendor community.
(2)	How the vendors view the feasibility of our strategy.
(3)	To obtain information that helps the government understand from a vendor?fs perspective, what is relevant in making the acquisition marketable?   
(4)	 How incentives might be offered in our acquisition strategy. 
The intent of the RFI response is to seek the perspective of the vendor community regarding the market research approach intended for this acquisition.

The MEA division plans to conduct individual meetings with interested vendors that respond to the RFI to further clarify and discuss the questions below, and to get a clear understanding of the vendor?fs viewpoint on the planned marketing strategy.  These meetings will be scheduled between June 25 and June 28, 2007.  Vendors who submit written responses to the below questions by June 21, 2007 at 5 pm EST, will receive further instructions regarding the individual meetings. 

RFI QUESTIONNAIRE:

1.	Overall, do you believe our acquisition strategy is feasible?  Will it work for your firm?  How do you see the Government making this an acquisition that will work for Government as well as industry?

2.	The Government wants to attain a goal of at least 250 (up to 450) government conference attendees at IRMCO 2008.  In order to reach this goal, the Government plans to offer contractors an incentive for its marketing and following-up efforts.  If the goal is reached, the Government will allow an increased number of sponsor representatives during the conference.  Do you see this as a good incentive as a vendor?  Please explain.  Are there other viable incentives you recommend to optimize this acquisition strategy? 

3.	Currently the ratio of attendees at IRMCO is 3:1 government to vendor.  With this being a premiere government conference, the current ratio works well for the government.  From a vendor?fs point of view, how do you view this ratio?  What approaches can be employed to ensure, this ratio provides that?   How can we make this work better for you, while keeping the brand positioning of the IRMCO conference?       

4.	What is the typical number and composition of skills of the team committed to a conference similar to IRMCO?  Are they usually working exclusive on one conference or working on multiple conferences?

5.	What type of networking activities do you see as beneficial for IRMCO?

6.	Given the funding and budgeting strategy stated in this acquisition, will the goals be achievable for both government and industry?  Can the costs be kept to a minimum for attendees, i.e. preferably between $300 and $800?  What concerns you about this process?  What might you suggest as a viable strategy?

7.	What is an effective marketing plan to reach different management communities in the CFO, CIO, CAO and HR communities?

8.	Are the goals and the requirements in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) clear and understandable?  Are there areas that need to be further clarified? SOW is located in Amendment 01 of this RFI. 

9.	Provide comments to the draft SOW.

10.	Are there issues that we have not addressed that should be included in the RFI?

<DESC>The purpose of this is to amend the Sources Sought originally posted under the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm Reference-Number-ERRSIII-Region I. All information related to the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm Reference-Number-ERRSIII-Region I is now posted under the  Superfund/RCRA Regional Procurement Operations Division (SRRPOD) at  http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/  under Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS).  The new reference number is PR-HQ-07-12299.  Information relating to the Region 1 Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) will no longer be posted at http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/errsregion1/index.htm. Amendment 1 - Sources Sought   EPA is requesting additional information to evaluate the experience/capability of vendors interested in responding to the Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) III requirement for EPA Region I.  If you previously submitted a qualification package and would like to expand on your company's responses regarding the following questions, please forward your response to Jody Gosnell, Placement Contracting Officer at gosnell.jody@epa.gov.  If you have not submitted a qualification package and would like to, please refer to the Sources Sought Notice posted on March 22, 2007 on EPA's webpage at URL http://www.epa.gov/oam/regions/index.htm#sources under Emergency and Rapid Response Services (ERRS) for Region 1 and please to the page limit in the Sources Sought Notice.  All new qualification package submittals should address the questions below.  If you have already submitted a qualification package and are addressing the questions below please limit your response to no more than 1 page (single sided 12 point text). All qualification packages (new or revised) are due to Jody Gosnell via email at gosnell.jody@epa.gov by 3:30pm on Thursday, June 27, 2007.   1) Is your company interested in the entire requirement? A number of the companies who responded indicated interest in the entire requirement although it appeared that some of the qualification packages (Statement of Qualification/SOQ) did not adequately address all the capability elements specified in the requirement.  In some instances vendors anticipate ramping up within the Region if they are awarded a contract, however, for the purposes of our Market Research, the Region does not want to incorrectly assume a vendor is prepared to perform the full requirement.  We are requesting that any vendor who is interested in performing only a portion of the requirement indicate that fact and state the portion(s) of the requirement that they are willing to do.  Before responding please read the rest of this message.   2)  Level A Team requirements, and 3)  Emergency Response Times   The two elements above have been revised in the Draft PWS.  All interested vendors should submit the information as follows on both: Level A Team:  The number of personnel required has been reduced to 7 which include two (2) three-person entry teams and a Response Manager.  Many of the vendors responded indicating they had Level A capabilities but did not indicate their ability to mobilize a Level A team. Initial emergency response time frames: The 24/7 emergency response mobilization times have been relaxed for certain portions of the Region.  To ensure consistency in evaluation of vendor capability assumptions are provided regarding distances traveled per hour which we believe can be reasonably achieved.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS)For Air Force Requirements Team Modeling for the Air Force Logistics Management Agency
Air Force Logistics Management Agency
501 Ward Street
Maxwell AFB, Gunter Annex, Alabama 36114-3236
1. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
Background
Among the research and logistics studies the Air Force Logistics Management Agency (AFLMA) performs, it also supports programming, modeling and performs many recurring technical tasks for the AF Requirements Team (AFRT).  These tasks are very important to the accuracy and effectiveness of Air Force peacetime and contingency requirements and levels. One such task is to process, maintain, and validate changes to the Readiness Based Leveling (RBL) model program.  RBL is an Air Force centralized stock leveling methodology used to minimize expected base-level back orders.  RBL was implemented in 1997 and is used to determine when and where to stock assets for the highest value to the Air Force as a whole, rather than optimizing levels at particular bases or locations.
Objectives
The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) shall be to obtain the necessary contractor support to perform programming, modeling and recurring technical tasks for the Air Force Requirements Team (AFRT).  The RBL model program code is a METRIC (Multi-Echelon Technique for Recoverable Item Control)-based model written in FORTRAN (Formula Translation).  It is complex and requires experienced FORTRAN programmers to understand and make changes to it.  There are specific inputs from Air Force supply systems that are used in the model: D200A Requirements file, SBSS (Standard Base Supply System), and D035E Adjusted Stock Level (ASL) Database.  The model provides an output of wholesale (such as depot) and retail (such as base) demand levels. The contractor should also be experienced with project research, both as research lead and as a research team member. Research is necessary to identify known and potential problems affecting item levels, and to develop and recommend possible solutions. It is used to make decisions relating to changes in RBL. The research should be rigorous enough to meet standards established for peer-reviewed studies.   Therefore relevant skills and experience required to provide this service are in-depth knowledge and recent experience with SBSS, recent experience in FORTRAN coding, knowledge of multi-echelon/tiered inventory modeling, recent experience with supply system modeling, and recent experience with project research. The Air Force needs technical support to maintain the RBL program code, to run recurring RBL review and analysis tasks, to assist in the annual validation of Contingency High Priority Mission Support Kits (CHPMSK), and to assist the AFLMA in analysis efforts to improve RBL and supply chain process. 
Scope
The contractor shall provide support to process, maintain, and validate changes to the RBL model FORTRAN (Formula Translation) program.  Although the AF is ultimately responsible for the accuracy of the RBL code, the contractor shall perform and document validation and verification of all changes to the RBL code.  Verification of code changes shall be made by individuals separate from those making the coding changes.   If code changes are accomplished and validated by the contractor, the results of the validation and testing shall be provided to the government, through either the AFLMA or Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC) for review and approval before the code becomes operational.  
In support of the AFLMA  and the AFRT mission, the contractor shall assist in analysis efforts to improve RBL, verify RBL is running properly (quarterly RBL run validation) and validate CHPMSKs.
1.1 RBL Support
1.1.1. The contractor shall verify and validate RBL code changes to accommodate process and policy changes as described in AFMAN 23-100 or needed to assist the AF with analysis efforts.
1.1.2. In support of the AFLMA and the AFRT, the contractor shall assist in analysis efforts to improve RBL, verify RBL is running properly (quarterly RBL run validation) and validate CHPMSKs.
1.1.3. The contractor shall work with the AFLMA and HQ AFMC Supply Management Division (AFMC/LGYR), to provide RBL analysis support.  The contractor shall modify the code to analyze alternative ways for the AF to allocate levels for AF and contractor-managed items.  Analysis efforts will include setting levels for CHPMSKs and normalizing kits on an as-required basis. On occasion an urgent CHPMSKs analysis may need to be accomplished with a turnaround in as little as 24 hours. The contractor shall document their analysis efforts. 
1.1.4. The contractor shall the development, testing and operation of applications using the Air Force Logistics Studies Workshop (AFLSW) located at the AFLMA.  There are several current applications of the AFLSW, including the Issue/Stockage Effectiveness tool, the 7SC quarterly transaction, and the Weapon System Support Program (WSSP).  The contractor shall assist the AFLMA in developing new applications as they arise and running current applications on a recurring basis.
1.1.5. The contractor shall perform quarterly reconciliations of requisition, essentiality, and application data between legacy retail and wholesale supply systems operated by the Air Force and the Defense Logistics Agency.
1.1.6. The contractor shall attend AFRT and related meetings and other working level meetings convened by the AFLMA, AFMC/LGYR, or Headquarters Air Force Supply Chain Management (HQ AF/A4RM) in pursuit of these analysis efforts.
1.1.7. The contractor shall perform transition to sustainment analyses.  This entails running RBL normally (without existing CHPMSKs and maximum levels) and communicating these results with the affected bases and Major Commands (MAJCOMs) for potential adjustment to CHPMSK levels. 
1.1.8.  The contractor shall perform project research, both as the research lead and as a research team member.  Research is necessary to identify known and potential problems affecting item levels, and to develop and recommend possible solutions.  Studies may be assigned by the AFLMA, AFRT, or developed by the contractor.  The AFLMA must approve contractor-developed studies prior to the contractor starting the research. The research should be rigorous enough to meet standards established for peer-reviewed studies.  The research results should be captured in technical papers/reports and research project reports.  Some studies may be published in the Air Force Journal of Logistics.  At a minimum the contractor shall complete four studies annually.

Beneficiaries may choose between the traditional, fee-for-service Medicare program, and a private health plan option referred to as Medicare Advantage Program.  The Medicare program consists of two primary parts: 

1.	Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as "Part A;" and 
	
2.	Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), also known as "Part B."  
	
	Medicare Part A covers some of the costs of providing medically necessary inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care following a hospital stay, home health care, and hospice care.  Individuals entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are automatically entitled to Part A hospital insurance beginning with the first day of the month in which the individual attains the age of 65.  Those younger than age 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits and those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are also entitled to Part A.  Individuals who worked in certain Medicare-qualified federal, state, or local government employment may also qualify for coverage provided certain conditions are met.
	
	Medicare Part B helps pay for certain physician services (in both hospital and non-hospital settings,) outpatient hospital services, and many other medical services, equipment, and supplies not covered under Part A.  Part B benefits are available to almost anyone age 65 or older regardless of entitlement to Medicare Part A and to disabled beneficiaries entitled to Part A.  Part B is an "optional program," meaning that eligible individuals may elect or decline to enroll in the program, which requires payment of a monthly premium.
	
	The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has overall responsibility for administering the Medicare Program, with assistance from the Social Security Administration (SSA).  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency of DHHS, administers the Medicare Program on a day-to-day basis, including formulation and promulgation of Medicare Program policy and guidance; contract execution, operation and management; maintenance and review of utilization records; providing inquirers with basic information;  general Medicare financing.  The DHHS is responsible for adjudicating ALJ hearing requests of Medicare claim appeals.  SSA is responsible for determining whether an individual is entitled to Medicare and for maintaining the Medicare master beneficiary record. 
	
	Sections 1816 and 1842 of the Act provide that public or private entities and agencies may participate in the administration of the Medicare Program under contracts or agreements entered into with CMS.  These Medicare contractors are known as Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs) and carriers.  FIs perform Medicare claims processing and benefit payment functions for institutional providers in Part A and Part B of the program. Carriers perform Medicare claims processing and benefit payment functions for Part B.  
	
	The Medicare Modernization Act required CMS to undergo contract reform in which the Part A and Part B functions would be combined and performed by a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC).  The MACs are being implemented by jurisdiction on a gradual basis.  Therefore, QICs interact with both MACs and as well as traditional Medicare contractors.
	
	There are four Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (DME MACs or DMACs), each serving approximately one geographic quarter of the nation.  CMS has also established separate contracts with four FIs to handle home health and hospice claims.  These contracted entities are called Regional Home Health Intermediaries (RHHIs).
	
	For the purposes of this document, when referring to FIs, carriers, MACs, DMACs, and RHHIs, in general, we will refer to them as affiliated contractors (ACs).
		
	The Medicare FFS Appeals Process:
	
	Under the original Medicare plan, a beneficiary may generally obtain health services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to participate in the Medicare program that undertakes to provide the service to the individual.  After the care is provided, the provider or supplier (or, in some cases, a beneficiary) submits a claim for benefits under the Medicare program to the appropriate AC.  If the claim is for an item or service that falls within a Medicare benefit category, is medically reasonable and necessary for the individual, and is not otherwise statutorily excluded, then the contractor pays the claim.  However, the Medicare program does not cover all health care expenses.  If the Medicare contractor determines that the medical care is not covered under the Medicare program, it denies the claim. 
	
	When an AC denies a claim, it notifies the provider, supplier and/or beneficiary of the denial, and, if appropriate, offers the opportunity to appeal this decision.  The existing appeals procedures for original Medicare are set forth in regulations at 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 405 Subpart I-Determinations, Redeterminations, Reconsiderations and Appeals under Original Medicare (Part A and Part B).  The section of the regulation specific to the QIC level of appeal begin at 42 CFR 405.960.  
	The CFR can be accessed online by going to the following website: http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html.
	
	Once a claim has been denied, the beneficiary, provider, supplier or their authorized representative may appeal the claim to the contractor that made the initial determination. The request must be filed within 120 of the initial determination.  This first level of appeal is known as a redetermination. The individual conducting the redetermination must not have been involved in making the initial determination and must issue a decision to all parties to the appeal within 60 days of receipt of the appeal request.
	
	If the appellant is dissatisfied with the redetermination decision, then they may request a reconsideration with the QIC within 180 days from the date of the redetermination decision.  The QIC then has 60 days from the date of receipt of the reconsideration request to: (1) issue a decision; (2) notify the appellant they will be unable to complete their request within the 60 day timeframe and offer the appellant the option to escalate their appeal to the next level of the appeals process; or (3) dismiss the request.
	
	If the appellant is dissatisfied with the QIC's reconsideration, then they may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).  The appellant has 60 days from the date of the QIC's reconsideration to request a hearing and the ALJ has 90 days to issue a decision.
	
	If an appellant continues to be dissatisfied with the ALJ's decision they may request a review with the Medicare Appeals Council at the Departmental Appeals Board. The appellant has 60 days to request a review with the Medicare Appeals Council and if the Medicare Appeals Council accepts the request, the Medicare Appeals Council has 90 days to issue a decision.  This is the last stage of the administrative appeals process and appellants who continue to be dissatisfied can appeal to federal district court.

WORK & TASKS:
1)	Perform an on-site evaluation of each of the fee-for-service (FFS) QICs.
2)	Determine if the QIC is performing the functions in their task order statement of work in accordance with CMS rules, regulations, and policy guidance.
3)	Perform a minimum of one, annual, on-site evaluation, of not less than one business week in length, at each FFS QIC and the Administrative QIC (AdQIC). There are 6 QICs.
4)	Employ a team of individuals that together possess knowledge of the Medicare appeals process, familiarity with Medicare coverage guidelines and the clinical expertise to evaluate the medical necessity determinations made by QIC Panel reviewers.
5)	Review a random sample of not less than 100 closed QIC (per QIC) cases adjudicated during the review period.  Review periods will differ by QIC and will be provided by CMS.
6)	Examine the QICs adherence to CMS procedural requirements, such as acknowledging the reconsideration request within 14 days; issuing a decision, dismissal or effectuation notice within 60 days of receipt of the request; and forwarding effectuation notices timely; etc.
7)	Review the QICs adherence to CMS's policy of forwarding decisions and effectuation information to the affiliated contractors (for purposes of this document, affiliated contractors refers to carriers, fiscal intermediaries and Medicare Administrative Contractors including durable medical equipment MACs).
8)	Review the QICs' decisions to determine quality, accuracy, consistency and timeliness. Decisions should provide an adequate rationale for the decision and conform to Medicare?s national coverage guidelines, rules and regulations.
9)	Develop evaluation protocols that will be used during QIC evaluations and submit them for CMS approval.
10)	Develop a report based on the results of each QIC evaluation and submit it to CMS for approval.
11)	Recommend process improvements or identified educational needs at each QICs' operation.
12)	Develop a master report comparing the QICs' performance and any inconsistencies in QIC decision-making across QICs.
13)	Review each QIC's rebuttal to the evaluation finding, if a rebuttal is submitted, and any supporting documentation submitted.

<DESC>The service provider shall provide the necessary products and services to accomplish all of the requirements stated herein.
The Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) in the Department of State seeks to institute a credit and/or debit card based system to manage its obligation for providing diplomatic tax-relief privileges for foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations and their members throughout the United States.  This new system will be referred to as the Diplomatic Tax-Exempt Credit/Debit (TECD) Program.    

OFM seeks from the private sector proposals for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges initiated through the use of a provider issued ?tax-exempt? credit and/or debit card to foreign missions, international organizations and their eligible personnel.  ?Tax-Exempt? means vendors should exempt or remove charges associated with most taxes on purchases made using such cards.  The U.S. government will not underwrite or assume any liability for these credit/debit cards, and also will not guarantee payment of the debts on these credit cards. All risk in extending credit will fall on the credit issuer.  

OFM hopes to eventually provide diplomatic tax-relief privileges solely through a credit/debit card-based system.  However, it accepts that technological and programmatic issues stand as current obstacles to achieving this vision.   Therefore, this credit/debit card will serve as one of two systems that OFM will make available to the foreign mission and international organization community for obtaining diplomatic tax.  OFM estimates that such credit/debit cards will be used frequently and will likely have a higher average use-rate in comparison to those issued to average consumers.  

The tax-exemption identification cards that OFM currently produces will continue to exist as an option for the provision of diplomatic tax-relief privileges.  However, the option to use the existing system will only be available to certain individuals.  Therefore, the majority of the diplomatic and international community will receive their tax-relief benefits through the TECD Program.  Each mission/organization will have the option of using either the existing tax-exemption identification card system or the new TECD Program.  In the event the selected bank is unable to provide services to a mission/organization or their members, they will be able to use the existing system.   

There are roughly 9,000 diplomatic tax-exemption cards currently circulating throughout the United States.  

The provision of this service will attract the operating accounts of many foreign missions and international organizations as well as their members to the bank selected for this program.  Therefore, service providers stand to generate new revenues not only from providing this system, but also through the added customer and deposit base that goes along with providing banking services to such account holders.  

As a point of reference concerning the credit worthiness of foreign missions and their members, in conjunction with participating oil companies, OFM has provided ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards to foreign missions and diplomats since the mid-1980s.  Although, the tax-relief mechanism used with this card is vastly different from the one described in this document, the extension and management of credit to foreign missions and their members is basically identical.   Over the past 20 years, the service providers of the ?tax-exempt? gasoline credit cards have reported extremely few problems concerning foreign missions or their members as routinely delinquent or unable to pay balances on such accounts.  A list of the oil companies that participate in the ?tax-exempt gasoline credit card program can be viewed on the OFM website at www.state.gov/ofm/tax/gasoline/24625.htm.  

OFM will permit the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) to participate in the TECD program to facilitate its responsibility to provide tax-relief privileges to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) and its members.  These privileges are established under the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.   AIT will serve most of the roles/responsibilities identified for OFM in this document.  

This solicitation not only offers the opportunity for service providers to present a solution to OFM?s business process needs for a credit and/or debit card based diplomatic tax relief program, but to propose added services that might realize the Department of State?s vision of electronic and streamlined government business processes, both domestically and abroad.

Currently, OFM plans to offer this opportunity to all service providers capable of meeting or exceeding the requirements established in this document.   

Background of the Diplomatic Tax Exemption Process:
The Foreign Missions Act of 1982 (22 USC 4301-4316) requires that OFM manage the U.S. Government?s provision of certain diplomatic privileges on the basis of reciprocity.  The U.S. Government?s obligation to provide diplomatic tax relief is primarily a result of both the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.  However, this privilege is also an obligation of various other bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, such as the United Nations Headquarters? Agreement. 

The authority to authorize TECRO and its members for tax-relief privileges is an obligation of AIT in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act (PL 96-8) of April 10, 1979.      

Due to the reciprocity requirement in the Foreign Missions Act, OFM is required to provide foreign missions with diplomatic tax relief privileges to the extent that each counterpart foreign government provides such relief to the U.S. diplomatic mission and its members.  Therefore, OFM limits or denies tax exemption to missions that limit or deny tax relief to U. S. diplomatic representatives in the host country.

1.  PROJECT TITLE
Remote Monitoring of Utility Meters and Evaluations of Utility Information

2.0  BACKGROUND
The objective is to pilot a demonstrations project, either a FEMA facility in Alabama or FEMA facilities in Maryland remotely retrieve utility meter information, report all necessary utility usage and costs, and other DHS required energy management information.   Monthly and quarterly the contractor will retrieve all of the required utility and energy management information; compile the information in a format that will be sent to DHS and FEMA; and annually report all energy management information to DHS and FEMA.  

3.0  SCOPE
In order to comply with Executive Order 13423 (EO13423), DHS has mandated that all its components to report monthly, quarterly, and annually certain energy management information.  At the present time in order to comply with this DHS mandate, FEMA program office personnel must forward on a timely basis their utility invoices to the FEMA Policy and Oversight office.  The Policy and Oversight office in turn must review each utility invoice and prepare a spreadsheet with all the utility information.  Quarterly the Policy and Oversight office must submit to DHS the spreadsheet, along with other pertinent location use information. Other pertinent information would be, but not be limited to, energy audits, renewable energy projects, and disaster surge personnel or other increased usage at a location.
 
Currently FEMA has over one hundred and fifteen (115) utility meters at twelve (12) program offices throughout the continental United States.   This project will be a demonstration project for remote monitoring, processing of information of from between 30-50 meters. This number is expected to increase as certain proposed new FEMA locations come on line, and DHS also mandates that even disaster facilities, where FEMA pays the utilities, are required to report utility information. 

In a presentation at a DHS Energy Management Council meeting, DHS Energy manager discussed that numerous agencies use contractor support to meet E.O. 13423 and to provide remote monitoring and record development packages.

<SUBJECT>V -- Trawler for Alaska Bycatch Research
<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of small business concerns for a requirement for a trawl vessel to conduct studies of gear performance and fish behavior in trawls, as well as studies of trawl modifications to reduce effects on seafloor habitat features.  The charter will consist of 10 days of charter, with an option for the Government to extend the contract for up to 12 additional charter days. This is a multi-year charter, which can be extended for similar work for any of the three subsequent years at the Government?s option. Activities may include both pelagic and bottom trawling (the vessel may return to port to change gear if necessary). Some tows may result in capture of commercial amounts of groundfish. The contractor will arrange the handling and sale of any such fish, deducting proceeds of such sales from the charter fee. Studies may also include towing a camera/sonar sled across the seafloor at speeds as slow as 2 knots. The vessel must have the capability to navigate designated tow paths at such a slow speed. 

The first period of charter will be a 1-2 day gear test during September 2007. Exact timing of this test can be very flexible.  The remainder of the work will occur between May 1 and September 30, 2008. 

Vessel specifications should be as follows:

1. Minimum overall length 36.5 m (120 ft).

2. Minimum main engine continuous horsepower of at least 1000.  The vessel must be able to tow the provided pelagic trawl at 3.5 knots or faster. The vessel must have a demonstrable capability to maintain a speed of at least 16.8 km/hr (9 kts) cruising speed in reasonable seas.  Vessel must have sufficient fuel holding capacity to conduct scientific operations for at least 20 days without refueling.  

3. Completely rigged and ready to fish, including the following:

			a. Commercial scale trawl rigging.

			b. Two net reels, one with at least 6.1 m (20 ft) of clear deck between it and a stern ramp.  Both net reels must have sufficient capacity to fish the contractor-provided pelagic trawl.

 
			
			c. Split trawl winches with a minimum of 1372 m (750 fm) of 1.6 cm (5/8 in) diameter or larger trawl cable in good condition on each drum.  Winches should be capable of retrieving the research trawl at a rate of at least 61 m (200 ft) per minute and capable of paying out the cable between 30 to 91 m (100 to 300 ft) per minute.

			d. Trawl cable runs must be directly from the winches to the gallows trawl blocks.
	
4.		One commercial pelagic trawl with headrope and footrope each at least 61 m (200 ft) in length, in good repair, rigged and ready to fish, with all commercial scale accessories (i.e. doors, tailchains, sweeps, weights, and bridles) necessary to fish in the Alaska midwater pollock fisheries.  Offerors shall supply full net and rigging plans for proposed gear and a listing of the midwater fisheries in which it has been used.


5. 	  One commercial bottom trawl with headrope and footrope each at least 24 m (80 ft) in length, in good repair, rigged and ready to fish, with all commercial scale accessories (i.e. doors, tailchains, sweeps, bridles, and codend) necessary to fish in the Alaska bottom trawl fisheries. (It will not be required to have all equipment (including doors and trawl) for both bottom and pelagic trawl on-board at the same time, as they will be used for separate parts of the research. If necessary, the vessel will return to port to change gear.)
 
			a. Contractor will allow and assist installation of government-provided experimental modifications to the trawl. Such modifications will be removed before the end of the work. 

b. Offerors shall supply full net and rigging plans for proposed pelagic trawl and associated rigging and a listing of the midwater fisheries in which it has been used.

6. A clean, flush deck area for scientific sampling and stowage of gear components that is at least 74 sq. m (800 sq. ft) and has the following characteristics:

			a. Relatively clear of running gear, equipment and stowage.

			b. Adequate illumination to enable scientific operations under all conditions.

			c. Adequate space for one (1) 1 m x 2 m (3 ft x 6 ft) specimen table.

			d. Seawater deck hose for cleaning of sampling gear; must have capability to reduce water pressure if needed; and, the On/Off switch should be readily available from the working deck.

 
			e. Freshwater deck hose for occasional use to wash scientific instruments and other sensitive gear.

7. The vessel must have the ability to navigate designated tracks at speeds as low as 1.5 knots while towing a seafloor sled. The vendor will describe how this will be accomplished (For example, using a variable pitch propeller and bow thruster).

8. A hydraulic crane and lifting gear for handling fishing gear, as much as 4.5 mt (5 t); must have capability to extend out 3 m (10 ft) past the side of the vessel; and must be capable of raising or lowering anywhere on the working deck.

9. Dry storage areas

			a. At least 5.4 cu m (190 cu ft) in the deck house for holding scientific supplies.


10. Protected work spaces

			a. A sheltered area (covered from above and forward) on or adjacent to the fishing deck for storage, staging and handling of Government owned equipment.  This area shall be at least 1.2 m x 2.4 m (4 ft x 8 ft) and shall not include any space needed for emergency passage or used during routine fishing operations.

			b. A dry, heated and lighted area preferably measuring 3 m x 4.6 m (10 ft x 15 ft), or 13.8 sq. m (150 sq. ft) overall, with a 1 m x 0.5 m (3 ft x 1.5 ft) desk/bench top space.  The desk space requirement could be reduced with adequate space above for stacking equipment and need not be contiguous.  This area must be suitable for computer/electronic equipment and be adjacent to 110/115 VAC power outlets.  The area may be located either in the deck house, deck locker or fully enclosed shelter deck, but must have easy access to the deck; provide easy, safe access for routing cables with connectors in and out of the area.

 
			c. One suitable desk or shelf area at least 0.6 m x 1.2 m (2 ft x 4 ft) with adjacent 110/115 VAC power outlets for installation of Government supplied personal computers and printers.  The desk or counter space should be located in an office space, which can be used almost exclusively by the scientific staff for entry and analysis of data on computers. Note: The dry, heated, and lighted spaces identified in Items b. and c. above can be met by one area if it can accommodate both needs.

			d. A suitable desk or dry counter work space of at least 0.6 m x 1.2 m (2 ft x 4 ft) on the bridge with adjacent 110/115 VAC power outlets for installation of Government supplied personal computers and printers; trawl mensuration equipment; and a GPS receiver.  Access to and use of a suitable chart table is also required on the bridge.

			e.

<SUBJECT>R -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ? MARKET RESEARCH, Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) Pay/Personnel Administrative Support Services (PASS)
<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil),  is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President?s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) activities throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and Guam.  PASS functions performed Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) are also being examined for possible transfer to CONUS for execution.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the PASS activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Fiscal Accountability, Administration, Passenger Transportation Support Services, Pay and Personnel Support, Training, and Customer Service.  Presently excluded from the scope are inherently governmental activities such as passport agent, disbursing officer, and transportation officer responsibilities.  OPNAVINST 4650.15, Passenger Transportation Manual and Draft OPNAVINST 1000.23C, PASS Manual are provided with this announcement to provide additional insight into the PASS activities.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Funded Military and Civilian Authorizations by PSA and PSD/CSD.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.  General information regarding the Personnel Support Activities (PSA), Personnel Support Detachments (PSD), and Customer Service Desks (CSD) set forth in Attachment 1 is available at www.psasd.navy.mil.  Note, however, that the PASS Program is currently undergoing a reorganization that includes the Apr 07 establishment of the Navy Pay and Personnel Support Center (NPPSC) responsible for providing management, oversight and training to PSDs, the Apr 07 disestablishment of PSA Atlantic and its reestablishment as PSA West Detachment under PSA West providing for the consolidation of CONUS activities, and the eventual realignment of PSA Pacific and PSA Europe under NPPSC scheduled for Oct 07.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy (DoN), Commander, Navy Installations Command  (CNIC) (www.cnic.navy.mil),  is conducting preliminary planning to determine whether competitive sourcing, under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_incl_tech_correction.html) and consistent with the President?s Management Agenda (www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2002/mgmt.pdf), is the optimal methodology for sourcing Pay/Personnel Administrative Support System Services (PASS) activities throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, and Guam.  PASS functions performed Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) are also being examined for possible transfer to CONUS for execution.

This Request for Information (RFI), which is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or otherwise pay for the information solicited, is intended to seek industry assistance in determining (1) the appropriate grouping of the PASS activities as business units, consistent with market and industry structures, and (2) whether there is sufficient industry interest and demonstrated capability to compete for these activities to support a decision to pursue competitive sourcing as the strategic sourcing solutions.  The present scope and grouping of these activities, which are subject to change as the preliminary planning process progresses, include:  Fiscal Accountability, Administration, Passenger Transportation Support Services, Pay and Personnel Support, Training, and Customer Service.  Presently excluded from the scope are inherently governmental activities such as passport agent, disbursing officer, and transportation officer responsibilities.  OPNAVINST 4650.15, Passenger Transportation Manual and Draft OPNAVINST 1000.23C, PASS Manual are provided with this announcement to provide additional insight into the PASS activities.

The aforementioned scope includes the Navy Regions, Installations, and Military, Civilian, and Contractor billets identified in Attachment 1, Funded Military and Civilian Authorizations by PSA and PSD/CSD.  With respect to the billet counts set forth in Attachment 1, note that they represent a rough order of magnitude and are subject to change as the preliminary planning process continues.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541310 with a small business size standard of $4.5M of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. 

General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service (PBS), Physical Capital Asset Management Division (PGE), is requesting services to create Building Preservation Plan User-Guide Handbook for Center for Historic Buildings.  

BACKGROUND:  

The Building Preservation Plan (BPP) database provides comprehensive information on individual GSA historic buildings to guide appropriate maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, and reinvestment. Each BPP includes a statement of significance, documentation on building alterations over time, images of current conditions, inventories of original materials, and schematic floor plans zoned to delineate the hierarchy of exterior and interior spaces as a guide to appropriate preservation and treatment. 

The original 1989 software was upgraded in 2003-2007 to operate in a web-based platform. As part of this upgrade, BPP fields not commonly used were omitted and additional fields added to provide more detailed documentation and analysis on existing conditions and treatment alternatives.  Requirements for photography were also upgraded to ensure that digital images are legible and usable. 

A major goal of the 2005 upgrade was to make the database more user friendly by eliminating alphanumeric codes, abbreviations, and terminology not commonly used by the profession, which necessitated the use of a key to enter data and read a BPP.  Another goal was to improve the screen layout and menus.  A user guide created for the original database focused on code and field definitions.  Having eliminated those user barriers, this new guide will encourage consistent terminology and aid users in making the most of this resource.

OBJECTIVES

A.  To create a user-guide handbook designed for quick reference and providing details for data entry, data retrieval, and database administration. 

B.  To develop the graphic design layout and all pre-press services, including color corrected artwork, for the printing of the user guide.

C.  Principal goals of the user guide are:

1.  Simplify data entry and ensure content consistency.

2.  Enable users to understand and fully utilize the database content as efficiently as possible.  

3.  Promote widespread use of the BPP by GSA Associates and Project Teams.

III. Past Performance

Past performance will be evaluated based on the following:

This criterion measures the relevancy of the offeror's past experience to the requirements of this project.  Offerors shall provide a list of seven relevant projects that have like or similar requirements over the past five years. In addition, this criterion measures the quality of the offeror's past performance for similar projects as defined herein.  Quality is judged with respect to work quality, administration, cost control, cooperation, and adherence to schedule and will be evaluated through reference checks made by the Government on relevant projects, completed or in progress.  

In assessing past performance, the Government will use past and present performance data to evaluate an offeror's ability to perform the contract requirements.  The recentness and relevancy of the past performance will be critical in determining the Past Performance rating. Offerors lacking relevant and recent past performance history shall receive a neutral evaluation for this factor. 

Minimum requirements for past performance include:

1. Offeror references confirm responsiveness, quality of work, timeliness

2. Offeror work samples demonstrating relevant experience, such as development of technical guidance for historic building maintenance, repair or alteration,, or online or published instructional material and building preservation plans or preservation reports that included guidance.

IV. Price

The total evaluated price will not be rated or scored but will be evaluated for reasonableness.  In no case will a contract be awarded at an unreasonable price.  Reasonableness for the type and quality of services being provided will be determined based upon prices submitted by the competition, current market conditions, the independent previous prices for the same/similar services, and the Government estimate.  Any individual item, which is unreasonable, may cause the entire proposal to be determined unreasonable and result in elimination from award consideration.

Consistent with the best value concept, technical merit and pricing will be considered together to determine how advantageous the offers are to the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are significantly more important than price, but no specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes.  A proposed award to a higher-priced, higher-scored offeror must be supported by specific supporting rationale that the technical superiority of the higher priced offer, relative to other offers in the competitive range, warrants the additional expense.

Whether or not a given point spread between two competing proposals indicates significant superiority of one proposal over another will depend on the facts and circumstances of each proposal. The determinative element is not the difference in point scores itself, but the content of the relative strengths and weaknesses synthesized to form the basis of selection.  The final evaluation report must reasonably support the conclusion that the award recommendation is rationally founded and consistent with the evaluation criteria stated in the solicitation.

Price proposals shall demonstrate:

1. Economical and efficient approach 

2. Competitive offer

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation No. NSR-07-173 herein is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-14.  This is not a small business set aside.  This RFP is for full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 325412.  

BACKGROUND ---  In April 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) revised 10 CFR 50.47(b)(10) of its emergency preparedness regulations.  The revised rule requires that States with population within the 10-mile emergency planning zone of commercial nuclear power plants, consider including potassium iodide (KI) as a protective measure for the general public to supplement sheltering and evacuation in the unlikely event of a severe nuclear power plant accident.  Concomitant with this action, the NRC offered to provide a supply of KI to each State or Tribe that incorporated KI for the general public into their emergency plans.  If local governments were designated by the State, NRC also offered to provide a supply to the local governments.  In addition to providing the initial supply of KI, NRC agreed in September 2006 to provide replenishment of the potassium iodide for those States currently providing it for populations within the 10-mile (EPZs) of commercial nuclear power plants.

OBJECTIVE --- The Contractor shall provide up to 6,321,350 of 65 mg KI tablets produced by an FDA-approved manufacturer, in the quantities and to the locations designated by the NRC Project Officer (PO) during the base year of the period of performance.  If exercised, the Contractor shall provide up to 491,492 additional 65 mg KI tablets during the first option period and up to 8,726,240 additional 65 mg KI tablets during the second option period.

SCOPE OF WORK ---The Contractor shall supply and distribute Potassium Iodide (KI) tablets as ordered by the NRC.

CONFIGURATION OF POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS --- Each 65 mg KI tablet, shall be manufactured by an FDA-approved manufacturer and must be an FDA approved product.  Each tablet shall be scored-in to enable the user to break the tablet into at least four pieces.  Each 65 mg KI tablet shall have the maximum FDA-approved shelf life from date of acceptance by the NRC or the State or Tribe to which delivery was made.  

TASK 1 - SUPPLY POTASSIUM IODIDE TABLETS ---  The contractor shall provide the following amounts of 65 mg KI tablets during the base period and option periods (if exercised):  

Base Period, Minimum 500,000; Maximum 6,321,350.
Option Period 1, Minimum 100,000; Maximum 491,492.
Option Period 2, Minimum 100,000; Maximum 8,726,240.

The NRC is not obligated to order the maximum amount(s) stated herein.

TASK 2 ? DISTRIBUTION --- The contractor shall ship the specified number of KI tablets, to the locations identified in the delivery order (see Attachment 1, for Locations), no later than 90 days from receipt of the delivery order from the NRC PO.  The contractor shall maintain records of the shipping logs, showing quantities sent, receiving organization and proof of delivery.  A copy of these documents shall be provided to the NRC PO no later than five (5) calendar days from the date of delivery.  KI tablets shall be provided in a manner which provides ease of distribution, packaging, and storage; and maintains the shelf-life integrity of the tablets, once provided to the State or Tribe.  As a matter of redistribution and tamper avoidance, individually packaged or blister packaged tablets are the preferred method in packaging the tablets.    

DAMAGED/CRUSHED TABLETS --- The Contractor shall replace, at no cost to the NRC, any tablets that have been damaged or crushed during shipping.  The NRC will provide claims for replacement no later than 45 calendar days after delivery.

SUBMITTAL AND CONFIRMATION OF DELIVERY ORDER --- The NRC PO will e-mail the request for the tablets to the Contractor and follow-up the e-mail request with a telephone call.  The Contractor shall provide an e-mail confirmation to the NRC PO.

BILL-TO AND SHIP-TO ADDRESS REQUIREMENTS --- The Contractor shall ship the tablets to various locations specified by the NRC PO, while maintaining one overall Bill-to Account.

CONTRACTOR POINT OF CONTACT --- The contractor shall designate one primary and one alternate personnel as point of contact.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-16.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with the small business size standard of 500, however, this acquisition is being procured using full and open competition, therefore, any interested vendor may submit a quotation.

This is a brand name or equal requirement.  Brand name or equal description is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive and is to indicate the quality and characteristic of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency?s requirement.

The Manufacturing Metrology Division in MEL is building a vacuum cryogenic probe station for the development and testing of instrumentation for low-temperature atomic break-junction experiments, as part of the Intrinsic Force Standards Competence effort. A key component of the proposed system will be small, cryo-compatible, nano-positioning stages for manipulating and aligning the various sensors in a cryogenic, ultra-high vacuum environment. Space is limited, since the cold portion of the test chamber is restricted to a two inch diameter footprint, so that the working volume available for the stages is around 15 mm x 15 mm x 10 mm.

The system will be used to test prototypes of ultra-sensitive mechanical devices; primarily custom-designed, state-of-the-art force and displacement transducers.  The positioning stages must tolerate long operating cycles (10-12 hours or more) at a stable cryogenic operating temperature (for example, 5 K plus or minus 0.1 K). The position resolution of the stages should be a few tens of nanometers or less. The stages should also have very high position stability (e.g., sub-nanometer) and be able to hold position without consuming power.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for three (3) Cryogenic Positioning Stages.

I17D01   52.217-9C03   OPTIONS FOR INCREASED QUANTITY   (OCT 2001)   DSCC 
(a) The Government may require delivery of additional supplies in accordance with the CLIN(S) identified as Option CLIN(S) in Section B.
(b) The option may be exercised in one or more increments at the time of award and after award during the period of the contract delivery schedule minus 14 days.  The total amount of supplies ordered under this option will not exceed the maximum specified in Section B but may be less than the maximum amount.  A written notice mailed or otherwise furnished by the DSCC contracting officer to the contractor within the time specified shall constitute an exercise of the option.  Delivery schedule is defined as follows:
(1) The delivery schedule means a period of time from the date of award to the last scheduled delivery date of any CLIN, including CLINs added by modification (other than option exercises) as stated in the modification.
(2) Modifications extending the delivery schedule shall be interpreted as extending the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(3) Modifications accelerating the delivery schedule shall NOT be interpreted as reducing the option period, unless otherwise stated in the modification.
(c) Prior to option exercise, the contractor voluntarily may reduce option price or improve delivery time by written notice to the contracting officer.
(d) Delivery of supplies ordered pursuant to this clause shall be required within the same number of days as the original contract quantity, computed from date of option exercise.  However, if First Article Testing is required under the contract and the First Article Test has been waived or passed at time of award of the option, delivery time for option quantities shall be reduced by the amount of time specified for reduction based upon FAT waiver as specified under contract clauses I09D04, DSCC 52.209-9C07 or I09D06, DSCC 52.209-9C11.  If additional time is required for delivery of the option quantity the contractor must submit a written request to the contracting officer within 10 days after receipt of option notice.
(e) If the specifications are changed prior to option exercise or if the option exercise specifies different delivery points or packing requirements other than stated in the contract, the price and delivery time for the option exercise quantity shall be subject to adjustment under the clause entitled "Changes".
(f) The Government may reject an offer as nonresponsive if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the basic requirement and the option quantities.  An offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices significantly less than cost for some work and prices which are significantly overstated for other work.
NOTE:  FAILURE TO SUBMIT AN OFFER ON THE OPTION CLIN(S) IN SECTION B MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF BID/OFFER.

M17A03 FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS
Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government?s best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access inform ation may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial  vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates  will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in ge tting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of equipment utilized to conduct the airfield  survey, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontract ors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at  Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as ap propriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logisti cs Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is termin ated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 st ates:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will o nly be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Acces s Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identi fication badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Ga te Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employ ee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuin g a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee doe s not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any re ason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required  time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or witho ut advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access  identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction  to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or  reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA re gulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect  all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Ac cess Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the insta llation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electroni c mail.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for services that are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The office of NOAA Pacific Island and Area Office located in Honolulu, HI is seeking for a contractor to provide Cook Island and Fiji Sea turtle Conservation Management, Mitigation and Outreach Program. Objective: The 
purpose of the project is to increase the likelihood of survival of sea turtles that are captured during the course of commercial tuna fishing operations in both the Cook Islands and Fiji.  Also to heighten awareness generally to the increased concern of the depressed state of sea turtle populations found in these countries areas under national jurisdiction and the greater western Pacific. The project has three major objectives: 1To expand the current activities of the Cook Island and Fiji marine resources fisheries observer program by increasing the capabilities of agency staff and observers in recognizing, handling, and reporting interactions between sea turtles and the relevant commercial fisheries in Cook Islands and Fiji.2To familiarize commercial fishing operations in Cook Islands and Fiji with techniques of handling sea turtles caught incidentally to fishing operations, and provide appropriate equipment and instructions on how to address specific sea turtle interaction situations.3To integrate the topic of sea turtle interaction with commercial fishing operations into the relevant marine resource agency?s ongoing fisheries management program. This will enable actors in the both the public and private sector to acquire a broader understanding of how to handle sea turtle interactions at sea and to lay the foundation for future fisheries management activities, if required. Beyond these objectives, it is expected that the project will collect baseline information on sea turtle-fisheries interactions, and enhance cooperation between the Cook Islands Ministry of Marine Resources and the Fiji Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, and other relevant government agencies or environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) involved in turtle conservation in these nations. Background: The Pacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO) of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) has supported projects, via grants and contracts, aimed at lessening the adverse consequences of interactions between sea turtles and commercial tuna fisheries in Pacific Island countries. These projects have been aimed at capacity building in government agencies of several Pacific Island countries engaged in marine resources management, and in heightening the awareness of sea turtle bycatch issues in the fishing industry. The focus of the projects has been to provide Pacific Island government fisheries managers and locally based commercial fishers with a broader understanding of the level and consequences of sea turtle interactions with commercial fisheries in the countries concerned, and to increase the likelihood of survival by sea turtles that are captured incidentally during the course of commercial fishing operations. Training of onboard fishery observers in sea turtle release techniques and the use of such observers as a conduit to change attitudes and enhance awareness of sea turtle bycatch issues has been crucial components in each project. Each of the countries participating in these projects to date have an ongoing or developing fisheries observer programs: Federated States of Micronesia (implementation in 2003), Marshall Islands (2003 and 2004), and Papua New Guinea (2004 and 2005), Indonesia (2004-2007), Vietnam (2006-2007) and New Caledonia (2007). Work Elements:The project consists of 5 tasks and report writing.  It shall entail 50 days of in-country work spread between the Cook Islands and Fiji.  For the Cook Islands it may be necessary to travel to Pago Pago American Samoa, given most of the CI high seas fishing fleet (longliners) off load there and some vessels reportedly rarely visit ports in the CI. Work shall consist of a minimum of 4 workshops (2 in each country) for observers where they shall be introduced to the subject of bycatch mitigation and will be trained in appropriate turtle bycatch mitigation techniques and the use of specific mitigation tools. Information shall be provided on the Cook Islands and Fijian turtle resource, with particular attention to those species considered most under threat at the present time. The contractor SHALL:Task 1 Preparation or compilation of instructional materials.  Creation of information shall include but not be limited to the western Pacific turtle identification, de-hooking, handling in the event of hooking, for tuna longline and purse seine vessels.  Provide materials for distribution of vessel operators and crew in Japanese, Korean, Bahasa, Fijian, and English.Task 2   Increasing relevant Marine Resources Staff and Observer Capabilities: Conduct four (4) workshops  (2 per country) of three day duration to include training for fishery observers and industry in the proper handling of sea turtles incidentally hooked or entangled in fishing gear.  During the workshops, a presentation on the importance of reducing turtle interaction from the commercial fishing industry standpoint shall be made. Mitigation devices shall be explained, and instructional materials provided. Videos showing proper mitigation techniques practiced in other longline fisheries shall be shown. Create a training syllabus for use in the training sessions as well as for use in future training sessions to be conducted by senior CI and Fiji marine resources staff, and provide reference documents for use by onboard observers. Provide relevant tools to observers and training for their use on board fishing vessels, focusing on the tuna and shark longline fisheries. The focus of activities shall be with those companies based proximal Rorotonga and Pago Pago for the Cook Islands and Suva and Lavuka for Fiji.  Task 3 Integration of the Topic of Sea Turtle Interaction with Cook Island and Fiji Ongoing Fishery Management Program Review current in-country data collection programs, including purse seine and longline log-sheets and observer data collection forms and the data collection protocols, to determine what, if any, adjustments might be useful for current programs for the purpose of improving turtle related information. Recommend appropriate protocols and arrangements for the sharing of sea turtle interaction information collected by the relevant marine resource agency in each country with regional fishery management and environmental organizations. Hold two (2) one-day workshops for Rorotonga and Suva-based ENGOs to explain interaction mitigation steps being taken by the relevant marine resource management agencies and to present information on the subject. Based on the review of the data detailed above, along with any relevant information from regional organizations, provide a report to the relevant marine resource management agency detailing the extent of sea turtle interaction with commercial fisheries in each respective country. Compare and contrast these results with the results from like projects or sources of information in other Pacific Island Countries or from regional organizations. Task 4 Tuna Industry Outreach: Hold informational meetings as their schedule allows, with vessel agents and operators, explaining the importance of the topic and providing background information on devices and method to mitigate the adverse effects of interactions between sea turtles and commercial fishing in the Cook Islands and Fiji. Meet with tuna longline vessel operators and explain observer tasks and duties relating to sea turtle interaction, and provide appropriate handling and release instructions.  Emphasize the new role of observers in utilizing these techniques and assisting vessel captains where necessary. Provide materials in Japanese, Fijian and Korean for longline vessel captains, and in Bahasa and English for deck bosses or others in positions of authority onboard. Provide the relevant information for any purse seine companies or operations based or operating out of Fiji regarding interactions with FADs or  payao-based fishery. Task 5 Other Activities: Organize a meeting of relevant marine resource management agency staff with ENGOs, including but not be limited to, The Nature Conservancy, the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), and the International Waters Program (IWP) based at the South Pacific Regional Environment Program, University of the South Pacific and the relevant  Departments of environment / conservation to publicize the marine resource management agency?s activities and intentions with regard to sea turtle data collection, conservation, management and interaction mitigation. Establish or ensure a regular channel of communication exists between the marine resource management and environmental agencies in each country, and this can be expanded by encouraging participation of person(s) responsible to attend the workshops ito gain familiarity with the subject matter and project objectives.  As this project will be the first introduction of commercial fishing interests (tuna fishing companies) into the area of turtle bycatch mitigation, the approach should be cooperative and seeking industry?s voluntary participation. NOAA FISHERIES:The NOAA Fisheries will facilitate access by the contactor to the Fijian Ministry of Fisheries and Forests and the Cook Islands Ministry of Marine Resources personnel.  The NOAA Fisheries will request that a Fijian Ministry of Fisheries and Forests and Cook Islands Ministry of Marine Resources representative, ideally one from the relevant observer program accompany the contractor and participate in all industry meetings.
The NOAA Fisheries will provide access to all relevant informational materials developed to date on sea turtle identification, mitigation and handling on longline vessels fishing under domestic authorizations. Deliverable(s): The final work product shall be a report to the PIRO, indicating if each of the Task(s) were fulfilled.   The report will provide copies of all training materials and syllabus developed for the various meetings / workshops detailed above, along with a copy of the report detailed in Task 3.  The Report. An electronic version (MSWord) draft report shall be submitted to the PIRO for review 240 days after the date of initiation of the contract.  The report will be reviewed by the PIRO and returned with written comments or suggested revisions to the contractor within 14 days. The final draft report incorporating the PIRO comments shall be submitted 20 days thereafter. The final report shall be submitted in both hard copy and electronic form (MSWord).  The final report should include such visual aids as are appropriate to illustrate the findings, i.e. maps, figures, tables. The final report shall include endnotes referencing the documents consulted. Timetable: Day 1 Contract begins,Day 240 Interim Report Due.

<DESC>Amendment 0002, June 14, 2007
Subject: NAMA-07-R-0010
Site Visit Q&A

A site visit was conducted today i.a.w the subject RFP, and the following questions and answers were given.
1-Question:  Can you define the fields of the records and define the metadata required for index after capture?
Answer:  NARA?s records are organized based on the agency that created the records. The highest level of the descriptive hierarchy is the Record Group, which are the records of a particular agency. Under a Record Group there are one or more (usually many) Series that define groups of records created by the agency. The next step down in the hierarchy is the File Unit; file unit is flexible and may be a box of records or may be a folder within a box of records. The lowest level in the hierarch is the individual record represented by an Item Level description. Information on this topic is available at - http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/data.html and http://www.archivists.org/catalog/stds99/index.html.

2-Question:  Is there a Minimum descriptive Metadata or higher level data identification?
Answer:  Minimum metadata requirements are addressed in general in NARA?s Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access: Creation of Production Master Files ? Raster Images, June 2004 ? available at http://www.archives.gov/preservation/technical/guidelines.pdf.? Other specific descriptive metadata requirements are addressed in NARA?s Life Cycle Data Requirements Guide, available at http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/lifecycle-data-requirements.doc (see Appendix C of the NARA?s Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Archival Materials for Electronic Access: Creation of Production Master Files ? Raster Images, June 2004 for the minimum or mandatory metadata elements).

3-Question:  Do you digitize Classified documents?
Answer:  No, not in the NWTS Special Media Preservation Labs, all items received for reformatting are unclassified.

4-Question:  You use some auto feed machines, are historically significant documents auto fed, or hand fed?
Answer:  Historically significant materials are all hand fed. 

5- Question: How many servers are currently used?
Answer:  Currently the NWTS Labs manage three network attachable storage servers, expansion will be on a local preservation lab level.  Lab servers are not connected to NARA?s IT network.  The lab plans to add more network attachable storage.  All existing workflows are separate, the goal is to tie the preservation lab work together.  Please reference the RFP.

6- Question: Will Macintosh computers be involved?
Answer: Yes.  Some of the older scanners were Mac only, now we have equipment that is Windows capable, we will continue using both Macintosh and Windows workstations.  All are operational and will be a part of the expansion of our digital system in the preservation laboratory.

7-Question:  Will custom configuration of the workstations be required?
Answer:  We are looking for brand name or equal that meets the minimum requirements already expressed in the RFP.

8- Question:  Is there an expected delivery schedule?
Answer: We are expecting vendors to propose a delivery schedule, and the proposed schedule will be evaluated as part of the technical evaluation.

9-Question: Is there a specification of metadata used for repository storage or long-term management of the digital resources?
Answer:  Please see the RFP referencing Metadata, and referenced on line under Lifecycle data.  (Please see web information in answer number 2 above)

10-Question: Referencing metadata, when is it captured?
Answer:  The point of capture or creation will vary. It is captured depending on the group or record received in the preservation laboratory.  In some cases we may receive metadata from databases or spreadsheets maintained by other department, and we will use it to manage the digitization process and add additional metadata. Also, metadata may be collected at time of conversion or after digitization is completed.

11-Question: Is there a page number for all items to be digitized when metadata is provided from a database?
Answer:  For textual records, individual pages are not tracked in existing databases.

12- Question: Is there a page number on the objects?
Answer:  That depends on the item being reformatted, so the answer is Yes and No. Some records may have page numbers; more often than not, the individual pages are not uniquely identified on the original records. We microfilm or digitize the records in the sequence they are delivered to the laboratories.

13-Question:  In the RFP specification I did not see if you are digitizing two pages at once (with bound volumes) or pages of differing sizes.
Answer:  Actually, the preservation laboratory digitizes every size imaginable, but the majority of work is with letter sized, loose or individual documents.  The documents are not always in a bound format, but we do reformat bound documents that can be up to 20 x 30 inches.  Approximately 90% of the preservation work is small loose leaf paper documents.
The specification in the RFP refers to work stations with changeable devices. 

14- Question:  Does metadata have to be in a specific format when transmitted?
Answer:  Please refer to the RFP which states the formats that will meet the stated requirements.

15-Question:  Does more than one project go on at one time?
Answer:  Yes.  Projects can take years to complete or any smaller unit of time.  Everything depends on the projects or delivered to the lab for reformatting. Also, the labs work on multiple projects at the same time. 

16-Question: Is there any documentation that describes the indexing process in more detail?
Answer: The specification defines the objectives we have in regards to workflow management and indexing, and we are expecting vendors to provide proposal for workflow management and indexing that meet our objectives.
