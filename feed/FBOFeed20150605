<SUBJECT>NSRP ASE Research Announcement
<SOLNBR>NSRP14-01
<CONTACT>Lisa A. Fisher, Contracts Manager, Phone 843.760.3356, Email lisa.fisher@scra.org
<DESC>This is a pre&#8208;solicitation notice for the National Shipbuilding Research Program Advanced Shipbuilding Enterprise (NSRP ASE).  The NSRP ASE Executive Control Board plans to issue a Research Announcement in June 2015 to solicit summary proposals that respond to priorities in the program's Strategic Investment Plan, including areas of particular interest that will be identified in the Research Announcement.<br /><br />Research Announcements (RAs) are general in nature, identifying areas of research interest, disclosing criteria for selecting proposals, and soliciting the participation of all offerors capable of meeting the NSRP ASE objectives.  The flexibility of RAs allows objectives to be stated in general terms of need or interest, as opposed to other solicitations (e.g., Requests for Proposals) which require specific solutions or outcomes. <br /><br />The NSRP ASE program goal is to reduce the cost of building and maintaining U.S. Navy ships. To accomplish this, NSRP ASE is focused on industry&#8208;wide implementation of solutions to common cost drivers and consensus priority issues that exhibit a compelling business case to improve the efficiency of the U.S. shipbuilding and ship repair Industry.  Proposals that incorporate aggressive technology transfer to, and buy&#8208; in by, multiple U.S. shipyards are strongly preferred.  <br />

<DESC>Raptor Helmet Mounted Display &amp; Cueing System&nbsp;(RHMDCS) Initial Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />Solicitation Number: FA8611-WPAFB-HMD, 5 June 2015
<p>I. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes</p>
<p>a) This is an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>b) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for the F-22 Raptor weapon system.</p>
<p>c) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Companies responding to this RFI are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation of this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>d) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>e) Background: As weapon systems have become increasingly complex and aircrews are exposed to extensive amounts of battlespace information, it has become clear that an HMD capability for the warfighter is necessary. Industry has recently made major advances in HMD capabilities for aircrew personnel. The purpose of this RFI is to determine existing and emerging Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) technology solutions that can be used to enhance aircrew warfighting operational capabilities with respect to HMD capabilities, as well as acquire industry feedback relating to the following questions:</p>
<p>i. Draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and System Requirements Document (SRD) are attached to this notice. Please review and provide any comments.</p>
<p>ii. If a demonstration with your system fully integrated into the F-22 Air Combat Simulator (ACS) were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>iii. If a demonstration without full integration into the ACS were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>iv. If a demonstration in the F-22 aircraft were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>v. Would your company be willing to provide helmets for demonstration and/or flight test without cost to the Government?</p>
<p>vi. Please provide any other important factors to consider in regards to a demonstration in either the simulator or the aircraft.</p>
<p>vii. Please provide an estimate of your company's manufacturing capability and how much capacity you expect to have available to meet the required engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and retrofit schedules. The Government anticipates the following equipment requirements:</p>
<p>1. Group A = 190 (On aircraft equipment and software)<br />2. Group B = 190 (Interface equipment between aircraft and helmet components)<br />3. Group C = 342 (Helmet components)</p>
<p>In addition, 7 sets would be required for EMD, to be delivered in 2017. Full rate production (FRP) would require deliveries in 2020-2022.</p>
<p>viii. Based on the information that has been released to industry thus far, what concerns does your company have regarding this potential competition?</p>
<p><br />II. Program Requirements</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for a HMD system are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Color display<br />&bull; Capable of displaying a variety of sensor inputs and customized symbology<br />&bull; Capable of cueing sensors and weapons<br />&bull; Supports display and cueing in all day and night operations<br />&bull; Provides symbology and imagery integration with enhanced night vision systems<br />&bull; Compatible with safe operation of the current USAF escape systems and cockpit accommodations, ex. meets military standard human factors related requirements and provides appropriate disconnects for emergency/normal egress<br />&bull; System can be sustained for projected service life of aircraft <br />&bull; Integrated camera which records external field of view and overlaid HMD imagery <br />&bull; HMD symbology can be easily modified for little or no cost outside of the aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP)<br />&bull; Must not hinder pilot performance during all phases and durations of flights</p>
<p>Additional information is given in the draft SRD&nbsp;that is included with this RFI.</p>
<p>It is critical that respondents include the degree to which they require access to F-22 air vehicle weapons system data rights and the degree to which they have, or are able to obtain air vehicle data rights from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.</p>
<p><br />III. RFI Response.</p>
<p>Part A: Business Information. In response to this RFI, please provide the following business information for your company and for any teaming or joint venture partners:</p>

Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis<br />B2_CVRi1_Production<br />Common Very Low Frequency Receiver Increment 1 (CVR INC 1) <br />AFLCMC/WWZ<br />B-2 System Program Office<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH<br />05 June 2015<br />In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Government is conducting a sources sought synopsis (SSS) for the production of the Common Very Low Frequency Receiver (CVR) system for the B-2 bomber. All interested firms shall submit responses demonstrating their capabilities to produce the requested capability to the primary point of contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. While industry sources are requested to provide full and comprehensive responses to this questionnaire, they are reminded that the information is voluntary, and the Government will not reimburse sources in any way for responses provided. Likewise, a company's participation in the market research via this questionnaire does not obligate the Government to enter into any contractual agreement, either formally or informally, with a company. <br />This sources sought is being issued to conduct market research to assess the ability of potential offerors to produce and support a Very Low Frequency (VLF) system capability for a fleet of 20 B-2 bomber aircraft, within the needed schedule. The B-2 Division at Wright-Patterson AFB OH has requirements to:<br />- Produce and deliver production VLF systems with the following four functional elements:<br />o A VLF terminal/receiver with hardware/software certified by the National Security Agency (NSA) and which integrates with a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) antenna, <br />o A power supply to provide electrical power to the VLF as well as other aircraft communication systems, <br />o A portable time source and corresponding ground station to supply precise time and a communications plan for the aircraft, and <br />o A Human Machine Interface (HMI) to provide VLF system controls and displays. <br />- Produce and deliver production VLF systems that meet stringent B-2 environmental requirements, including nuclear hardening,<br />- Produce and deliver production VLF systems that meet the B-2's severely constrained space, weight, power, and cooling (SWaPC) constraints,<br />- Produce and deliver production VLF systems that meet the above requirements within one year of contract award, <br />- Support the fielded systems with initial spares and repairs for a three year period following contract award, and<br />- Support the activation of an organic depot repair capability.
<p>Information received as a result of this SSS may be used in determining future acquisition strategies and whether this acquisition is a small business set-aside; FAR 52.219-14, Limitation on Subcontracting applies. If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a Small Business Set-Aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. All efforts will be made to identify applicable sources. Note that the Government has funded a development program under a sole source contract to Rockwell Collins (a large business), awarded in Dec 2013, based on its modification and qualification of a pre-existing VLF system, and the Government does not own full re-procurement rights for the Rockwell Collins design.</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT: If your company has the capacity to supply this requirement, please provide a capability statement addressing the following areas:</p>
<p>I. BUSINESS INFORMATION</p>

Does your company have a qualified VLF system that is certified by NSA and meets B-2 requirements for operating environment and SWaPC?<br />2. Does your company's VLF system have sufficient flexibility and unused capacity to support the addition of evolving and new communication capabilities and technologies?</p>
<p>If the answer is "yes", provide evidence of the certification and performance characteristics of the system your company would be potentially offering to satisfy the above requirements.<br />IV. BUSINESS PRACTICES<br />1. For this effort would your company need to subcontract any part of the work? (Yes / No). If yes, identify and briefly describe any necessary subcontracts, including to which functional elements they would apply, who the intended subcontractors would be, and approximately what percentage of small business utilization you would anticipate as a percentage of the total contract value?<br />2. What is the probability that your company will submit a proposal to compete on this requirement if an opportunity existed? <br />If you are a certified distributor for any of the parts listed, please indicate this in the event that any subsequent acquisition qualifies under the Non-Manufacturer Rule. Both small and large businesses are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), EDWOSB).<br />Capabilities package: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales if applicable-and product specifications related to this effort. <br />Responses may be submitted electronically to the following e-mail address: keith.brandner@us.af.mil in a Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat compatible format or mailed to AFLCMC/WWZK POC: Keith Brandner, 2690 Loop Road West WPAFB, OH 45433 to be received no later than 10:00 AM, Eastern Time, 6 July 2015. Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Keith Brandner at Keith.Brandner@us.af.mil.<br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "B2 CVRi1". If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to email.<br />Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response to this Sources Sought synopsis.<br />There is no restriction on who can respond to this SSS; however, if submitting company proprietary information, please be sure it is clearly marked. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information to the maximum extent possible. All submissions become Government Property and will not be returned. The Government shall not be liable for, or suffer any consequential damages, for any proprietary information not properly identified.</p>

<p>1. NOTICE: <br />This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only. It constitutes neither a Request for Proposal nor a Request for Quote. It does not restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This Request for Information IS NOT A SOLICITATION or an expression of intent to issue a solicitation of any kind in the future. It should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than to gain the information requested. Interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information, materials, and/or demonstrations received in response and are in no way obligated to respondents by or for any information received.</p>
<p>2. Background and Scope:<br />The 24 Special Operations Wing is requesting information on Just-In-Time Supply Chain Management Solution with capabilities including but not limited to online end-user ordering, tracking, managing, and delivering equipment for Special Operational Forces.</p>
<p>3. Capability Requirements:<br />The 24th Special Operations Wing (SOW) requires a single-source logistics service to enhance Special Tactics (ST) equipment readiness. This capability, designated Special Tactics Personal Equipment Management System (ST-PEMS), shall be fulfilled with a single-award contract. The contractor shall provide stipulated value-added services to include fitting, warehousing, kitting, just-in-time delivery, supply chain management, and Total Asset Visibility (TAV). The contractor shall provide an E-Commerce platform to receive purchase orders and delivery, supply chain management, and Total Asset Visibility (TAV). The contractor shall sustain inventory portfolios so as to meet the government delivery schedule. The contractor shall comply with government-directed modification of the ST-PEMS template.<br /><br />4. Instructions to Potential Respondents: <br />Interested vendors who desire to participate in this RFI are encouraged to submit responses that can be tied to the objectives in paragraph 3. Interested vendors should also include qualifications and experience with the capabilities and systems listed in paragraph 3 above. Responses should address the following:</p>
<p>a. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements (to include any foreign companies)<br />b. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Note that the NAICS code for this requirement, if applicable to your company's capabilities, should be included in your company's NAICS code listing in SAM. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this action is 315220, size standard $500. Based on the NAICS Code, state whether your company qualifies as a:<br />i.

Provide prospective small business utilization percentages (if the acquisition is not set- aside for small business)<br />c. If you recommend another NAICS code that you feel is more applicable to the prescribed requirement, please identify and indicate your company's qualifications under paragraph b of this section.<br />d. If you cannot meet any of the above requirements please provide an estimated cure/lead time as to when the full solution would be available.</p>
<p>5. Specific information requested:</p>
<p>a. Review current acquisition strategy (attachment 1) and provide suggestions or comments<br />b. Review current Performance Work Statement (attachment 2) and provide suggestions or comments<br />c. Provide responses to government questionnaire (attachment 3)</p>
<p>6. Responses, communications and additional considerations:<br />Companies may be contacted to fully understand the contractor responses. 24 SOW is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for collecting and analyzing information about capabilities within the market to satisfy agency needs. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined, and market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open competition, a small business set-aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is determined to be a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply. Potential sources are encouraged to submit recommended small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value for consideration, in the event the acquisition is not set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability among small business contractors, a key factor in determining if an acquisition will be a small business set-aside is that two or more potential small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the effort, as defined in FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate, and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Large and small businesses should provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value as well as supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>
<p>Information received that is identified as proprietary/sensitive, will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>When submitting a response, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA).</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 20 pages, 12 pt Times New Roman font, single space, and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail on production and sustainment capabilities. Illustrations, charts, graphs, etc. count against the total. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Broad industry participation for this RFI is encouraged. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on Fed Biz Ops (FBO), unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE/REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The United States Army Communications-Electronics Command Software Engineering Center (USACECOM SEC) provides life cycle software solutions and services that enable the warfighting superiority and information dominance across the enterprise. SEC provides systems, software engineering and scientific support for a wide variety of Army and Department of Defense (DoD) customers including Army Program Executive Officers (PEOs) and their Project Managers (PMs), Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA) and its components, and the other Joint Service DoD elements. The ultimate customer and consumer of our products and services is the Warfighter in the field.</p>
<p><br />The USACECOM SEC is conducting an On-Ramp under the Software and Systems Engineering Services Next Generation (SSES NexGen) Multiple Award Task Order (MATO) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contractual vehicle in accordance with contract clause H-11 "On and Off Ramp." SSES NexGen allows Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Cost-Reimbursement, Firm-Fixed-Price and combinations of these types of orders. This action is being undertaken in order to find suitable Small Business (SB) contractors to further populate the Restricted Suite on the existing SSES NexGen. The original Restricted Suite vehicles were awarded May 31, 2013 with a base period of two (2) years, one two (2) year option and one one (1) year option. Each SB contractor was awarded a contract in both the Restricted and Unrestricted Suites.</p>
<p><br />On-Ramp proposals shall be subject to the same proposal instructions and evaluation procedures as the SSES NexGen Request for Proposal (RFP) W15P7T-12-R-C005 dated 01 December 2011 and amendments thereto. Source Selection will be conducted in the same manner as under the original SSES NexGen. Every prime contractor awarded a contract is required to be able to perform any and all work as stated in the PWS at time of award of a task order (TO). The overall security requirement is TOP SECRET Facility Clearance/TOP SECRET Level of Safeguarding for the base IDIQ vehicle. The contractor shall require access to COMSEC information, Secure Compartmental Information (SCI) and Non SCI Intelligence Information, NATO, Foreign Government Information, FOUO information and must be able to access Security/Program Classification Guide(s) (SCGs) and SIPRNET.

Efforts estimated at $8M and below will be set-aside for the Restricted Suite contractors. In order to be determined a small business concern under NAICS 541511, a business must not have more than an average of $27.5 million in annual receipts as defined in 13 C.F.R 121.104. The Government's target is 5 awards.</p>
<p><br />The PWS describes the services and support outcomes that the SEC will provide to these and to other customers. The resulting contract shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision and other items and non-personal services necessary to satisfy the requirements as defined in this PWS. The awardee(s) shall perform to the standards in this contract and follow-on task orders. The contractor(s) working to satisfy the requirements of this PWS will provide engineering and technical services to the USACECOM SEC, its components and their successors.</p>

<a href="mailto:robert.mohn@netl.doe.gov">robert.mohn@netl.doe.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technical Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to TA Instruments-Waters, LLC. NETL/ORD for a thermal conductivity meter with the capability of operating at temperatures between 10oC and 200oC.  The DTC-300 Thermal Conductivity Meter High-Range was the only device found on the market that measures the steady-state thermal conductivity of a material at a range of temperatures (as opposed to obtaining the thermal conductivity of the material by pulsing in thermal energy and measuring the change in the temperature, which is less precise).  The requirement to obtain a precise, steady-state measurement of the thermal conductivity is what makes the purchase unique.  The equipment items being procured are: - DTC-300 Thermal Conductivity Meter High-Range Part # 854030.905 - Chiller Circulator, 13L Reservoir, 120VAC Part # 202612.001 - Vespel Reference (with data) Part # 854131.901 - Vespel Reference (with data) Part # 854132.901 - Vespel Reference (with data) Part # 854152.001 - Heat Transfer Compound Jar Part # 854135.001 - Liquid Cell, 50.8 mm Part # 854101.901 - Paste Cell, 50.8mm Part # 854100.901 - Stack Module, Mid-Range, 0.002-0.02 Part # 854266.901 - Stainless Steel Reference, 50.8 mm Part # 854117.901
This is considered a sole source to TA Instruments because, to the best of the NETL?s knowledge, based on market research conducted there is no other equipment on the market which does a steady-statement measurement of the thermal conductivity and TA Instruments is the only known source that can provide the equipment.   No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:00 PM ET on June 19, 2015.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Robert Mohn, via email at Robert.Mohn@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY<br />NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR SOLICITATION
<p>This is a sources sought to determine the availability and capability of small&nbsp;businesses capable of providing Hazardous Waste for FDA Nationwide including Puerto Rico. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 562112 - Hazardous Waste Collection; Small Business Size Standard is $38.5 Million.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for arranging for proper disposal of chemical, medical pathological, radioactive and mixed wastes generated by the research laboratory activities within FDA facilities nationwide including Puerto Rico. Our laboratory operations include the use and generation of diversified chemical, radioactive, and medical pathological wastes of varying toxicities and quantities.</p>
<p>FDA recognizes its responsibilities to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with existing and proposed regulations imposed upon entities which generate, transport, store, treat, and dispose of hazardous chemical compounds. The Agency acknowledges, however, that the field of hazardous waste disposal services is a dynamic and ever changing industry, which is significantly impacted by State and Federal regulations and by the influx of new technological advancements. It is therefore mandatory that the successful Contractor demonstrate a high level of competence and technical expertise comparable to that obtained through extensive experience and aggressive willingness to comply with applicable hazardous waste management regulations.</p>
<p>To fully support this task the Contractor shall provide necessary full time employees with the applicable credentials to support environmental services for the FDA service locations.</p>

<p>&bull; If applicable, identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and SINs that are applicable to this requirement;</p>
<p>&bull; If a large business, identify the subcontracting opportunities that would exist for small business concerns; and</p>
<p>&bull; Though this is not a request for quote, informational pricing is encouraged.</p>

<p>Notice of Intent:<br />Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not any future requirement similar to this one should be set aside for small business, made available to full and open competition or procure through sole-source acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes:<br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE FOR 20 Hermes Model 80 Precision Flask Package (PFP) 
<SOLNBR>NRMJ10001501006mec
<RESPDATE>061215
<CONTACT>Mark Caban, Contract Specialist, Phone 303-497-6875, Email mark.caban@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure 20 "Hermes Model 80 Precision Flask Packages (PFP)" manufactured by High Precision Devices, Inc., Boulder, Colorado for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Atmospheric Research, on a sole source basis, in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), One Responsible Source. Using FAR Part 12, (Acquisition of Commercial Items) procedures the Government intends to negotiate a contract with High Precision Devices, Inc. for the "Hermes Model 80 Precision Flask Package (PFP)".
<p>The Earth System Research Laboratory's Global Monitoring Division (GMD) requires portable, programmable 12-flask air sampling packages for collection of atmospheric samples from ground sites (fixed and vehicular), tall tower sites, and aircraft. These samples will be used to make high-precision, laboratory measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, SF6, 13C and 18O in CO2, 13C in CH4, 14C in CO2, and a suite of approximately 40 halocompounds and volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p>GMD requires these programmable 12-flask air sampling packages to carry out its scientific program of very accurate and precise, long-term measurements of greenhouse gases and other trace atmospheric species from a network of sites in North America (the Carbon Observation and Analysis System; COAS, and integral component of the North American Carbon Program). The purpose of this program is to study the variation of greenhouse gases with height and location, which will enable GMD and other scientists to better quantify the North American terrestrial biosphere's uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Quantifying the North American carbon budget and identifying implications for the global carbon cycle are priority items outlined in the U.S. Climate Change Science Program Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>GMD is currently already using a set of approximately 200 Programmable Flask Packages (PFPs) that were designed at NOAA to specifically meet the stringent requirements of accuracy and precision related to the measurements of the compounds of scientific interest (the compounds noted above). These packages were also designed to interface with our existing logistical software and hardware and a group of trace gas analysis systems.</p>
<p>The programmable 12-flask air sampling package that is required must be fully compatible with the current packages being used by GMD. The serial communications protocols must be fully compatible with the existing GMD analyses systems, and the air handling interconnections must be fully compatible with GMDs air sampling and measurement equipment and logistical infrastructure.  The packages must be built with parts approved by the Federal Aviation Administration for use on aircraft.  The materials used in the sample path through the package must not alter the ambient concentrations of the species of scientific interest (listed above) in the atmospheric samples to be collected and stored in the package for later measurement.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for equipment for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may provide written notification to the Contract Specialist requesting a copy of the solicitation and all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 423490 Other Professional Equipment and supplies Merchant Wholesalers and the small-business size standard is 100 employees.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Mark Caban at mark.caban@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>All vendors doing business with the Government are required to be registered at SAM.gov.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando, FL intends to sole source the upgrade and modification of existing F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircrew training system software to support the aircraft System Configuration Set (SCS)/Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) development to L-3 Communications Corporation, Link Simulation  and  Training Division (L-3), Arlington, TX under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement includes incorporation of modifications of existing L-3 software to provide H14 and H16 SCS functionality, the associated aircraft ECPs and major subsystems identified in the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft development roadmap.
  L-3 is the only source which possesses the required source data and training media baseline information necessary to update and deliver the L-3 developed software.  In order to comply with PGI 206.301-1 the Government is seeking information on the availability of potential comparable sources to provide the ability to upgrade existing L-3 software.  Responses to this sources sought will be utilized to ensure no comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE

This effort involves the following training systems:

-Tactical Operational Flight Trainer 125, located at Naval Weapons Station (NWS) China Lake, CA

-Advanced Development Stations located at NWS China Lake, CA; Arlington, TX; and St Louis, MO.

DISCLAIMER

THIS SOURCE SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND

This requirement includes incorporation of modifications of existing L-3 software to provide H14 and H16 SCS functionality, the associated aircraft ECPs and major subsystems identified in the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft development roadmap.
  The software will only be incorporated on TOFT 125 located at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) and on Advanced Development Stations (ADS) located at NAWCWD China Lake, CA; Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD; Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL; L3 Link, Arlington, TX; and Boeing, St. Louis, MO.  The contract will also provide for directed procurement by Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers for the acquisition of modifications of existing L-3 software for FMS versions of H14 and H16 SCS software.  Logistic support, comprised of support equipment, technical manual updates and on-site training will also be included.
  Any new modifications and upgrades must be integrated and interoperable with the currently fielded F/A-18E/F and EA-18G systems and require the use of technical information that is not readily available to other contractors during design and development as the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor. Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current trainer design, award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18 and EA-18G aircraft requirements.  A competitive acquisition would allow for a new TOFT software baseline to be introduced that may not be integrated and interoperable with the existing TOFTs due to the restricted rights and limited data rights that resulted from a competitive award under the Training System Contract (TSC) I multiple award contract at NAWCTSD.
  This would require the Government to have two infrastructures in place for TOFT life cycle support or would require a significant rework of the current TOFT design and development that would cost the Government additional non-recurring engineering (NRE) effort for first article development, testing, and retrofit of existing TOFTs.  As the current designer, developer, integrator, manufacturer and supplier of a substantial share of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G TOFT hardware and software components, only L-3 possesses the requisite knowledge, engineering expertise, and data rights of the design required to design, build, modify, upgrade and deliver modifications to the existing L-3 F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircrew training system software to maximize both TOFT 125 and the five ADS capabilities as developmental assets for the aircraft H14 and H16 SCS programs.
 

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

The Government requires the design, development, integration, installation, and test expertise to update existing L-3 developed aircrew training systems software, design data, and provide logistics support to meet the Government requirements to support the aircraft H14 and H16 SCS programs.  

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Any resultant contract is anticipated to have a security classification level of SECRET.  Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metals restriction of the Berry Amendment in accordance with DFARS clauses 225.7003 and 252.225-7009, inclusive of Class Deviations 2008-O0002, unless an exception applies.

ELIGIBILITY

The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 333318 (Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing).
 The Product Service Code (PSC) is 6910 (Training Aids).

SUBMISSION DETAILS

This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice to determine if a comparable source exists and outline the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with L-3.  Interested sources shall submit their written technical capabilities to provide the supplies described above.  Written response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size, and Points of Contact including name, phone number, fax number, and e-mail address. Detailed written capabilities must be submitted by email to Ricardo Elias (Ricardo.L.Elias@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2007, no later than 1 PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Friday, 12 June 2015.
 All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. Verbal submissions via phone will not be honored. Information and materials submitted in response to this request WILL NOT be returned. Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed novel methods for particle contamination mitigation. The methods were developed for exploration of surfaces such as Moon, Mars, and asteroids. During past missions, lunar dust caused an array of issues including compromised seals, clogged filters, abraded visors and space suit surfaces, and was a significant health concern. NASAs novel methods for particle contamination mitigation include both controlled chemical and topographical modifications. These methods offer a wealth of applications and commercial opportunities. The benefits include films, coatings, and surface treatments with antifouling, dust resistance, hydrophobic to superhydrophic, low adhesion/friction, and self-cleaning characteristics. NASA is seeking development partners. NASAs novel methods include both controlled chemical and topographical modifications. The methods available for further development are novel copolyimide oxetanes and modified surface energy via laser ablative surface patterning. Two methods can be used individually or in combination to generate superhydrophobic surfaces.  The first method is the synthesis of a polyimide coating or film with a modified surface chemistry. A minor amount of an oxetane reactant containing fluorine is added to the polyimide, and the oxetane preferentially migrates to the surface, enabling relatively high concentrations of fluorine at the surface, without compromising the functional performance of the bulk of the polymide coating/film. The copolymers exhibit mitigation of particle adhesion and fouling from exposure to various particulate and biological contaminants and exhibit reduced surface energy and increased surface fluorine content at extremely low oxetane loadings relative to the imide matrix. Additionally, the short fluorinated carbon chains do not bioaccumulate, reducing the environmental impact of these materials. The second method is the modification of the surface energy of the substrate via laser ablative surface patterning. With this method, a laser creates nanoscale patterns in the surface of a material to increase the hydrophobicity of the surface. The benefits of hydrophobic surfaces include decreases in friction and increases in self-cleaning properties. This is an advantageous method of surface modification because it is fast and single-step, promises to be scalable, requires no chemicals, could be applied to a variety of materials, and does not require a planar surface for patterning. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<CONTACT>richard.pecoraro, 7034286485

<a href="mailto:richard.j.pecoraro@usace.army.mil">USACE HEC, Ft. Belvoir</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a Sole-Source, Firm-Fixed-Price Type Professional Services contract to The Center for Research on the Changing Earth System (CRCES), to conduct a study and submit quantifiable data by combining decadal climate, hydrology, and crop data with USACE data and GIS based models to test the idea that decadal climate variability influences USACE budgeting and planning processes, geo-spatially and temporally. This requirement in not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The following are the major tasks associated with this study: <br>  <br> 1.Foundational Questions Portion of the Study: <br>  <br> Four initial questions about the combinations are of value for USACE operations and budget planners:  <br> 1.	The first question is there a higher probability some combinations occur than other combinations.   <br> 2.	Can the persistence of each combination be quantified?  Finally can any information be provided regarding the probability of moving from one combination to another combination?   <br> 3.	Are there certain transition sequences that have a low probability of occurring?   <br> 4.	Conversely are the transition sequences that have a high probability of occurrence?  <br> It is understood that the answers to the above questions maybe limited at this point.  The goal here is to document the state of current knowledge and identify, should there be a follow on phase of this project, what work needs to be done to refine this understanding of these relationships to best support USACE planning and budgeting. <br>  <br> 2.Contiguous United States Analytical Portion of the Study: <br>  <br> The only analysis covering the entire contiguous United States in this contract will be an analysis of the precipitation patterns by USACE Division by decadal combination relative to historic precipitation for each division.  The intention is to do a limited analysis intended to identify how precipitation patterns differ by decadal combination by division relative to the historic precipitation pattern.   Contractor will be responsible for providing precipitation data. <br>  <br> 3.The Mississippi River Basin Portion of the Analysis: <br>  <br> The next task in the contract will be to analyze how decadal variability influences USACE missions and budget processes for the divisions associated with the Mississippi River Basin (http://www.usace.army.mil/Locations.aspx).  The impacts to be considered include: <br> a.	Crop production, <br> b.	Reservoir levels, <br> c.	Inland waterway dredging, <br> The source of decadal oscillation data for the PDO, WPWP and TAG will be similar to the sources and methods for characterization described in the recent peer reviewed paper by Mehta, Rosenberg and Mendoza, 2012.  <br>  <br> The decadal climate information will be integrated into the Water Information System Data manager (WISDM) Geo-spatial Budget planning tool to describe relationships, if any, between decadal climate patterns and USACE budget and planning processes.  Three tasks will be completed to achieve this:   <br> The contractor is responsible for producing the climate data described above and the modification of the reservoir, dredging, and crop production to ensure the climate data can be effectively linked to the WISDM integrated watershed budget planning tool.  <br> 4.Average crop yield/acre and production by districts of a division within the Mississippi river basin:  <br>  <br> The average crop yield and average crop production for corn wheat and soybean will be calculated as weighted average of the districts within a division that lie within the Mississippi River basin.  The crop data time series to be considered will 1934-2014.   <br> The data will be geo-spatially referenced using the GIS reference grid. <br> The averages will be calculated for each combination and for the historic average yield per acre and average total production.  The combinations are the 8 combinations described in Table 1. The data for the crop yields will be obtained from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS).  The crop yields will need to be adjusted for technological change to ensure yield variation reflects climate variability.  <br>  <br> 5.Impacts on USACE Reservoirs:  <br>  <br> The average water available under each of the eight possible combinations of decadal phase by driver listed in Table 1 will be compared to historic average availability for Reservoir levels in the USACE reservoirs in the Mississippi River Basin.  In this case the analysis will be done by district. <br> The water data will be obtained from USACE sources (Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) and the relevant districts).   <br>  <br> 6.Dredging:  <br>  <br> The average number of cubic yards of dredging activity by decadal combination by district.  In addition, the river flow at St Louis gage should be analyzed by decadal combination.  Low river flows are associated with increased dredging on the Middle Mississippi River.  If there are any anomalies in the data Rolf Olsen and Harvey Hill will facilitate clarification between the data experts and the contractor. The technology trend for this data is discrete rather than the continuous trend observed with crop yields.  Some form of technology de-trending will have to be considered as the dredging technology and consequent dredged volumes differ over the historic record. A proxy for dredging if required could be river flow at other relevant gages.  IWR will provide the dredging data.  The source of the data for the dredging is the Navigation Data Center (http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/).   <br>  <br> 7.Deliverables: <br>  <br> 1.	A table ranking (highest probability to lowest)of combinations occurrence , <br> 2.	A quantification of the persistence of each combination.  Persistence being the number of years a combination is sequentially maintained, <br> 3.	A quantification of: <br> a.	The probability of moving from one combination to another combination,   <br> b.	The combination transition sequences that have a low probability of occurring,   <br> c.	The combination transition sequences that have a high probability of occurrence, <br> 4.	A quantification of the relative changes in average precipitation by USACE division by combination relative to historic precipitation, <br> 5.	A quantification of the average crop yield/acre and production by districts of a division within the Mississippi river basin.  Secondly the calculation of the weighted average of the relevant districts in a division by combination relative to the historic average for the same districts.  The three crops to be considered are non-irrigated wheat, soybean, and corn.  <br> 6.	Quantify and document the difference between normal reservoir operating levels and actual for the month of August by combination and average annual water release by combination versus the historic average. <br> 7.	The de-trended average volume of material dredged by combination versus de-trended dredging over the historic record. The data associated with each phase combination described above will be provided in a format that can be entered into the WISDM tool for the comparison of the activities described in the preceding section. Show the river flow at St Louis gage associated with each phase combination.   <br>  <br> Timeline: <br> 1.	Contract begins, <br> 2.	Delineation of the years related to each combination and probabilities associated with transition,   30 days following Notice to Proceed (NTP). <br> 3.	Crop Production completed 60 days following NTP. <br> 4.	Impacts on USACE related reservoirs and river systems completed 90 days following NTP. <br> 5.	Dredging completed 120 days following NTP. <br> 6.	Final report 135 days following NTP. <br>  <br>  <br> This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price type contract to The Center for Research on the Changing Earth System (CRCES). These services will be provided to the Institute for Water Resources, Alexandria, VA. Point of Contact for this requirement is Mr. Richard J.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a Sole-Source, Firm-Fixed-Price Type Professional Services contract to Dr. Vikram Mehta at The Center for Research on the Changing Earth System (CRCES), to conduct a study and submit quantifiable data by combining decadal climate, hydrology, and crop data with USACE data and GIS based models to test the idea that decadal climate variability influences USACE budgeting and planning processes, geo-spatially and temporally. This requirement in not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The following are the major tasks associated with this study:
<p>1. Foundational Questions Portion of the Study:<br /><br />Four initial questions about the combinations are of value for USACE operations and budget planners: <br />1. The first question is there a higher probability some combinations occur than other combinations. <br />2. Can the persistence of each combination be quantified? Finally can any information be provided regarding the probability of moving from one combination to another combination? <br />3. Are there certain transition sequences that have a low probability of occurring? <br />4. Conversely are the transition sequences that have a high probability of occurrence? <br />It is understood that the answers to the above questions maybe limited at this point. The goal here is to document the state of current knowledge and identify, should there be a follow on phase of this project, what work needs to be done to refine this understanding of these relationships to best support USACE planning and budgeting.</p>
<p>2. Contiguous United States Analytical Portion of the Study:<br /><br />The only analysis covering the entire contiguous United States in this contract will be an analysis of the precipitation patterns by USACE Division by decadal combination relative to historic precipitation for each division. The intention is to do a limited analysis intended to identify how precipitation patterns differ by decadal combination by division relative to the historic precipitation pattern. Contractor will be responsible for providing precipitation data.</p>
<p>3. The Mississippi River Basin Portion of the Analysis:<br /><br />The next task in the contract will be to analyze how decadal variability influences USACE missions and budget processes for the divisions associated with the Mississippi River Basin (http://www.usace.army.mil/Locations.aspx). The impacts to be considered include:<br />a. Crop production,<br />b. Reservoir levels,<br />c. Inland waterway dredging,<br />The source of decadal oscillation data for the PDO, WPWP and TAG will be similar to the sources and methods for characterization described in the recent peer reviewed paper by Mehta, Rosenberg and Mendoza, 2012.</p>
<p>The decadal climate information will be integrated into the Water Information System Data manager (WISDM) Geo-spatial Budget planning tool to describe relationships, if any, between decadal climate patterns and USACE budget and planning processes. Three tasks will be completed to achieve this: <br />The contractor is responsible for producing the climate data described above and the modification of the reservoir, dredging, and crop production to ensure the climate data can be effectively linked to the WISDM integrated watershed budget planning tool. <br /><br />4. Average crop yield/acre and production by districts of a division within the Mississippi river basin: <br /><br />The average crop yield and average crop production for corn wheat and soybean will be calculated as weighted average of the districts within a division that lie within the Mississippi River basin. The crop data time series to be considered will 1934-2014. <br />The data will be geo-spatially referenced using the GIS reference grid.<br />The averages will be calculated for each combination and for the historic average yield per acre and average total production. The combinations are the 8 combinations described in Table 1. The data for the crop yields will be obtained from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS). The crop yields will need to be adjusted for technological change to ensure yield variation reflects climate variability.</p>
<p>5. Impacts on USACE Reservoirs: <br /><br />The average water available under each of the eight possible combinations of decadal phase by driver listed in Table 1 will be compared to historic average availability for Reservoir levels in the USACE reservoirs in the Mississippi River Basin. In this case the analysis will be done by district.<br />The water data will be obtained from USACE sources (Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC) and the relevant districts).</p>
<p>6. Dredging: <br /><br />The average number of cubic yards of dredging activity by decadal combination by district. In addition, the river flow at St Louis gage should be analyzed by decadal combination. Low river flows are associated with increased dredging on the Middle Mississippi River. If there are any anomalies in the data Rolf Olsen and Harvey Hill will facilitate clarification between the data experts and the contractor. The technology trend for this data is discrete rather than the continuous trend observed with crop yields. Some form of technology de-trending will have to be considered as the dredging technology and consequent dredged volumes differ over the historic record. A proxy for dredging if required could be river flow at other relevant gages. IWR will provide the dredging data. The source of the data for the dredging is the Navigation Data Center (http://www.navigationdatacenter.us/). <br /><br />7.Deliverables:<br /><br />1. A table ranking (highest probability to lowest)of combinations occurrence ,<br />2. A quantification of the persistence of each combination. Persistence being the number of years a combination is sequentially maintained,<br />3. A quantification of:<br />a. The probability of moving from one combination to another combination, <br />b. The combination transition sequences that have a low probability of occurring, <br />c. The combination transition sequences that have a high probability of occurrence,<br />4. A quantification of the relative changes in average precipitation by USACE division by combination relative to historic precipitation,<br />5. A quantification of the average crop yield/acre and production by districts of a division within the Mississippi river basin. Secondly the calculation of the weighted average of the relevant districts in a division by combination relative to the historic average for the same districts. The three crops to be considered are non-irrigated wheat, soybean, and corn. <br />6. Quantify and document the difference between normal reservoir operating levels and actual for the month of August by combination and average annual water release by combination versus the historic average.<br />7. The de-trended average volume of material dredged by combination versus de-trended dredging over the historic record. The data associated with each phase combination described above will be provided in a format that can be entered into the WISDM tool for the comparison of the activities described in the preceding section. Show the river flow at St Louis gage associated with each phase combination.</p>
<p>Timeline:<br />1. Contract begins,<br />2. Delineation of the years related to each combination and probabilities associated with transition, 30 days following Notice to Proceed (NTP).<br />3. Crop Production completed 60 days following NTP.<br />4. Impacts on USACE related reservoirs and river systems completed 90 days following NTP.<br />5. Dredging completed 120 days following NTP.<br />6. Final report 135 days following NTP.</p>
<p><br />This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation: No. N02RC52591-24 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-80 (March 2015) simplified procedures for commercial items.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System code is 334513 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>I. Description of Requirement</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis has a multifaceted research program integrating basic, translational, clinical, and population research, with a major focus on common and lethal human cancers that include tumors of the breast, colon, esophagus, liver, lung, pancreas and prostate. LHC studies utilize a Precision Medicine Strategy. LHC main objectives are to conduct investigations that assess: (1) Mechanisms of carcinogenesis including the cellular functions of cancer driving genes; (2) experimental approaches in biological systems for the extrapolation of carcinogenesis data and mechanisms from in vitro models and experimental animals to humans; (3) molecular integrative epidemiology of human cancer risk; and (4) cancer biomarkers of diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic outcome.</p>
<p>The laboratory consists of five sections; the Liver Carcinogenesis Section (LCS), the Molecular Genetics and Carcinogenesis Section (MGCS), the Molecular Epidemiology Section (MES), the Pancreatic Cancer Unit (PCU) and the Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Unit (IMEU). Scientifically, the emphasis is on the role of inherited or acquired host factors as important determinants of an individual's cancer susceptibility and outcomes. The NCI investigations of host factors include interspecies studies among laboratory animals and humans, and are multidisciplinary to include molecular and cellular biology, pathology, epidemiology and clinical investigation. The MGCS devotes their major efforts to precision medicine studies of lung and colon cancer, including fundamental and mechanistic studies. The LCS focuses mainly on dissecting tumor heterogeneity of liver cancer to improve outcome among diverse populations and identifying cancer drivers through integrated genomics. The MES mainly conducts integrative molecular epidemiology studies of prostate cancer and breast cancer with a special emphasis on health disparity and utilizes epidemiological and translational research strategies to identify risk factors and pathways that influence tumor development and progression. The PCU conducts integrative molecular epidemiology studies of pancreatic cancer and utilizes epidemiological and translational research strategies to identify risk factors and pathways that influence tumor development and progression. The IMEU uses an integrative and translational approach to study the genetics and biology behind health disparities in lung cancer and the effect of environmental exposures linked to lung cancer on RNA biology.</p>
<p>The overall goal of LHC is to acquire knowledge that will improve cancer prevention, early detection, stratification and effective treatment.</p>
<p>The government's minimal needs for the automated liquid handling system are the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The robot handler needs to be fit into a laminar flow hood which will prevent the potential of the staff members working with the material to become exposed in the event of a spill or being exposed to the aerosols formed when pipetting human samples</p>
<p>&bull; A light curtain that ensures maximum operator safety by automatically shutting down the robot should a person put their arm into the hood is a necessary feature.</p>
<p>&bull; The robot handler should specifically match up and assist the experimental protocol of samples being analyzed by a mass spectrophotometer. The samples being analyzed by the mass spectrophotometer need to be prepared in a certain set up. A two deck layout would be optimal</p>
<p>&bull; The software that is affiliated with the machine should be easily integrated with the data from the NCI's projects</p>
<p>&bull; The software should support predefined pipetting techniques that include low volume pipetting controls, taking into account the variability in viscosity/surface tension from one reagent/solvent to another</p>
<p>&bull; The software should include user accounts and permissions software to allow separate access by different users, and securing methods to prevent their deletion, modification or other changes</p>
<p>&bull; The system should allow differential access for a variety of users, ranging from full editor status (writing and editing theirs and others protocols), to user-only (only able to run protocols) to per-project access (able to run or edit their own protocols)</p>
<p>&bull; The system should have the option to define instrument access and methods that are password-protected</p>
<p>&bull; The system should contain a graphical interface displaying the deck layout at the start of the run to confirm proper placement of labware prior to running the method. This is essential to preventing a crash between the pipetting hardware and labware that has not been accounted for.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must contains the ability to view the method run using the software simulator to allow visualization of the process before it is run with actual reagents.</p>
<p>&bull; The software must have the capability to send error message or process completion messages via the network to the user's email address or pager system</p>
<p>&bull; The system software must provide the ability to easily and optimally transfer liquids between various microplate formats through the use of pre-defined pipetting techniques</p>
<p>&bull; Equipment must have adaptable plate formats and volumes as research and methods needs change, evolve, and advance</p>
<p>&bull; Many projects within the LHC are based on studies investigating expression levels of RNA and/or DNA in human patient population studies. A necessary characteristics is that it has been made compatible and efficient with the Solid Phase Reversible (SPRI) Nucleic Acid Preparation solutions, so it can isolate RNA and DNA in a high throughput manner with a compatible system that allows for fast, efficient and consistent results</p>
<p>II. Delivery: Contractor shall deliver the item(s) within 30 days after award to: NIH/NCI Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The Contractor that receives the award will be provided with the complete mailing address and point of contact. Upon award, contractor must notify the NCI Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to schedule the delivery.</p>
<p>III. Payment: Payment shall be made after delivery and acceptance of the COR. Payment authorization requires submission and approval of invoice to the NCI COR and NIH Commercial Accounts.</p>

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. ORIGIN (FEB 2006); Naval Operational Logistics Support Center (NOLSC) Ready-To-Ship Notice Vendor Directions will be included in any resultant purchase order. The government, through NOLSC, will arrange and pay for transportation. <BR> <BR>System for Award Management Alternate A 	MAY 2013 <BR> <BR>Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports 	JUN 2012 <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
    (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

    (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

    (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:
      (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
      (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.
      (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
    (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
  (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.<br />(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and<br />(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).<br />(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.<br />(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>
<p>52.249-1 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT<br />The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the Government's interest. If this contract is terminated, the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, including compensation to the Contractor, shall be in accordance with Part 49 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers for 85071<br />Question: <br />I am reaching out to you in hopes you can clarify the statement of work in connection with the above referenced solicitation. Will all 2,637 paraffin blocks be available in a single shipment in July? Alternatively, will the blocks arrive sporadically over a longer period of time? Our lab is located in Frederick, MD: within your 200-mile radius (but on the outer edges) and having to courier completed materials on multiple occasions would likely preclude our involvement. Please advise accordingly.<br />Answer:<br />We were planning to send all of the blocks in a single shipment, not in multiple shipments over a longer period of time.<br />

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Interested Offerors should submit any questions concerning the solicitation at the earliest time possible to enable the Government to respond. Questions shall be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' button. Questions not received prior to 12 June 2015, 11:00 EST will not be considered. <BR> <BR>The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 333924 with the related size standard of 750 employees. The Offeror shall be actively registered with that NAICS or a similar NAICS with the appropriate size standard prior to Award to be considered for any resulting contract. Failure to be properly registered under the appropriate size standard during evaluation and/or at the time of award deems the offer ineligible for award. A similar NAICS Code with the appropriate size standard other than the NAICS Code identified in this buy term may be used as a factor to determine technical capability. (Size standards do not apply to unrestricted set-aside solicitation/RFQ). <BR> <BR>The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Technical and Price.  

Quotations will be evaluated as follows:

I)  Technical

	The Technical evaluation factor is more important than the Price Proposal evaluation factor.

I.	TECHNICAL

The Government will evaluate each vendors Written Technical submission acceptable (pass) or unacceptable (fail).  

1.  Technical Acceptability - Technical acceptability will be determined based on an evaluation of the vendors technical submission.

Written Technical Submittal:
Pass (P):  Technical submission demonstrates that the information quoted meets the Governments requirements as set forth in this Request for Quote.
  
Fail (F):  Failing to provide any of the technical information and/or providing unclear or inadequate information proposed that does not meet the Governments requirements.

Note: If the Contracting Officer determines that a vendors Written Technical Submission is unacceptable, that vendors entire submittal may be determined to be technically unacceptable and may no longer be considered for further competition or award.

II.	PRICE

The vendors proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to:  

     a.  Price comparison with other offerors;
     b.  Comparison with independent Government cost estimates.

Vendors responding to this solicitation are advised that, prior to award, the government may request vendors to submit information/data to support price reasonableness such as copies of paid invoices for the same or similar items, sales history for the same or similar items, price list with effective date and/or copies of catalog pages along with any applicable discounts.
  Failure to submit the requested information may result in disqualification of the submitted quote.  

Establishment of a competitive range is not anticipated; however, the Government reserves the right to establish a competitive range if determined by the Procuring Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the Government.

SELECTION

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106.  The Government shall select the vendor whose quote represents the best value to the Government, considering price and technical when compared to other quotations.  The Government also reserves the right to not award a contract if a contract award is not in the best interest of the Government.
 

(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

(End of provision)

This announcement will close at 11:00 a.m. EST (noon) on Monday, June 8, 2015.

- The past performance evaluation results in an assessment of the respondents probability of meeting the solicitation requirements.
 The past performance evaluation considers each respondents demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet the contracts requirements. One performance confidence assessment rating is assigned for each respondent after evaluating the respondents recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements. There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate the respondents past performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the respondent is to the effort to be acquired. The second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor performed on the contracts.
 The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review this past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.
- Price evaluation will document fairness and reasonableness. Price submissions that do not support the non-price submission may be downgraded.

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. ORIGIN (FEB 2006); Naval Operational Logistics Support Center (NOLSC) Ready-To-Ship Notice Vendor Directions will be included in any resultant purchase order. The government, through NOLSC, will arrange and pay for transportation. <BR> <BR>System for Award Management Alternate A 	MAY 2013 <BR> <BR>Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports 	JUN 2012 <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions.

<DESC><p>Afloat Maintenance for Navy Watercraft (INLS/MPF UB/LCM8) and Related Navy Equipment aboard Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS) OCONUS</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number is M67004-15-Q-1048 and is issued as a Request For Quotes (RFQ), unless otherwise indicated herein. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-82.</p>
<p>This acquisition is Unrestricted with a HubZone Price Evaluation.</p>
<p>The Product Service Code is J019, Maintenance, Repair, Modification, Rebuilding and Installation of Equipment Related to Ships.</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 488390 (Other support activities for water transportation).</p>
<p>The period of performance for the resultant Basic Ordering Agreements will be five (5) Years or $1,000,000.00; whichever occurs first.</p>
<p><br />The Basic Ordering Agreement is for a five (5) year period or a monetary limitation not to exceed $1,000,000.00. Multiple task orders and job orders are anticipated under this BOA. Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such obligation.<br />Firms that demonstrate that they meet the required technical capability qualifications and have satisfactory prior experience/past performance performing repairs on the above mentioned systems will be considered for issuance of a BOA. A maximum of three (3) BOAs may be issued to the most qualified firms for the requirement listed herein.<br />Under this Afloat Repair Program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on task orders for all requirements. If adequate competition cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non-BOA holders.</p>
<p>The tasks of this BOA will be focused and within the scope of the following services: OCONUS Repair and Logistic Services of Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS); Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM-8); Amphibious Bulk Liquid Transfer System (ABLTS) and the Maritime Prepositioned Force Utility Boat (MPF UB); and Repair to take place on watercraft embarked on MPF shipping, deployed overseas.</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor shall provide all required personnel, transportation, supervision (including safety oversight), and other items necessary to perform the required services in an OCONUS and afloat environment subject to MPF shipping schedules.

Currently these systems and their predecessors are maintained by a contractor or subcontractor under contract to the NAVFAC Expeditionary Programs Office (NEPO) while embarked on ships forward deployed. Preventive maintenance will still be conducted under the NEPO contract. This BOA is for corrective maintenance and logistic support.</p>

<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS."

Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<DESC>------UPDATE-------6/5/2015--------------------------------------------------- <br>  <br> Industry Day Program Update Presentation Slides Posted as Attachment to this Notice. <br>  <br> POC:  Jason Holden, Contract Specialist, 407-208-3312 or jason.n.holden.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br>  <br> --------end------------------ <br>  <br>  <br>    <br>  ------Industry Update for LCPM-----------UPDATED 5/29/2015-----------------------  <br>    <br>  Program Title:  Life Cycle Product-line Management (LCPM) - formerly the Range Instrumentation Lifecycle Management (RILM) contract  <br>    <br>  Contracts Evolution: In addition to the name change from RILM to LCPM, the scope has changed from its inception as a contract vehicle for predominantly life cycle management of PM Digital Training (DT) programs into a PM TRADE wide and other organizations contract vehicle encompassing a diverse array of live training programs handling life cycle management as well as Product Line (P/L) development.  The contract ceiling is estimated to be approximately $400M.  <br>    <br>  Introduction & Requirement Summary:  The LCPM contract will enable PM TRADE and other organizations that utilize the Live Training Transformation (LT2) P/L to perform life-cycle management and analysis to include: obsolescence management, Continuous Tech Refresh (CTR), technology insertion, concurrency, upgrades, and disposal of existing training systems and fielding systems to sites that are not currently instrumented.  The LCPM contract scope will encompass the development, implementation, and management of the LT2 Hardware P/L (HPL) in support of PM TRADE's goals of:  <br>    <br>  -Reducing Operational Cost & Complexity   <br>  -Aligning & Supporting Product Development (common standards, interfaces, etc.)  <br>  -Enhancing Soldier Training Effectiveness  <br>  -Reducing Sustainment & Development Costs  <br>  -Increasing Technology Agility  <br>  -Leverage other Army systems and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) technologies, and align to Army Common Operating Environment (COE), mobile computing, and distributed computing strategies  <br>    <br>  Currently, PM TRADE's training systems comprise multiple, disparate sets of sub-systems located in exercise control centers, after action review buildings, range operation centers, edge devices (player units, cameras, tablets, etc.) in the field or on participants, and other collated facilities in support of training exercises at numerous installations. Within any given installation, multiple training systems coexist with duplicated hardware in support of multiple training systems.  <br>    <br>  PM TRADE will pursue an architectural analysis and implementation with the objective of identifying commonality and determining the feasibility of a centralized/distributed solution capable of simultaneously supporting the operational availability, training throughput, information assurance accreditation requirements of multiple systems, and safety and maintenance requirements of LT2 systems.   The ascendant objective is a common set of system components defined by a P/L that will facilitate migration to Training as a Service (TaaS), and provide for centralized operations and logistic support while reducing Operations and Maintenance (O&M) requirements and overall life-cycle cost.  <br>    <br>  LCPM will work in concert with CPM Next to manage the contractual framework by which PM TRADE will execute control of a systems life cycle within a System of Systems (SoS) environment to maximize the commonality, reuse and interoperability of the system, while maintaining integrity of the product lines from which it is based.  LCPM will continue to evolve the deliberate process for managing the development, assembly, production, integration, and sustainment of PM TRADE HPL.  It enables using organizations to maintain visibility and control of the configuration of those systems, and SoS integration for which they are responsible throughout the total system life cycle.   <br>    <br>  A Hardware Product Line (HPL) will be created to provide a common set of hardware components (mainly Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS)) and documentation data that will be used across multiple programs within the LT2 Family of Training Systems (FTS) to reduce the physical Information Technology footprint of existing fielded sites as PM TRADE migrates to TaaS.    <br>    <br>  Participation in the LT2 P/L is critical for the LCPM effort and is defined as utilizing LT2 P/L core assets, governance, standards, processes, tools, and environments for the development, testing, and life-cycle support of systems and subsystems.  These life cycle efforts will include tasks such as trade studies, analysis and forecasting, data collection and analytics, design, development, impact assessment, information assurance (IA), materiel procurement, integration, installation, testing, system training, documentation, logistics support, obsolescence management and disposal.    <br>    <br>  This proposed contract vehicle will support the life cycle requirements for the LT2 FTS and the full range of live training requirements from individual training to collective training at unit home stations, Combat Training Centers (CTCs), CTC Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT), Live Fire and Digital Ranges, and other training ranges throughout the world.  These programs include but are not limited to:  Digital Range Training Systems (DRTS), Integrated MOUT Training Systems (I-MTS), Targetry Range Automated Control and Recording (TRACR), Homestation Instrumentation Training System (HITS), Joint Pacific Multi-national Readiness Capability- Instrumentation System (JPMRC-IS), and Combat Training Center-Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) at the National Training Center (NTC), Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) and the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC).    <br>    <br>  The objective of LCPM effort will be to continue to managing the evolution of the LT2 P/L and provide total life-cycle support to those programs that utilize the LT2 P/L.  LCPM effort will also continue to meet the requirement for a consolidated streamlined approach that protects and leverages the Army's LT2 P/L investment, continues the development and evolution of the LT2 products/systems, core assets, architectural frameworks, and the LCPM HPF, while continuing to provide PM TRADE an efficient, effective, and agile method to accomplish:  <br>    <br>  -Development, integration, testing, management, maintenance, and evolution of the LCPM HPL in concert with the LT2 P/L (products, systems, SoS capabilities, architectures, processes, and core assets).  <br>  -Total life-cycle system management and P/L support.  <br>  -System baseline capture, documentation and updates to the LT2 P/L.  <br>  -Architectural and system development, and core asset evolution in support of external interoperability initiatives such as Live, Virtual, Constructive - Integrated Training Environment (LVC-ITE), Common Operating Environment (COE), Joint services initiatives, and other LT2 users as required within the LT2 P/L.  <br>    <br>  Industry Day Schedule:  The Government plans to conduct an Industry Day briefing on June 8 and then one-on-one sessions on June 9-11. A previous notification has been published on FedBizOps with the details.  To schedule a one-on-one session, please contact Mr. Jason Holden, (407) 208-3312, jason.n.holden.civ@mail.mil.  The Government encourages industry to send in critical comments and questions by June 4th so that the team can address those key issues to the community during the presentation. Detailed comments should be provided by June 19 for Government team review and potential incorporation into the initial technical package release.  <br>    <br>  During the one-on-one sessions the Government intends to discuss the following topics:  <br>    <br>  1. Do you understand the intent behind the LCPM effort?   <br>  2. What data does the Government need to provide to mitigate any Organizational Conflict of Issue (OCI) risks on this contract?  <br>  3. What NAICS code(s) do you suggest cover the preponderance of the work under LCPM?  <br>  4. What do you see as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate them?  <br>  5. The LCPM contractor will be required to work with the Warfighter FOCUS contractor, the CPM Next contractor and Government entities. What challenges does industry foresee and what recommendations can be provided to facilitate communication and interaction between all parties?  <br>    <br>  The Government intends to take the feedback and comments from the events of the 8 June week along with the written responses (if provided).  The Government will then publish a Sources Sought Notice in late June or early July.  <br>    <br>  The Government encourages industry to share general and specific comments to improve the quality and clarity of the LCPM concept and approach.  As a part of the market research acquisition phase, individual discussions regarding a contractor's solution will not be shared outside the Government team.  Industry is reminded that the Government is not providing feedback or assessment regarding contractor's solutions/capability.   <br>    <br>  A web-based portal hosts a reference library and contains a multitude of information related to PM TRADE's LT2 efforts. The library is located at https://www.lt2portal.org under the Collaboration tab and Life Cycle Product-line Management (LCPM) tab.  <br>     <br>  POCs: Program Manager, Mr. Thai Nguyen, (407) 384-5456, thai.h.nguyen2.civ@mail.mil  <br>  Contracts: Mr. Jason Holden, (407) 208-3312, jason.n.holden.civ@mail.mil   <br>    <br>  DISCLAIMER:  THIS NOTICE UPDATE is for Market Research purposes only and is being used as an instrument to identify potential technologies and sources that can provide the full or partial capabilities described within this notice.

<DESC>The amendment for the description listed below is as follows:   <br>      <br>        a.  Define the 'short-range Lock-on-After-Launch (LOAL)' mentioned in Integration Level 2A as being interceptor dependent, but typically 3-5Km or inside the acquisition range of the interceptor's seeker.     <br>      <br>        b.  Provided the PowerPoint file which provides additional information regarding the levels of integration discussed in the 'IFPC Inc 2-I Engineering Demonstration Overview' section of the referenced SSA, and the way a vendor's interceptor can be integrated with the IFPC Inc 2-I Multi-Mission Launcher tube.     <br>      <br>        c.  In order to meet requirement number 11 under the 'IFPC Inc 2-I Interceptor Requirements for Engineering Demonstration' section, interested vendors must provide some supporting documentation regarding their compliance with Cybersecurity Controls or Authorizations to Operate.  The vendor needs to prove that their system is not introducing any potential vulnerabilities into the IFPC Inc 2-I system at the interceptor level.  Specific items needed are a current Plan of Actions and Milestones (POA&M), a letter confirming Systems status [i.e. Authority to Operate (ATO) or Interim Authority To Test (IATT)], and a Pit Risk Approval Letter.  If a foreign interceptor is proposed the vendor must also provide the System Topology, a list of hardware and software used in the interceptor, and their plans for use of the Government System of Systems Integration Lab (SoSIL).   <br>      <br>       d. Number 4, Pro E Model of the MML Tube, will be deleted, from the list of documentation available upon request under the 'Government Furnished Equipment, Property and Information for the IFPC Inc 2-I Engineering Demonstration' section.     <br>      <br>   There is no change to the response date as a result of this amendment.      <br>      <br>      <br>   This is a sources sought announcement (SSA) for parties interested in participating in a bailment agreement with the IFPC Inc 2-I Product Office, CMDS Project Office.  The CMDS Project Office is soliciting parties interested in providing an interceptor to launch from the Multi-Mission Launcher (MML) during the IFPC Inc 2-I Engineering Demonstration (ED) in March 2016.  Interested candidates should be able to meet the requirements listed below.  Potential participants will be vetted for eligibility regarding the ability to fully integrate in accordance with the Tri-Services Guidance.  The USG reserves the right to terminate a bailment agreement at any time if it is determined through continued USG analysis that the interceptor will not meet all requirements.      <br>        <br>    The USG will not pay for information received or equipment used by the contractor.  The USG will provide certain Government-Furnished Equipment (GFE), Government-Furnished Information (GFI), test range time/access, and resulting test analysis.  Responses to this notice will be used to form a bailment agreement with each party that meets the requirements.  Any information provided will be protected in accordance with the document markings.  Any potential release of respondents' information to other Government agencies will be coordinated with the vendor prior to release.      <br>        <br>    IFPC INC 2-I PROGRAM OVERVIEW:    <br>        <br>    The IFPC Inc 2-I is a mobile ground-based weapon system designed to defeat    <br>    unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), cruise missiles (CM), and rocket, artillery, and mortar (RAM) projectiles. The system provides 360-degree protection with the ability to engage simultaneous threats arriving from different azimuths.  A Block acquisition approach will be used to provide this capability.  Block 1 will use an existing interceptor and sensor, and will develop a MML on an existing vehicle platform to support the counter-UAS and CM defense mission. The MML will use an open architecture that allows a variety of missiles to be employed. Block 2 will integrate additional interceptor(s), and new or modified sensor(s) to support the Counter-RAM mission.  Block 3 adds the capability for extended range engagements against UAS and CM to create an area defense system. This Block will potentially allow for other technology insertions (i.e., directed energy, rail gun). The system will use the Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense open systems architecture, and will use the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) as its mission command component.    <br>        <br>    IFPC Inc 2-I Attributes    <br>        <br>    Fire Control Sensor (FCS): The FCS for IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 will be the Sentinel radar in its current configuration.  The Sentinel radar is already fielded and will be organic to IFPC Inc 2-I Block 1 platoons.  The FCS's primary purpose is to provide 360  coverage to detect, possibly identify, and generate precision track information for given threats.     <br>        <br>    C2 Node: The IFPC Inc 2-I system will be capable of integrating into the IAMD network.      <br>        <br>    Launcher:  The MML will launch interceptors to meet threshold IFPC Inc 2-I CM Defense and Counter-UAS requirements for Block 1.  The MML provides a common launcher for current and future interceptors through the Modular Open Systems Architecture.  The MML design will allow for multiple missiles of different types to be hosted simultaneously.  The MML design will be capable of supporting an AIM-9X class interceptor which is the design reference missile for the IFPC Inc 2-I program.  The MML will use common interfaces to interface with multiple interceptor types.     <br>        <br>    The MML will communicate with the Command and Control (C2) node for sensor and interceptor engagement coordination. The MML will also provide system health and status data to external users through the C2 node. The IFPC Inc 2-I MML will accept targeting commands from the C2 node and will prosecute the engagement using the MML Fire Control, interceptor, and sensors.  The MML will include an MML executive software. The MML Executive will be composed of several Computer Software Configuration Items to communicate with the C2 node, receive and execute engagements, and perform maintenance and training. The MML Executive will control many of the MML Hardware Configuration Items.  The MML will host multiple interceptor vendor software applications on a single removable Solid State Drive. Software for each interceptor will be dynamically loaded on a dedicated, separate Weapon Interface Controller (WIC) during MML system initialization. The MML will be capable of hosting up to six WICs.      <br>        <br>    Interceptor:  The interceptor is the system's kill vehicle. It is integrated using a Modular Open Systems Architecture (e.g., common tube design, MIL-STD-1760 interface, plug and fight WIC).  The WIC and Engagement Calculator (EC) software will be provided by each interceptor vendor to comply with predefined common software, electrical, and mechanical Interface Control Documents.  The WIC will be a plug and fight single board computer, which will perform the following functions:    <br>        <br>    a.	Control interceptor states and modes.    <br>    b.	Issue engagement commands to the interceptor required to conduct engagement operations.    <br>    c.	Monitor and report interceptor status while on the launcher.    <br>    d.	Support fire control functions at the launcher.    <br>    e.	Provide interceptor-specific data used by MML fire control functions.    <br>    f.	Generate uplink commands as required by the interceptor type.    <br>        <br>    IFPC INC 2-I ENGINEERING DEMONSTRATION OVERVIEW    <br>        <br>    Interested parties will be provided the opportunity to launch their interceptor from the MML during the IFPC Inc 2-I ED in March 2016.  There are four levels of integration available to interested parties:     <br>        <br>    Level 1 -Interceptor firing by integration with the MML Launch Tube through the mechanical interface and a vendor-provided external firing set.  This firing may be a Ballistic Test Vehicle (BTV), a Controlled Test Vehicle (CTV), or a Guided Test Vehicle (GTV).    <br>        <br>    Level 2 - An Interceptor integrated with the MML Launch Tube through the mechanical and electrical interfaces, with an integrated WIC in the Weapons Interface Unit (WIU) and a vendor-provided external firing set.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, or the Government) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a project entitled "Provider Compliance Reporting System" (PCRS). This requirement is to acquire IT support services for the development, operations and maintenance of a PCRS. PCRS will be a browser-based application that is designed to provide CMS a single source of information on Medicare review programs from a provider perspective. The initial release/implementation of the PCRS will allow Medicare review contractors and CMS staff to view a provider profile (e.g. when a provider received education, which claims were reviewed by the MAC, RAC, and SMRC, and when a provider was referred for ZPIC review). In addition, PCRS will provide for improvements to CMS' improper payment activities by continuing to optimize and improve communication and workflow between CMS, Medicare review contractors, and the provider community. Future releases of the PCRS will allow providers to access certain provider-visible data via a CMS provider portal and esMD HIHS.
<p>This procurement is a competitive 8(a) set-aside, under the North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) Code 541512, Computer System Design Services, with a size standard of $27.5 million. It is anticipated that CMS will award a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with the total period of September 30, 2015 to December 29, 2017, which consists of a 12-month base period, one 12-month option period, and a 3-month transition out period.</p>
<p>The Contract award is anticipated on or before September 30, 2015. Questions related to this synopsis should be referred to Tiara Freeman, at Tiara.Freeman@cms.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>ADDED JUNE 5, 2015<br /><br />The purpose of this correspondence is to clarify for interested parties, what has been the progress to date and the results of our recent Advisory Multi-Step (AMS) process.</strong> This process was conducted by following the instructions in FAR 15.202. The reasons we conducted the AMS as part of our pre-solicitation activities are to:</p>
<p>1. Identify for the Department the pool of potential qualified offerors for the HITTSS-II acquisition.<br />2. Inform the companies who responded to the AMS what they need to correct in their AMS response packages to prepare better proposals for the HITTSS-II acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>The AMS process was not intended to:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Award any HITTSS-II contracts.<br />&bull; Disqualify any company from submitting a proposal when the HITTSS-II solicitation is issued.<br />&bull; Request any proposals and to evaluate any proposals.</p>
<p><br /><strong><em>Since no awards were made during the AMS process, no debriefings will be given. </em></strong>Instead each company that submitted a response package will be sent a letter (via email) from the Department that informs the party that they either passed the Department's review of their submittal, or if not, what was wrong with their submittal. This information will help you to correct any problems (if you choose to do so) giving you a better chance to submit a correct proposal (if you choose to do so) when the solicitation is released.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Here are the "takeaways" from the AMS process that we want you to understand:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; You may submit a proposal when the HITTSS-II solicitation is released regardless of your results from the AMS.</p>
<p>&bull; You do not need to submit anything now and not until the solicitation is released.<br /><br />&bull; Your company is required to be certified in only one of the business type categories, and can be certified in more than one in any combination.</p>
<p>&bull; Your company will be required to answer all 5 qualifications that were in the AMS when you submit a proposal because they will be included in the solicitation. They are repeated here for your reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Business Classification Certification<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o GSA Schedule 70 Contract or Similar Federal Government Contract<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Security Requirements<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System or Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Certification<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Corporate Infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong><em>Do not call or send emails concerning this information. You will be receiving your letter on your AMS package within the next 2 weeks.</em></strong></p>

The small business size standard is $16 million" TO correct as stated "541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services. The small business size standard is $27.5 million."&nbsp; All other terms and conditions of this announcement remain unchanged.<br /><br />This is a Sources Sought Only.</strong>&nbsp; The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is conducting market research to determine feasibility for a potential procurement requirement. <em>This is</em> <em>NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</em> The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to provide DOL with Java-based Web Application Development and Help Desk services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Updated 6/5/2015) </span></strong>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this request is <strong>541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services.<br /></strong>OBJECTIVE: <br /><br /><strong>The DOL, Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) is seeking information on an experienced contractor to provide Automated Data Processing (ADP) and Help Desk support for its Information Technology (IT) National, Regional and States in-house developed software applications.</strong> These services will be performed on-site. The Unemployment Insurance Database Management System (UIDBMS) is a comprehensive system that helps the National and Regional Offices to perform the oversight and monitoring function of the State Unemployment Insurance (UI) operations. OUI is seeking maintenance and enhancement of UIDBMS applications. As well as converting any remaining legacy applications to a web-based environment, OUI also develops new applications as determined by the Program Offices in OUI based on new laws and legislation passed by Congress. <br /><strong><br /><br />Based on the missions of the organization, five key objectives for this requirement were established:<br /></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Maintain the integrity of the National Office and States UIDBMS(s). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Ensure the communication between the National Office and State systems are operational.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Follow all CM procedures in development, testing, and documentation of all releases / upgrades.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Maintain all systems (production, test, and development) to the established baseline.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Responsive to state, National, and Regional users by whatever communication mode that is used.<br /><br />To be successful in achieving these key objectives, the contractor will work collaboratively with the Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) designated staff and provide services such as business solutions management, web-based software development and integration, testing, maintenance and documentation, help-desk, and end user support under this SOW. Web applications utilize the Informix relational database in a Solaris 11 server environment. UI application suite development includes external public facing (internet) as well internal (intranet) applications. An external (public) informational web site (https://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/) is also maintained.
<p>The contractor will ensure that all systems are maintained in a reliable manner that provides a consistent, timely, and appropriate service to the OUI. In addition, the contractor will be required to follow the approved System Development Lifecycle Methodologies (SDLCM) and work with the Office of Information Systems &amp; Technology (OIST) Security Team to maintain all security documentation in accordance with DOL standards for physical, access, and application security. OUI Operations (system hardware support, network support, system administration, &amp; database administration) support will be maintained by a separate contract administered by the Office of Chief Information Officer (OCIO) on behalf of OUI. However, the contractor will be required to interact with the OUI Operations group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CURRENT ENVIRONMENT:</span></strong> <br />The Java-based Web Application Development and Help Desk Services must be capable of interfacing with the existing environment.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />The UI Program:</span></strong><br />The current program is supported by a wide-range of computer systems comprised of UNIX-based servers, PC LAN laptops, various networking components and printers. Commercial software products (e.g., MS Office 2010, MS Outlook 365, MS Project 2010, MS Visio 2010, Adobe Acrobat XI, SPSS 22, etc.) and in-house developed and supported systems as well as sub-systems provide automation support.<br />The Unemployment Insurance Database Management System (UIDBMS) is comprised of, but not limited to, the following applications:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Unemployment Insurance Reports (UIR) - UI workload, performance and financial reports submitted by states as required by Federal law.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Tax Performance System (TPS) - systems and analytical support for data necessary to oversee tax programs.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) - systems and analytical support for data necessary to oversee benefit payment and non-payment accuracy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Benefit Finance Model (BFM) - programming and support in estimation, simulation, and actuarial systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Financial Management Report System (FMRS) - systems for administrative and financial management activities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. Chargeback (CHB) - Federal Agency Billing and Reimbursement System<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G. Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) - programming and support in providing benefit assistance because of a major disaster.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The OUI Network: <br /></span></strong>The current ETA network that support OUI's mission is a National Office network integrated into two local area networks (LANs)[The ETA LAN and the Regional LAN], and a wide area network (WAN).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The ETA LAN is based on the Windows 2008 networking operation system with Windows 2008 Workstation as the client base. The ETA network is managed by the Office of Information Systems &amp; Technology (OIST). Services provided include data communications and office automation capabilities for ETA organizations only. The network facilitates users to access and manipulate the major application and other services, such as home directories, on the LAN and provides office automation capabilities for the applications.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There are several types of communications services currently used on the ETA LAN including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) dedicated circuits,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) an Interstate Connection (ICON multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) network (managed by the MD Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (MD DLLR)),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) remote access dial-up/dial-out (back-up emergency only),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) email and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) Internet connectivity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The dedicated circuits are used for communication between the OUI Regional Offices, and the National Office while ICON and Internet connectivity services are used for communications from the National Office to the State sites.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The ETA LAN also provides users with access to the Internet. Data communications allow users to maintain and use their e-mail and Internet / Intranet services. Internet services are provided via T1 line connections using Cisco Routers for IP (internet protocol) routing and filtering.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The ETA network provides the infrastructure for the OUI UNIX network. This network is comprised of the National Office's UNIX-based computers and 54 computer systems located in each State, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Virgin Islands and the UI Training Center in Washington, DC.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Regional users have their own Regional LAN that is connected to the ETA network via fractional T1 frame relay leased lines. Regional users may select a menu option from their login menu that will connect them via the fractional T1 lines directly to the OUI UNIX network.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. The OUI UNIX network has been integrated into ETA's LAN. Data and E-mail are transferred to and from the National Office UNIX network and the 54 State computer systems via ICON, Internet connectivity services or remote access dial-up (back-up only). Some State Agencies have integrated their UNIX systems with larger State networks (generally PC-based) that are connected to the Internet; for these States modem communications for data transfer and E-mail have been replaced by Internet connectivity.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Currently, the National Office OUI UNIX network consists of Solaris 11.2 (x86) on Virtual Machine (VM) servers at the Department of Labor (DOL) Silver Spring Data Center (SSDC).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Batch file transfers between the National Office and the State sites occur primarily by asynchronous dial-up links and the UNIX-to-UNIX copy (UUCP) protocol. Each State has an Oracle SPARC T4-2 server that is polled by systems at the National Office. State sites are not allowed to dial into the National Office systems.</p>

<DESC>On June 4, 2015, the Technology Acquisition Center awarded Delivery Order VA118-15-F-0071 under the terms and conditions of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V contract NNG15SD19B with Alvarez & Associates, 8251 Greensboro Drive Suite 230, Tysons Corner, VA 22102.  Alvarez & Associates will be providing the expansion of the existing Personal Identity Verification Hewlett Packard (HP) Blade server and Storage Array.  The period of performance shall be from June 4, 2015 to June 3, 2016, in the total order value of $310,441.84.
?
JUSTIFICATION  
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	23 Christopher Way
     	Eatontown, NJ 07724
      
2.  Description of Action: This proposed action will limit competition to solicit for brand name Hewlett Packard (HP) Blade server and Storage Array resources under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC).  
3.  Description of the Supplies or Services: VA, Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Program Office has a requirement for additional HP Blade Servers and Storage Array System hardware with 5 year extended warranty support to augment VA's PIV Implementation Environment.  The PIV virtualization environment is located at two geographically separated locations.  The Production System is located at Martinsburg, West Virginia Capital Region Readiness Center (CRRC), and the Disaster Recovery system is located at Hines, Illinois Information Technology Center (ITC).  There are four existing HP Blade System c-Class (BLc) Blade Chassis at Martinsburg CRRC and four existing HP BLc Blade Chassis at Hines ITC. The proposed action shall include installation services for these additional HP server and storage hardware to include: inventory, set-up, start-up, installation, configuration, and integration of the additional Storage Area Networks (SAN) into existing system environment to full operation.  Hardware shall be delivered within 30 days of contract award with installation completed within 60 days of award, and the warranty support shall be 5 years from receipt of hardware.  
4. Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Paragraph 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B), entitled "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."
5. Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  This is a brand name justification in support of FAR Subpart 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on extensive market research, as described in paragraph 8 of this document, it was determined that limited competition is available for these brand name HP products.  HP Blade and Storage Array systems are uniquely integrated into PIV environment's infrastructure.  The expansion of any of these systems must be of the same manufacturer so that the hardware architecture will interoperate, integrate, and expand between the HP Blade chassis and to utilize the HP Virtual Connect Flex-IO technology within the HP Blade systems. Flex-IO technology is a hardware-based solution that enables the splitting of a 10 Gigabits server network connection into four variable partitions.  This technology allows network administrators to replace multiple lower bandwidth physical Network Interface Card (NIC) ports with a single Flex-IO port, thereby reducing management requirements, number of NICs and interconnect modules needed, and power and operational costs.  Only HP has the Virtual Connect technology, which is proprietary to HP.  Furthermore, the Integrated Lights-Out is an embedded server management technology exclusive to HP.  This unique server management system allows VA System Administrators with one management tool platform to manage all VA's Blade chassis.  Any additional component must be compatible and interoperable within the various HP Chassis.  Only HP Blade and Storage Array systems can integrate and interface with the existing HP Chassis and already integrated HP server-storage hardware.  Using alternative products would compromise VA's virtualization environment.  Only HP can meet all of the Government's requirements due to the existence of the current HP servers and storage arrays.  Furthermore, the Government does not possess the proprietary technical data and patents for the HP brand name server and storage systems.  Without this technical data, no other source has the ability to provide the aforementioned products and warranty support other than HP and their authorized resellers.  The HP Blade and Storage Array systems communicate through a source code that is based on HP proprietary data.  No other software can provide this communication capability without this source code.  Any other brand name system is unable to integrate or support currently fielded HP server and storage solutions partially without reworking and completely replacing the existing HP infrastructure.  A move to an alternative storage system and server infrastructure would require costly replacement of the existing entire HP based server and storage infrastructure rather than mere expansion at much reduced costs.  Based on historical data, the estimated cost of repurchasing the HP Chassis and SANs for just the PIV Production and Disaster Recovery networks would be $2M.  Switching to a new manufacturer would result in a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Additionally, substantial delays would be incurred that would delay delivery of PIV critical services.  
6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the required brand HP hardware.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized within 14 days of award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page and the justification will be made publicly available.
 7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the market place that would enable future actions to be competed.
8.  Market Research: The Government's technical experts conducted market research from October 2014 through April 2015 by reviewing other similar hardware products.  The team conducted research on server and storage systems manufacturers for availability of similar Blade Servers and Storage Array systems.  These vendors include Dell, Fujitsu, Toshiba, SuperMicro, Oracle, EMC,  IBM/Lenovo and Cisco.  Based on reviews of these products, the Government's technical experts determined that none of these products can meet the Government's interoperability and compatibility requirements previously discussed.  Additionally, none of these other products can offer the lateral communication of hardware management into the existing VA Enterprise HP architecture throughout VA data centers, which is critical in producing a unified view of all Blade infrastructures status over the network.  It was determined that acquiring similar Blade Servers and Storage Array systems from other original equipment manufacturers would require purchasing new compatible infrastructures from same vendor to host them.  Nonetheless, the new infrastructure would not be able to communicate with existing VA HP infrastructures and systems creating more problems.  Furthermore, VA networking Subject Matter Experts regularly review industry trade publications and conduct internet research to ascertain if other compatible brand name hardware is available.  Based on all of these market research efforts, the Government's technical experts have determined that only HP brand name Blade and Storage Array hardware can meet all of VA's needs. 
In April 2015, additional market research was conducted by the Government by viewing HP's authorized resellers on HP's website to see who could provide the requirement on NASA SEWP V GWAC.  There are four vendors in Group B (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses) that are authorized resellers of HP products and services.   Therefore, based on this market research there is an expectation of limited competition among resellers on the NASA SEWP V GWAC for brand name HP Blade server and Storage Array.  

9.  Other Facts: None.

<DESC>LIMITED SOURCES JUSTIFICATION
ORDER >$150,000
FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  

Contractor: Quest Diagnostics, Inc.	
Contractor Address: Three Giralda Farms, Madison, NJ 07940-1027	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	NCO 1 Consolidated Contracting Activity
		940 Belmont Street________________
	Brockton, MA 02301	
                                                                       VISN:	1	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
The contractor has a valid Federal Supply Schedule Contract V797P-7105A and has been providing satisfactory services.  Quest Diagnostics currently has all testing required by NCO 1 covering 27 sites (Medical Centers and Outpatient Clinics). The current Task Order ends on May 31, 2015 and there is not enough time to prepare a new solicitation without interrupting direct patient care services. The acquisition plan for the new contract is being routed for approval by the Head of Contracting activity.

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
The services will include: a) Interface with VA's VistA System. Best practice is to eliminate manual entry of results and employ an electronic result entry process; b)Transportation of clinical laboratory specimens, originating from the VA Medical Center and Satellite Outpatient Clinic laboratories destined contracted commercial reference laboratory ; c) IntraVISN transportation of clinical laboratory specimens originating from the VA medical center and satellite outpatient clinic laboratories destined to VA West Roxbury or VA West Haven; d) Performance of analytical testing; e)Reporting of analytical test results; e)Consultative services; f)Patient Service Centers within the New England area for phlebotomy services.
	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $600,000 for 2 months to work on long-term FSS BPA.

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   6/1/2015

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. 

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Phlebotomy Draw Stations or patient service centers are in convenient locations throughout North East that collect specimens and then transport them to the host facilities for testing.  This benefits the Government's CBOC's that do not have on-site phlebotomy service and also allows for test results to be entered in the patient record.  Courier Service/specimen transport between VA labs within the VA New England Healthcare VISN 1 for the purpose of Intra-VISN testing at the Government's core laboratories located at West Haven and West Roxbury.

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
Patient results are automatically transferred from Quest to VA Vista System.  This eliminates manual entry of patient results and vendor reference ranges.  Manual entry errors are a high risk area in the laboratory.   Best practice is to eliminate manual entry of results and employ an electronic result entry process.
1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
Set up cannot be transferred from one site to another.  Set up for this connectivity is not interchangeable between medical reference lab vendors.  In addition to the connectivity issue, any change in reference lab would require test file changes in the VISTA system. 
1	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
The current task order ends on May 31, 2015. Due to the short time frame of this direct patient care need, it is in the best interest of the Government to continue services with the incumbent for a two month period, with the option to extend services clause. 

 (5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
The prices offered represent the best value to the Department of Veterans Affairs consistent with FAR 8,404(d), because an additional discount to the FSS price list is given by Quest Diagnostics based on estimated volume for testing services.  It would not be feasible to change a vendor in this short time period.  In addition Quest Patient Service Centers are located within a short distance of many of the CBOC's in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island.  This is very convenient for our veterans not to travel great distances for this service and ensures better patient compliance. If this service was interrupted it would be detrimental to our Veterans.
(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted among the Federal Supply Schedule holders capable of providing medical reference lab testing services for the consolidated laboratory by the program manager.
 (7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The agency is working on a long term procurement plan, currently being routed for HCA signature before proceeding with a new contract.
