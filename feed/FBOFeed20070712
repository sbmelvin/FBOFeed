<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure, on a sole-source basis, with the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). The intended acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 235(c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Alaska Region, requires a analytical resources to evaluate available data and data systems used for assessment and management of fisheries in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and Gulf of Alaska (GOA).  Through this process, recommendations shall be developed on the extent to which current information sources support present and future information needs for science and management and provide guidance on potential improvements in information and information systems to allow statistical parameters to be incorporated into estimation processes.  The  objectives of this project are to: (1) Evaluate available data and current data systems to meet the in-season needs of NMFS Alaska Region and fishery assessment needs of the AFSC, (2) Identify the type of data available and its limitations, including statistical assumptions associated with all estimation procedures, (3) Provide recommendations for practical system design that incorporates statistical uncertainty into estimates of catch and bycatch, and (4) Develop comparable recommendations for optimal system design identifying any new information needed to inform it. The period of performance will be three years.

The only known source to perform the required work is PSMFC.  PSMFC is uniquely qualified to perform this work because of their role in coordinating and maintaining the required information from state and federal fisheries agencies through their office in Alaska.  Their staff have intimate knowledge of a range of confidential data sets which are stored in PSFMC databases.  A key role performed by PSFMC staff is providing custom integration of these disparate data sets so they can be used by authorized analysts.  The data they manage are used in Alaskan fisheries management and will be necessary to complete this work.  The data stored by PSFMC are confidential and PSFMC staff have received authorization to handle this confidential information from several different agencies in an agreement negotiated between them. NMFS lacks the authority to grant access to the data from agencies other than NMFS.  The data from other agencies are necessary to complete this work and PSMFC has that unique access in their role as a Commission.  In addition, their staff and Counsel already have expertise and knowledge of the confidentiality requirements applicable to the different sets of data they store. NMFS only has knowledge of the NMFS confidentiality requirements, which differ from state requirements.  Because the data in the PSMFC databases are confidential, no outside contractor can obtain access to the required data.

All interested parties must respond to this announcement by August 13, 2007.  Responses must include the contractor's name, contact information, and information indicating the contractor's capability to perform the services and can obtain access to the required data described herein. Documentation to support the contractor's capability to perform these services must also be submitted which includes the contract number, point of contact and phone number, and a description of services performed under previous contracts for the same services. Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will evaluate each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge and capability to perform these same services.  No solicitation is available at this time.

All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/.  In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.  The applicable NAICS is 541990 with a small business size standard of $6.5 M.

All interested concerns must submit documentation by email at Sharon.S.Kent@noaa.gov by August 13, 2007.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for simulation of launch abort system exhaust plumes with downstream surfaces- Phase 2 - extended measurements and scaling methods.	 NASA/ARC intends to purchase the services from Sustainable Technology, LLC of 2829 Ohara Drive, Tallahassee, FL 32309-3244. The contractor has previously acquired an extensive base of flow measurements for the specific jet conditions required for this study. This task is a follow-on to a previous study and will extend the measurement range of that study. The contractor will provide a hot jet test facility to obtain these extended measurements.  The objectives of this study include the following:  Extend measurements of pressure fluctuation for a simulated CEV surface exposed to hot, warm and cold exhaust plumes beyond the spatial regions specified in the previous study (Phase 1). The cylindrical surface will be placed at various locations and orientations that are based on the CEV - ARES schematic arrangement provided by NASA.  Verify scaling relations, and their range of applicability, for the effects of jet temperature and Mach number on the fluctuating pressure level and its spectrum, using data from this study, as well as data from prior studies and rocket tests.  The contractor must meet the following requirements:  A. Set up model experiment in a contractor-supplied hot jet aeroacoustic facility to measure unsteady surface pressures on a government provided model equipped with government provided unsteady pressure transducers.

<SUBJECT>A--NASA OFFERS PRE-SCREENING OF PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL EXPLORER OPPORTUNITY
<SOLNBR>NNH07SMD002O
<ARCHDATE>07122008
<CONTACT>Dr. Hashima  Hasan, Program Scientist, Phone 202-358-0692, Fax 202-358-3096, Email smexao@nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) offers the opportunity of pre-screening Principal Investigator (PI) experience requirements to prospective investigators who plan to respond to its Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for Small Explorer (SMEX) missions, a draft of which was released for public comment on June 8, 2007. A copy of the draft AO is available at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	   (select "Solicitations" then "Open Solicitations" then Small Explorer (SMEX) and Missions of Opportunity  DRAFT (NNH07ZDA00XO)). The PI minimum experience requirements will be described in Section 4.5.1 and Appendix H of the AO when it is released, and instructions for demonstrating the satisfaction of the PI minimum experience requirements will be described in Appendix B part I.7 of the final AO. The text for these sections has been revised and clarified from the text that was provided in the draft AO. The revised text for Section 4.5.1, Appendix B part I.7, and Appendix H are available at the SMEX Additional Information Page at http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/smexacq.html	   and should be used in lieu of the text provided in the draft AO. NASA intends to include this revised text in the final AO.  Investigators desiring pre-screening should submit a completed copy of Table B7 as revised. A copy of the revised Table B7 as well as instructions for submitting the completed revised Table B7 are available at the SMEX Additional Information Page at http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/smexacq.html	   .  NASA is offering this opportunity as a service to prospective investigators. A request for pre-screening is thus voluntary and is not required by NASA. It is the intent of NASA to offer the pre-screening opportunity after release of the final AO as well. In response to the request for pre-screening, NASA will inform the investigator that the submitted Table B7 is, or is not, sufficient to demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements as described in the revised AO text have been met. For submissions that do not adequately demonstrate that the PI minimum experience requirements have been met, NASA will indicate which component of the PI minimum experience requirements has not been demonstrated by the submission. NASAs response will be through an email to the submitter. NASA intends to include in the final AO the revised text being made available. If the Table B7 submitted passes the pre-screening, then this same Table B7 will be adequate to pass the compliance check for PI minimum experience if this Table B7 is included in the proposal submitted to NASA in response to the final AO. Release of the final SMEX AO has not been formally approved by NASA. By offering this service to prospective investigators at this time (prior to release), NASA is under no obligation to issue the AO and solicit proposals. Any costs incurred by prospective investigators in preparing submissions in response this invitation are incurred completely at the submitter's own risk.  NASA will conduct screenings every 3 weeks prior to release of the SMEX AO. Submissions received by July 13 will receive a response from NASA by July 23. Submissions received by August 3 will receive a response from NASA by August 13. Submissions received by August 24 will receive a response from NASA by September 4. Submissions received by September 14 will receive a response from NASA by September 24. Additional opportunities will be announced in the SMEX AO. Questions may be addressed to Dr. Hashima Hasan, Explorer Program Scientist, Science Mission Directorate, NASA, Washington, DC  20546; Tel.: (202) 358-0692; Email: smexao@nasa.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR Subpart 13.5, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation Reference number is 07-42-0070Rev1 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334290.  The deadline for submitting quotes is Thursday, July 19, 2007 at 3:00 PM EDT.  The OCIO/NLRB intends to purchase the following: 1. AVENTAIL EX-2500 APPLIANCE PAIR WITH 50 CONCURRENT USER LICENSE, 2. AVENTAIL ASSURANCE FOR 1 YEAR GOLD SUPPORT FOR EX-2500 APPLIANCE PAIR. 3. Shipping, if any. F.O.B. Destination is Washington, DC 20005.  Brand Name Justification for Aventail Appliance procurement:The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is in the process of upgrading its remote access capabilities to support additional users, via a larger appliance, and to provide high availability, through the addition of a second fail-over appliance, for this critical service.  In order to maintain a high level of compatibility with our enterprise infrastructure, and to best leverage existing OCIO staff and end user knowledge, the NLRB is seeking bids only for Aventail remote access appliances. All remote access to NLRB enterprise applications and infrastructure is presently enabled through a single Aventail appliance.  This has been the case since the Agency began the switch to a virtual VPN service from direct dial-up access nearly two years ago.  The Agency presently is engaged in a project to link the existing Aventail appliance to an RSA SecurID solution to permit the mandated two-factor authentication for remote access.  The benefits of continuing to deploy an Aventail solution are both hard-, as the new appliances will simply plug-into the existing infrastructure, and soft, as the Agency?s past training and experience of both OCIO staff and end-users will most certainly be best leveraged in this manner.
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors/Commercial Items applies.  Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation/Commercial Items.  Evaluation factor is price and price related items.   FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acquisition.gov/far/.   CCR Requirement/ Company shall be registered on Central Contractor Registration (CCR) before an award can be made to them.  If your company is not registered in CCR, you may do so by going to the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov.  Offers should include price, delivery terms and DUNS number.  Submit your quote via email by Thursday, July 19, 2007 at 3:00PM EDT to Madan Kar at madan.kar@nlrb.gov.  The NLRB reserves the right to award without discussions. For any questions, please call the responsible contracting officer at 202-273-4129.

<DESC>This requirement was previously synopsized as N624020062088 (23 August 2006), as a service disabled veteran owned small business set-aside (SDVOSB).  The synopsis was subsequently cancelled by amendment dated 06 September 2006 due to a challenge by SBA as to whether the effort should be set-aside for the 8(a) program.  A sources sought synopsis was issued 14 September 2006 inviting interested 8(a) and SDVOSB firms to provide capability information.  Information received was evaluated by the PCO and forwarded to SBA.  As a result of this evaluation and review, the original decision to set the requirement aside for SDVOSB was confirmed.

It is anticipated that a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.  The closing date for receipt of proposals will be established in the Request For Proposals (RFP).  It is intended to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the solicitation.  The source selection will consider the offerors? technical proposal more important than the offerors? Price/Cost Proposal.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code and Small business size standard are 611699 and $6.5M, respectively.  Upon its release, the RFP will be made available electronically at www.neco.navy.mil.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
12 July 2007

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health (AFIOH) at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is establishing the acquisition strategy for its Epidemiology Surveillance Division.  This is not a Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this posting.  The Government reserves the right to amend this strategy in any manner deemed appropriate.  In no way does this posting obligate the Government.

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA), also known as a cost per test, for autoimmune testing reagents and use of platforms necessary to perform those tests.   Though there are a number of platforms capable of performing autoimmune tests, this particular acquisition is sourcing usage of a fully automated platform/s capable of conducting simultaneous testing per sample with walk away technology and with a requisite number of samples per hour.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is ?325413- In Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing?.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: Market research is being conducted in order to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms, to provide reagents and access to a testing platform that is fully-automated, exhibits walk-away technology, and is capable of delivering 22 results per sample at 100 samples per hour.  The instrument/s must use technology that permits simultaneous detection and identification of the following:  anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), dsDNA antibody tests, and extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) tests for the following antibodies: Sm, RNP, SS-A, SS-B, and Centromere.   In addition, the instrument/s must be capable of bi-directional interface with AFIOH?S Laboratory Information Medical System.  The platform would be located at Brooks City Base, San Antonio, TX.   

The government is also sourcing an automated platform for an HIV-1 Western Blot that must exhibit walk away technology, and must maintain subsequent reagent additions capable of dispensing and aspirating up to 20 strips in 90 seconds.  This platform would reside at Brooks City Base, San Antonio, TX.   

All reagents must be FDA-approved and shall exhibit at least 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

The vendor would retain title to the instruments during the entire term of the agreement, and would monitor the equipment to ensure that downtime would not exceed 48 hours for a single occurrence.   It is anticipated that the agreement would be in place for five years  with the following estimated number of tests per year:

Description	Tests/Yr.	
	ANA Screen		  23,165	
	dsDNA test		    1,860
	ENA tests for:
   SS-A/Ro		    3,200
	   SS-B/La		    3,200
	   Sm			    3,200
	   RNP			    3,200
	   Centromere		    3,200

A draft PWS is attached to this RFI

3.  INFORMATION REQUESTED:  Interested parties are requested to respond with the following information via email by 19 July 2007:

a.	Recommendation regarding Small Business Set-Aside or Full-and-Open Competition and a brief explanation for rationale.
b.	Any questions or recommendations that could affect the Performance Work Statement.  
c.	The technical capabilities of the potential offeror.  Please remember that this is not a request for proposal.

4.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:  The government anticipates award of this agreement in September of 2007.

<DESC>The Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement, Office of Aviation (INL/A) has identified a requirement to acquire an Infrared (IR) small arms detection system supporting INL/A operations.  

This is an INL/A initiative to rapidly field a small arms detection and warning system for aircrew alert and situational awareness of active threat weapons firings.  This program is designed to increase the safety and survival of aircrews and their mission aircraft by alerting them, in near real-time (less than 1 second), of hostile fire events in order to avoid them.  The system will be integrated in an INL/A OV-10D and flown to verify and demonstrate its effectiveness.  Additionally, the event will be transmitted to an additional aircraft flying in support.  The system on the support aircraft will consist of a display and the necessary datalink equipment to receive the alert information in the form of a geo-rectified position and basic vector to the point of origin of the event.

This requirement includes installation of the required system sensors on an INL/A OV-10D and demonstration of the effectiveness of the system in CONUS.  Once successfully tested in CONUS the system will be moved to a TBD OCONUS location for demonstration to prove the system in the actual operational environment.  This effort provides aircrews the opportunity to see and verify the system capabilities and allows for user input before determining if the effort should be continued on a larger number of aircraft in the INL/A fleet.  As a baseline, the aircraft will be outfitted with a system providing a minimum of 240 degrees (preferably 360 degrees) of horizontal coverage. 

A draft copy of the solicitation statement of work is provided for industy comment before the final solicitation is released.     Comments on the draft solicitation statement of work may be emailed to Patrick Murphy - murphypj@state.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing has POSTED the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidders Library on 12 JULY 2007.  

The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidders Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 

OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his/her concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels.  The Ombudsmans role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offerors concern on a non-attribution basis.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern when requested by the offeror.  The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.  The Ombudsman is Mr. James H. Gill SMC/PK, and he can be reached at James.Gill @losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789.

The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary to order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contracts, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified to each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and include item (d), as necessary:

a.	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license, at a minimum, shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitted; and

b.	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

c.	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

d.	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBA documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously, or at the time of pick up, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2.  Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter, as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

	3.  Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for what specific time thereafter, as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

	4.  Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractors record copy, at the time of Release of Claims, to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding the hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The government intends to negotiate a Firm Fixed Price type purchase order for material in accordance with FAR part 13.5 (Clinger-Cohen), for Explosive Ordinance Disposal Mobile Unit Eight (EODMU8) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The material is required for EODMU8 to provide for the safety of the forward deployed units of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Thermo?s Identifinder is a lightweight hand held device used to identify isotopes when radiation is present or suspected.  It captures a spectrum which is immediately compared to its internal library of isotopes for instantaneous computer interpretation of the isotopes present.  The spectrum is then downloaded and transmitted to Subject Matter Experts (SME) at the Department of Energy (DOE) for further analysis.  This acquisition is in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).  The Government?s minimum needs have been verified by Certifying technical and requirements personnel.  This requirement is for items solely manufactured by Thermo Scientific.  The IdentiFinder, p/n IDF-EODKIT, is a patented unit and therefore is only available through Thermo Scientific.  Thermo Scientific, 27 Forge Pky, Franklin, MA 02038, is also the only know source of supply for this unit.  Substitutes in brand name would not be feasible because this is a technical unit requiring extensive training in the operation and is already in use in the field by other EOD units.  
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519.  A complete RFQ package will be available on or about 9 JULY, 2007.  All responsible sources must submit pricing and past performance data by 3:00 p.m. on the date the offer is due.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www.fedizopps.gov.  This office no longer issues hardcopy solicitations.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the offerors at anytime prior to award.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency.  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal.  By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside of the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.gov.

2. QUESTION - Do you have some idea how many presentations for the larger groups will be required? 

ANSWER -
We're looking at 20 participants & unfortunately we prefer in person rather than over the phone..  The training needs to be held in Dallas in the regional office or downtown area because travel dollars are limited.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Director General, Office National de l'Assainissement du Senegal, Direction Generale cite TP SOM n?4 Hann, Dakar, Senegal Phone: (221) 832-35-33 Fax: (221) 832-35-31 Feasibility Study: Corniche West Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to evaluate the viability of wastewater collection and treatment facilities in the city of Dakar.  

Economic development and growth in Senegal has not always considered environmental issues in planning and implementation.  Urbanization and industrialization has contributed significantly to the scale of pollution in the country, particularly in urban areas such as Dakar.  Like many other countries in the region, considerable catch-up is required before public infrastructure elements such as water supply, sewerage and storm drainage are capable of supporting economic and urban growth, reducing poverty and enabling sustainable development.

In March 2005, the Government of Senegal (GoS) published a Sectoral Policy Letter for Urban and Rural Water and Sanitation. The intent of this publication was to document the progress that had been made in Senegal in achieving the objectives for poverty reduction associated with the Millennium Development Goals - the UN blueprint for poverty reduction by 2015.  Through its sectoral policy letter, the GoS has identified that the urban sanitation sector within the country faces a number of significant constraints. This includes the fact that the number of households that have access to proper sanitation facilities is significantly less than those that have access to water supply.  

To improve the urban sanitation situation, the GoS has given this sector a high priority, and established a strategy which has four main elements, namely: 
-The development of effective organizational and institutional frameworks for both water supply and sanitation services;
-The reinforcement of its existing technical infrastructure as a result of increasing demand, a need to improve the quality of service, and the need to expand services to accommodate the growing population and geographical spread of the city;
-The need to improve the financial balance by which expenditures associated with effective service will be offset by sufficient revenues to make those enhanced services sustainable;
-The need to focus targeted actions on the reduction of poverty associated with the Millennium Development Goals.

ONAS (the agency responsible for managing urban sanitation and operating the public sewer network within the country) has proposed a rehabilitation of the wastewater collection network that serves an older portion of Dakar (Corniche West).  Currently, this wastewater is discharged into the ocean, with no treatment, about 200 yards from shore. In conjunction with rehabilitation of the collection pipes and evaluating the collection system, ONAS has plans for construction of a 10 to 20 million gallons per day treatment plant and a longer outfall pipe (the "Project"). This Feasibility Study would consider the technical and economic implications of both aspects of the Project.

In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, Local Time on July 30, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Carmen Lindstrom, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3146
<DESC>The following are questions that have arisen due to this solicitation: 1. RFP SOW Paragraph 3.7.4 refers to a Technical Point of Contact for the SOW.  Is that person available to us and, if so, could you please provide contact  information. - No, that person is not available to you directly. If you need to  ask them questions, please send them to me and I'll forward them for you and send you their reply. 2. INSTRUCTION FOR SUBMISSION Technical Details - Volume 3 is limited to 10  pages. Since SOW Paragraph 3.4 requires a full description of the armored kit and required accessories and the Evaluation Factors require us to demonstrate  our full understanding of the requirements plus cover all of the specific items  requested for Chapters 1, 2, and 3, we respectfully ask that you consider adding 5 pages to the Volume 3 page limit. - The page limitation needs to stand as it is due to the various comparisons that will be made with the many offers that are coming in. If there is any need for further evaluation, the evaluators will ask for more details and you can expound at that time. 3. Are fold-out pages allowed? - Yes  4. RFP SOW Paragraph 3.2 requires top drawings, in-process drawings and process  descriptions to be delivered on the contract. Could you please confirm these are not required for the proposal since they are not addressed in the INSTRUCTION FOR SUBMISSION? - At this time, I'll say no but if it changes, we  will ask for it separately.  5. Are you making bidder Questions and Answers available to all bidders and if  so, could you please provide them to us? - To date, no other questioners have come to my attention.  6. On page 4 of 56, under 3.7:  We are instructed to "manufacture two modular armor kit prototypes for two trucks (four kits total) listed below within sixty  days of contract award."  The trucks listed below are:     Toyota Tundra: 5 kit minimum (US model year 2007 4-door w/short bed, auto A/c, no options, no accessories), and     Toyota Tacoma : 5 kit minimum (US model year 2007 4-door w/short bed, auto  A/c, no options, no accessories) Yet on page 16 and 17 of 56, ITEM NO 0003, SUPPLIES/SERVICES, QUANTITY  2:  We  are directed to buy 2 each:     Toyota Tundra Truck 2007     FFP     2 Door Base Model     FOB: Destination  and     Toyota Tacoma Truck 2007     FFP     2 Door Base Model     FOB: Destination Will you please clarify? - For consolidation of space, the descriptions on  pages 16 & 17 were shortened. The description on page 4 is the correct and  complete one for the kits - 2 kits per truck. 7. What criterion will be used to determine the performance of the armor  material, MIL-STD-662F and/or other? Follow up: How is the 95% probability going to be calculated if there are only 3 shots fired with no penetrations allowed? -MIL-STD-662F will be used to determine the performance of the armor material.  The confidence level will be inferred from analysis of the level of  damage inflicted by the threat munition. 8. Why is the transparent glass specified at a lower threat level (9x18mm) than  the opaque armor? Is this intentional or an oversight? -The transparent glass  is a desired feature and considered to be a much more difficult technical challenge. 9. Why is the much higher .50 caliber AP threat specified as a desired goal for  vehicles that cannot support the weight of such armor? Is there a minimum distance that is desired for that round other than the 100 meters specified as 100 meters is unrealistic for these vehicles? -The .50 caliber AP threat is a desired goal.  10. What is the intended purpose of the 12â Swatch? Our material is provided  with an environmental protective coating. Will the swatch be inspected âas isâ with this coating intact or will the coating be removed? If so, what types of testing will be performed; specifically, what is meant on page 10, under Volume 2, by âphysical and chemical validationâ? If the swatch is to be dismantled, is there a non-disclosure agreement for proprietary materials? -The swatch is  required to validate the contractor's approach.  Tests conducted will vary with  the type of materials submitted.  The swatch  will be inspected "as is" if the  sample is so labeled.  As long as the material is labeled proprietary, the US Government is legally obligated to safeguard such materials. 11. Is there a preferred vehicle color? -No color preference exists. 12.  Page 5 of  56, the last sentence in 3.7.4 reads:  "For additional information on blast protection, the contractor with confirmed appropriate  security clearance may submit a request to the Technical point of contact of  this scope of work."  What level is the "appropriate security clearance"? - Government Secret 13.  Is the award date established? - No 14.  Request confirmation that non-electronic submission via CD is acceptable  and that no hard copies are required or desired. Please clarify the number of copies of the CD required/desired. It would also be helpful to know the version of Microsoft Office you use so we can be assured of compatibility. - Electronic and non-electronic submissions are acceptable. We will require 4 copies of the  proposal: 2 with pricing information and 2 without any pricing information. Microsoft Office Version 2002 is currently being used.

<CONTACT>MARILYN HUTCHISON PURCHASING AGENT 3032369332     ;
<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies and services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 14 calendar days from the date of this synopsis. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has a requirement for rapid development of an unsupervised approach for mapping wetland hydrologic functions across the Prairie Potholes.  Knowledge of previously developed approaches for characterizing and quantifying ecosystems in the Prairie Potholes Region, specifically with respect to wetland dynamics and hydrologic functions, is necessary in order to expeditiously complete this research project.

Statement of Work
PROJECT TITLE:  MIGRATION AND CONTINUED SUPPORT TO THE MARINE CORPS ENLISTED ADMINISTRATIVE SEPARATION SYSTEM (MCEAS)
1.  BACKGROUND
Marine Forces Reserve (MARFORRES) processes nearly 2000 Enlisted involuntary administrative separations annually.  An administrative separation is a discharge or release of a Marine from active duty upon or prior to expiration of enlistment, period of induction, or other required period of service, as required by regulation or law, but specifically excluding punitive separation by the sentence of a general or special court-martial.  This process must be accomplished flawlessly to comply with legal due process requirements.  The Commanding General?s of the Marine Forces Reserve Major Subordinate Commands take final action on cases of Marines under their command.  Processing is initiated at approximately 200 geographically dispersed reserve unit sites. 

The Marine Corps Enlisted Administrative Separations System (MCEAS) was implemented 1 September 2001.  The MCEAS system has provided a paperless method of submitting, tracking, and approving administrative separations over the past 5 years.  The MCEAS system has generated thousands of administrative separation folders.  The MCEAS database is currently housed on the operating platform KCMA Domain server at Mobilization Command (MOBCOM) in Kansas City, Missouri.  Mission capability requires the MCEAS program to be migrated to MARFORRES VM Server also located at MOBCOM, Kansas City.  At this time, the MCEAS program does not have any technical support to manage the program to address database management outside the administrative user processes.  

2. OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE

Objective.   The MCEAS database should be migrated from the KCMA Domain server to the MARFORRES VM server.  Additionally, a maintenance contract for technical assistance needs to be established with vendor to address technical errors and necessary upgrades required for the MCEAS system.  After migration, the MCEAS system must pass testing by Marine Forces Reserve, Staff Judge Advocate and MOBCOM, G-6.  The system will continue:
1.	To retrieve relevant data from pre-existing Marine Corps data source to auto-populate fields in electronic forms to confirm the submission of complete and accurate separation packages.
2.	Require appropriate levels of data encryption, access to data, and data warehousing to allow the secure transmission and storage of large volumes of fully searchable and retrievable data for record keeping and record maintenance purposes.
3.	To be paperless to the maximum extent practical: it will utilize electronic forms, digital signatures utilizing Department of Defense Common Access Cards (CAC), be stored in secure databases and data stores and be staffed electronically.  

Scope.  The scope of this upgrade is for services to continue processes that are required to submit and track enlisted administrative separations in the Marine Forces Reserve.

The upgrade process will consist of three stages.  The government will retain the option of continuing to the next stage.

Stage I  will consist of the analysis, current system design, data storage review, and method of backup. MOBCOM G-6, with the assistance of the contractor will migrate MCEAS system from the operating platform in the KCMA Domain to a MARFORRES VM server.  All relationships and components of the application and supporting database will be documented during this Stage.   

Stage II will consist of the MARFORRES SJA and MOBCOM G-6, with the assistance of the contractor, testing the MCEAS system on the MARFORRES VM server and updating the documentation produced in Stage I (as required). Post-migration support will include an implementation and documentation of an automated backup and restoral system utilizing existing resources on the MARFORRES network.  

Stage III will consist of the procurement of a maintenance contract to provide continued technical/programming assistance to government MCEAS administrators to maintain the application, supporting database, and operation as defined in Stage I and II.  Requirements may also include application enhancements or upgrades if required and assistance with the maintenance of other Oracle applications.   Specific enhancement required of the program consists of the development of user interface adhoc reports and improvement of database user interface.  Support will be provided during normal working hours and within 24 hours of service call.

3.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS  

- All deliverables will include the contractors name, address, and contract number.
- MARFORRES will provide adequate workspace for the contractor, including phone, dial-out capability and access to any internal MARFORRES project management networks and/or software.  
- All Operating System Software must be installed and configured prior to any activities performed by the project team.  Sufficient system resource and space needs to be provided to establish a development and testing environment.
- Support personnel must be proficient in PL/SQL programming, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Forms and Reports, XML and JAVA Servlets.

4.  SPECIFIC TASKS

A.	The contractor shall provide system analysis and technical expertise to MARFORRES to accomplish the following tasks:
(1)	  Perform a system backup prior to the upgrade. 
(2)	  Assist in the migration of the MCEAS application (Database and Application Server) from the KCMA domain server?s to the MARFORRES VM server?s.   
(3)	  Test the MCEAS application after the migration on the MARFORRES VM server by running a user acceptance test.
(4)	  Document/Diagram the MCEAS application and system integration.  All documentation will be prepared using Microsoft Office products.

B.	Request implementation of a maintenance contract in order to provide Oracle programming expertise.
(1)	  Establish an on call maintenance contract for MCEAS system administrators to call for assistance with MCEAS system errors and Oracle upgrades and patches. 
(2)	This maintenance contract is not to exceed 250 hours per fiscal year.
(3)	Implement user interface report capabilities and create adhoc reports features for database administrators and users for data extraction.
(4)	Improve user interface operability of MCEAS database to increase ease of use of the program.

5.  DELIVERABLES
1.	MCEAS is migrated from the KCMA Domain to a VM Server on the MARFORRES Domain and is tested by MCEAS administrators and functioning to the same extent as before the migration.
2.	A system diagram showing the flow of each module (PL/SQL packages and procedures, XML, JAVA Servlets, Forms and Reports) and integration of the modules for the MCEAS application.  All documentation will be prepared using Microsoft Office products.

<RESPDATE>072307
<ARCHDATE>09212007
<CONTACT>Cory Price cory.price@va.gov 512-383-4303
<DESC>A.	BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Financial Services Center (FSC) provides financial services within the Department and to other government agencies (OGAs).  One of these services is the processing of electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions using the HIPAA ASC X12 standard business language format.  As such, the VA FSC provides centralized EDI services for all Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO) healthcare &quot;eProjects&quot; and serves as the sole interface for data exchange with the VHA CBO external partners. Specifically: 1.	The CBO EDI transactions that are processed by the VA FSC include healthcare electronic claims (X12N 837 and NCPDP), electronic remittance advice and EFT information (X12N 835) and electronic eligibility inquiries and responses (X12N 270/271).  These transactions are currently routed through the Emdeon and PNC Bank clearinghouses.  These transactions are received and sent in a flat file format from the VA Medical Centers.  The VA FSC translates the data to and from the flat file format to X12N/NCPDP transaction sets. 2.	The VA FSC receives approximately 650,000 835s (107,000 commercial 835s and 540,000 MRA 835s) and 8,000 835 electronic fund transfers (EFTs) per month (as of June 2006).  Additionally, the CBO is not live with 835s for pharmacy claims.  Given that more and more payers are returning 835s electronically and with the introduction of electronic Pharmacy 835s, the CBO expects this volume to increase significantly. 3.	The VA FSC processes nearly 2 million 837 transactions and 80,000 NCPDP transactions per month.  The 837 volume has been gradually increasing as medical centers print fewer claims locally.  In addition, a project is underway to increase the percentage of Medicare secondary claims sent electronically end-to-end to the payers.  This volume of electronic claims is expected to reach 2.5 million in FY07.  The CBO is currently beta testing customized e-Pharmacy software.  National rollout is scheduled for June - November 2007.  Anticipated NCPDP volume in FY07 is approximately 500,000 per month. 4.	The VA FSC sends and receives approximately 40,000 eligibility inquiries and responses (270/271) transactions per month.  Enhancements to the electronic insurance verification software are planned for Fall 2007.  The CBO expects that connections with new payers along with the software enhancements will result in a tripling of the volume. Operational management of the VA FSC's EDI infrastructure requires sophisticated, proven tools. The VA FSC needs a software tool, which has the ability to track and audit the flow of HIPAA data, monitor patterns and variability within the eBusiness transactions, and establish triggers and alerts for exception handling.  This software tool must accomplish the following: 1.	Reduce the incidence of lost or misplaced data 2.	Improve transactional data quality 3.	Increase first pass transactions acceptance rates with payers which directly impacts revenue cycle metrics and revenue stream 4.	Improve VA's ability to identify payer adjudication anomalies B.	OBJECTIVE: The VA FSC requires an EDI transaction management/analysis software solution for processing, monitoring, storing, reporting on and analysis of electronic transaction data within the VA FSC. C.	ASSUMPTIONS:   1.	The Contractor shall: a.	Establish and maintain a liaison with the VA FSC Financial Support Service (FSS) staff to ensure that the services provided will meet the VA FSC's requirements. D.

The IT hardware environment is comprised of Dell servers; Dell Storage Area Network (SAN) with associated disk arrays, Cisco switches and tape backup system The VA FSC Healthcare EDI technical environment is complex and dynamic.  VA FSC currently supports EDI transactions for institutional and professional claims (X12N 837), claims payments and remittance advices (X12N 835), eligibility verification (X12N 270/271), and retail pharmacy claims (NCPDP 5.1).  In addition to the EDI transactions, the VA FSC Healthcare EDI has developed reporting applications and is responsible for data interfaces with other parts of the organization, including the national network of VA Medical Centers. The following provides an overview of the technology currently in use, including high-level process flows of the key applications.

<SUBJECT>D -- AutoAudit Maintenance & Support Renewal
<DESC>Request for Information:  Subject to final approval, The Department of the Treasury?s Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Paisley Consulting, Inc. for AutoAudit Maintenance & Support Renewals. The Government intends to award for a base period of one year and three option years.

Mission:  TTB?s mission is to collect alcohol and tobacco excise taxes; to ensure that these products are labeled, advertised, and marketed in accordance with the law; to administer the laws and regulations in a manner that protects the consumer and revenue, and promotes voluntary compliance.

TTB Background:  On January 24, 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (the Act) established the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau within the Department of the Treasury.  The main responsibilities of TTB are protecting the public and collecting revenue.  These responsibilities are carried out by developing regulations, conducting product analyses, and ensuring tax and trade compliance with the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and the Internal Revenue Code. 

Nature and Description of Action:  The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau?s Tax Audit Division and Trade Investigations Division implemented a management information system to support the automated work paper system for Audit processing and Investigations.  AutoAudit was purchased in 2003 from Paisley Consulting, Inc. for this purpose, and is critical to the continued documentation and recording of this information. TTB has rights to use the software via license agreement.

A sole source to Paisley is intended for this order, based on licenses requirement.  No other known source has access to this license.

No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than seven days after publication of this notice.  Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.  If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements and that is more advantageous to the Government, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Paisley Consulting, Inc.

Information TTB Desires from Vendors:  TTB would like information (no more than 6 pages) on AutoAudit maintenance and support that will maintain the existing software (241 licenses), for a base and three option years.

Other Information:  The information being requested is for planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information requested.  TTB will assess the ability of the market to meet the needs as stated above, based on the information received.  The vendor must identify their business size classification (i.e. SDVOSB, 8(a), Woman-owned), as well as provide any available contract vehicles, such as GSA Schedule.  Dependent upon the results of this market survey, TTB may subsequently issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) to acquire the support services.  Electronic submissions, in response to the RFI, shall be sent to the attention of Mindy Wargowsky and e-mailed to psb3@bpd.treas.gov.  Electronic submissions must be received no later than 2:00 PM ET, Thursday, July 19, 2007.  Please note that an RFQ document is not available at this time.

STATEMENT OF WORK-Combat Sample Generator (COSAGE) Database Development   1.	Contract Number: GS-35F-4721G  2.	Project Background 2.1 The Center for Army Analysis (CAA) conducts theater level analytic studies for use by Headquarters, Department of the Army and other sponsors.  The primary quantitative analysis tools used in conducting these studies are combat simulation models.  At t he present time, CAA uses a two-tier approach to theater level combat simulation.  COSAGE, a high-resolution system-on-system model, is run to produce representative combat samples as output which are subsequently delivered as input to the Concepts Evaluat ion Model (CEM) and used for the theater level simulation.  Historically, both models have been developed and maintained by CAA. As the Department of the Army initiates transformation from the current force structure to the Objective Force, CAA has seized the opportunity to review, replace and/or enhance outdated models.  The Joint Integrated Contingency Model (JICM) is currently un der review as a replacement for CEMthe current theater level model.  While CAA is reviewing alternative high-resolution combat models, it is also actively engaged in enhancing the COSAGE model.  The purpose of this contract is to acquire contract programm ing and database development services support to assist CAA analysts with COSAGE data requirements. COSAGE Database Enhancements will include the migration of the current Microsoft Access databases to Microsoft SQL Server and the development of complete MS Windows-based user interfaces that allow the analysts to manage and configure the COSAGE input data . 2.2 Given the limited personnel resources of Army analytical agencies, it is expected that contract programming support services will be needed. The contractor support will be complementary to in-house capabilities and the work will be oriented to addres s specific tasks as described below in this document. 3.	Scope and Project Objectives. The scope of this project shall be limited to the migration of the current COSAGE Microsoft Access databases to Microsoft SQL Server and the development of a complete MS Windows-based user interfaces that allow the analysts to manage and configure the COSA GE input data. 4.

<SUBJECT>70--National Portfolio Management System
<DESC>Introduction This is a Request for Information (RFI) for potential sources to provide product offerings and information to VHA to help formulate options and strategies for selecting a decision support system designed to facilitate standardization of business processes for requesting, reviewing and approving the acquisition of capital assets.  Vendors should provide basic information regarding offerings and capabilities as to how they would approach the VHA to achieve this document's outlined objectives below.  Agency Name:  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Agency Overview:   The VHA is one of three organizations (the other two being the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA)) within the Veterans Administrations (VA).   The VHA is made of 21 integrated health care service networks (VISNs) that include 157 medical centers throughout the 50 states.   Capital assets include equipment (medical and non-medical) and real property, both of which are acquired in a variety of ways by local medical centers and networks that oversee their operation. Project Name:   National Portfolio Management System (NPfMS) Project Project Background:   Currently within VA/VHA, the acquisition (which include request, review and approval) of high-dollar capital assets - over $500,000 (including equipment and fixed/real assets) is centralized in the Capital Investment Program (CIP) and managed centrally/nationally via the CIP portfolio management system &amp; database.   The CIP portfolio management system is a web-based decision support tool that automates the request/review/approval process and which enables objective scoring and prioritization or equipment requirements.   Acquisitions over $500k typically must be reviewed and approved nationally before local purchases can be executed.   Within each network and medical center, a variety of local business processes, review/approval thresholds and business/data systems are used to execute the capital equipment request, review and approval process.   To date, there is no standardized business process or system to manage capital equipment requests, reviews and approvals across all medical centers and networks. Project Details:   Before an integrated business process/system solution can be developed or implemented, it is essential that VHA conduct a current state assessment of its existing business processes and systems with regards to capital asset acquisitions.   The NPfMS Project represents the initial phase in conducting that assessment and is comprised of three major components: 1.	Current state assessment of business processes, 2.	Marketplace assessment of decision support systems for acquisition of capital assets (including portfolio management systems), 3.	Stakeholder assessment to evaluate key VHA stakeholders in the capital asset request, review and approval process.    This RFI is designed to identify and provide basic information is support of Item 2. above. Based on the results of the current state assessment of business processes, stakeholder assessment, and responses to the RFI, a comprehensive assessment will be completed which will include recommendations for possible development of a standardized business process/system for managing the request, review and approval process for capital assets (i.e., an integrated portfolio management system) across all medical centers and networks.   Should a decision to move forward with an integrated process/system solution be established, a Request for Proposal (RFP) may be issued.   Should that RFP be issued, it will contain more detailed requirements for the product, contractual details, and key criteria for successful bidders. The marketplace assessment of decision support systems for acquisition of capital assets (including portfolio management systems) includes the following core categories: 1.	Strategic Alignment 2.	Process &amp; Metrics 3.	Investment Domains and Portfolios 4.	Reporting and Analytics 5.	Communication &amp; Collaboration 6.	User Interfaces 7.	Architecture, Security &amp; Cost 8.	Investment Optimization Each of these categories contains a number of specific questions that address an array of anticipated functional and operational requirements.   The specific questions are listed in the Requirements Section below. REQUIREMENTS Business background of the project:   To evaluate the feasibility of developing and deploying an integrated solution (business process and systems) that standardizes the capital asset request, review and approval process within VHA. The core categories of the marketplace assessment are provided immediately below.   Within each of these categories is a series of questions designed to obtain additional information regarding vendor offerings.   Vendor offerings should address each of the categories and associated questions therein.   Additional information associated with each category (but which may beyond the scope of the specific questions therein) should be incorporated into the vendor's response.   The vendor may also submit product information outside of the categories listed below, as well as a capability statement (which may include information such as staff expertise, consulting experience, IT systems experience, etc.).

This is a brand name only acquisition which is approved based upon the following excert from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and approval. 

Unity Unified Messaging software is developed and maintained by Cisco Systems..USSOCOM requires voicemail services to provide to  its enterprise clients.  The Cisco VoIP architecture is currently installed at HQ US SOCOM and 5 Adjunct units supporting more then 2000 garrison and deployed devices in support of the Global War on Terrorism.  To purchase the required software from any source, other than Cisco, would require the use of additional resources for testing and approving compatibility with the current network architecture.  Market surveys show that it would cost over $500,000 to replace all  equipment, at all commands with VOIP systems of lessor quality. The data is supported by market research done at vtiphonesystems.com. Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractors Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.  All quotations must be received not later than 23 July 2007, 5:00 P.M.

Instructions to Offerors 

The provision at FAR 52.212-1-- Instructions to Offerors (Jan 2005) - Commercial Items apply to this acquisition. Proposals will be evaluated on past performance, key personnel, and price and price related factors. FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan. 1999) applies. 

Evaluation Criteria and Basis For Award

The Offeror's proposal shall contain a response to each of the factors identified below. The evaluation of this proposal will be based on the Technical and Price proposals submitted by the offeror. 

FACTOR 1: PAST PEFORMANCE 

The quality of an Offeror's past performance will be evaluated based on references provided by the Offeror, information the Government obtains through reference checks, and/or from other sources (to include but not be limited to other contracting offices, the Past performance Information retrieval Systems, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)). Offerors shall provide three (3) references for requirements of similar size, scope, and complexity to the acquisition of Light Deactivation in Support of the Applicant Sales Program. Contact information, phone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses shall be provided and the offeror is responsible for ensuring accurate contact information is provided and encouraged to contact its references in advance to notify that they may be contacted by the evaluation team for this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts which are deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this procurement. The past performance section shall be limited to six (6) pages. 

FACTOR 1 EVALUATION AND SCORING STANDARDS: 

Significant confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides little doubt that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort or exceeds our requirement. 

Confidence: The Offeror's past performance record indicates the Offeror can successfully perform the required effort. 

Unknown confidence: The Offeror has no relevant performance record. A review was unable to identify any relevant past performance information. This is a neutral rating. It does not hinder nor help the Offeror. 

Little confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides substantial doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

No confidence: The Offeror's past performance record provides extreme doubt that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. 

FACTOR 2: KEY PERSONNEL Offerors will be evaluated on the ability of their key personnel to clearly demonstrate their understanding, knowledge, and experience to meet the requirements identified in this solicitation. In addition, proposed key personnel will be evaluated on their experience in past requirements. Offerors shall provide resumes which include a description of the experience and capability for the proposed key personnel. Descriptions shall address such items as the individual's background, education, work experience and accomplishments. Resumes shall also demonstrate the knowledge that key personnel have gained through completed and ongoing efforts that are similar in nature to this effort. At a minimum, the following positions will be considered key personnel: project manager, quality control manager, and technical manager. Each resume shall be limited to two (2) pages and one introductory page is allowed; therefore the key personnel section is limited to six (6) pages. 

FACTOR 2 EVALUATION AND SCORING STANDARDS: 

Superior: Offeror demonstrates excellent understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel significantly exceed performance or capability expectations. There are no significant weaknesses. 

Satisfactory: Offeror demonstrates good understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel meet the performance or capability expectations. There are no significant weaknesses. 

Marginal: Offeror demonstrates shallow understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel marginally meet performance or capability expectations necessary for minimal but acceptable contract performance. There are weaknesses that may be correctable. Continuous government oversight of the Offeror's proposed key personnel may be necessary in order to achieve performance requirements. 

Poor: Offeror fails to demonstrate understanding of the requirement and the experience and capabilities of the proposed personnel fail to meet performance or capability expectations. There are unacceptable weaknesses. Changes to the Offeror's proposed key personnel would be necessary in order to achieve performance requirements. 

FACTOR 3: PRICE AND PRICE RELATED FACTORS Offerors shall be evaluated on their ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the requirement identified within the solicitation. The proposed price will be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness, and realism as compared to Independent Government Estimate (IGE) and the prices proposed by other offerors. The offeror must reflect a clear understanding of the requirement, and must be consistent with the methods described in the offeror's proposal. There is no page limitation for the price section; however, extraneous or past performance and key personnel information included in the price section will not be evaluated.

Background:
The Harvesting Systems and Engineering Division of the NMFS Mississippi Laboratories in Pascagoula, MS has been involved with modifications to commercial fishing gear to allow commercial fishing while protecting threatened, endangered and protected marine animals. For example, the Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) have been a big part of increasing sea turtle populations, although that increase is somewhat anecdotal.  A good method to determine population estimates is needed to determine the status (endangered, threatened, or recovering) of these turtles.  Also these estimates can be used to tell whether current conservation methods are working or if new regulations need to be implemented.  Historically population estimates of sea turtles have been made by counting the adult females during nesting.  These estimates do not take into consideration the number of male turtles nor sub-adult (pre-nesters) females.  An in-water survey of sea turtles may prove to be a more accurate method of estimating sea turtle populations.  One method of doing an in-water survey could be accomplished by sample trawling using shrimp trawls.  Unfortunately this method puts sea turtles at risk of drowning and is inefficient due to having to make short duration tows.  Researchers feel that observational surveys are preferable to capture methods and video observations work well when water conditions allow.  Unfortunately, water conditions are often poor particularly in some areas with high turtle concentrations.  Two areas that are well known for high sea turtle concentrations are Cape Canaveral, FL and Brunswick, GA.  Turtles are common near the Cape Canaveral ship channel, but that water has a deep green cast and is often very turbid and in Brunswick ship channel the water is muddy and turbid.  Additionally, we NOAA has trawling operations during the night and underwater lights often do a poor job of illuminating the subject and often affect the behavior of marine organisms.  Also, there are depth limitations with video cameras due to lower light levels at depth and cable length restrictions.  At present with cabled video cameras we are limited to trawling at depths no deeper than 100 feet.  Therefore sonar is a better observational tool than video in that water visibility and light level have no effect on image quality.





Projects Making Use of the Equipment:

In-Water Turtle Surveys ? (Miami FL, Laboratory sponsors this system) it will be used for in-water surveys of wild sea turtles.  Other methods of counting turtles such as nesting surveys are lacking in that males and sub-adult females do not get counted.

Dolphin/Shrimp Trawl Interactions ? (Southeast Regional Office Sponsor) there have been a few occurrences of dolphins drowning in shrimp trawls in the Southeast Atlantic.  The drowning occurred by dolphins going inside the net and from entanglement on the lazy line.  A way to monitor dolphin interactions are need to determine how these drowning occurred.  The DIDSON will allow us to see how dolphins interact with the trawl and make needed modifications to the trawl or the fishing methods to prevent further encounters.

TED Research and Certification Tests ? TED certification tests are conducted once a year during June in Panama City, FL.  Often additional testing is needed during the year using wild turtles.  Known concentrations of wild turtles are known off of the Georgia coast and the Florida coast around Cape Canaveral, both areas are also know for poor water clarity, thus the DIDSON would be a better tool for this research then videotaping.

Bycatch Reduction Research ? The DIDSON would be a useful tool in studying the ways that fish react to being caught inside of a trawl, this information would help to figure out how to exclude unwanted catch.  Additionally sharks can be a nuisance to shrimp trawlers and understanding how sharks interact with the codend could lead to a solution keeps sharks away.

Fish Trawler Research ? TEDs regulations appear to be coming for fish trawlers in the Mid-Atlantic region.  A way to mitigate fish lose with the TEDs is greatly needed the DIDSON will be a useful tool in determining fish behavior in these trawls.

Brand Name Justification:
The DIDSON (Dual Frequency Identification Sonar) system is a unique product which uses a new sonar technology and is designed to provide high resolution images in turbid or low visibility waters.  The DIDSON system can be used where optical systems tend to fail because sonar signals are not affected by water clarity or light levels as are optical systems.  The DIDSON system gives sonar images that are similar to video images.  Another limitation to current video systems is water depth.  Current video systems require wire leads to allow real-time monitoring which limit the depth range due to the amount of video cable needed for the operation.  The DIDSON system can operate with a battery pack which allows for autonomous deployment eliminating the need for video cables in situations when the use of cables is not feasible.

All currently available sonar systems have been evaluated at trade shows and the DIDSON system is the only sonar system that NOAA NMFS Mississippi Laboratories is aware of that produces the detailed, high resolution image that is necessary to support its research.  Other sonar systems created a good image of stationary objects but were not meant to be used for observing moving objects such as marine organisms.

<DESC>Purpose and Objective

The National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) requires a well-trained medical or scientific professional to provide recommendations, that shall be advisory in nature, and to provide oversight for three Protocol Review Committees (PRC) and one Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Observational Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB/OSMB) that serve the RDCRN.  The NCRR currently oversees 6 PRCs and 2 DSMB/OSMBs that provide independent review of protocols and independent safety and data monitoring of all ongoing studies.  The Contractor will server as the Executive Secretary of the three PRCs and 1 DSMB/OSMB.


CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

This position requires experience in clinical research and protocol design/development as well as highly developed scientific and administrative skills.  Timely handling of responsibilities is required as tight timelines are in place for the scientific review of protocols by outside reviewers on PRCs and timely oversight by DSMB/OSMB is required to assure the safety of the participants in RDCRN studies.  This may include emergency meetings to address emerging safety concerns or occurrence of serious adverse events.  Thus, the time commitment must allow flexibility.  The number of studies within the network is large and requires careful planning and attention to monitoring schedules even in the absence of need for emergency review. 

Significant skill in the management of groups and individuals is required to assure the smooth functioning of the 4 committees.  Some committees may require monthly meetings but no less frequently than quarterly meetings will be required.  Careful documentation of identified conflicts of interest and management is required to prevent contamination of the independent review process.  Meticulous recording of actions is required as well as timely implementation. 

The contractor shall review submitted protocols to assess the need for additional reviewer expertise above that available on the standing committees based on the scientific, ethical, or unique statistical issues of the protocol.  If additional expertise is needed, the contractor shall make recommendations to the NCRR PRC-DSMB/OSMB Coordinator for obtaining that expertise.  The contractor shall also be responsible for making recommendations for new members of committees or for needed turn over in committee. 

The contractor shall be responsible for drafting after each meeting a summary document for the file and a draft memorandum that conveys the recommendations of the committee to the study team for each study.  Drafts must be approved by NCRR and the Chair of the Committee. After approval, the contractor as Executive Secretary of the Committee shall convey the memo to the designated recipients.  

The contractor shall be responsible for establishing a meeting date, time, and duration of each meeting.  The RDCRN Data and Technology Coordinating Center will survey members for appropriate dates if requested and provide that input to the Contractor.  However, the ultimate responsibility for establishing a meeting data and time is that of the contractor.  This meeting must include the majority of members and in all cases the expertise required and the involvement of the appropriate members of the protocol team or their delegates, and appropriate NIH staff.  

Level of Effort:

The level of effort required by this contract is based on an hourly rate for services of a scientific or medical professional to provide the required services.  The number of hours is not to exceed 1,040 hours over a twelve (12) month period.  The total effort, in labor hours, will be reported monthly and serve as a basis for payment.  

The contractor shall possess an professional degree and have clinical research and review experience.  In addition, the contractor shall have the required administrative, personal, and attention to detail required for this position.

<DESC>NASA LaRC plans to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements for Aerospace Fasteners in accordance with FAR 13.303-1 and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items Procedures, and intends to simplify the acquisition of repetitive purchase of fasteners which generally have short response times to meet critical research project requirements. While the majority of calls or orders will be under $5,000.00 some orders will exceed $25,000.00. Because some of these orders meet the synopsis exemption for urgency (FAR 5.502(a)(2)), individual actions may not be synopsized. Therefore, interested parties are urged to respond to this announcement. NASA LaRC may resolicit for additional BPA sources on a regular basis. Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures and references.  The list of requirements sets forth the range of fasteners required. Vendors do not need to meet the delivery requirements of all fasteners listed in the requirements document but should clearly detail their individual capabilities in their response using the Fastener availability schedule on Pages 2 and 3 of the solicitation. Responses should also include: name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are small , small disadvantaged, 8(a) Hubzone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business, affiliate information: parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential subcontract) or subcontractors (if potential prime ); list of customers over the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, and point of contact-address and phone number). Procurement and Technical questions should be directed to Richard J. Siebels at Richard.J.Siebels@nasa.gov or (757) 862-2418.  A completed BPA package shall be submitted to Richard J. Siebels no later than July 27, 2007. Please reference NNL07AEROFAST in any response. Any reference notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

i.Development.
This contract encompasses all activities necessary to sustain the current portable media product FED LOG (Federal Logistics Data) and to develop an upgraded, adaptive and more capable method to deliver information via portable media for use in U.S. Military and other Government logistics operations and supply chain management.
Customers Needs. Sustaining the current FED LOG product is necessary due to its support of legacy systems using older technologies such as Microsoft Disk Operating System (DOS).  These computing environments are several years old; therefore older technologies must remain on the product.  As older systems are replaced, they are replaced with current technologies.  The Government recognizes that the current production method and product can be significantly improved using these newer technologies.  For this reason, this contract will be progressive while remaining relevant throughout its award period.  The contract identifies these growth areas as options, which are detailed in Section C.10.

Product.The basic requirement under this contract covers development, production and delivery of FED LOG.  Other portable media products may be developed using the options specified in this contract at the discretion of the Government.

Unlimited Rights The Contractor shall provide unlimited rights to the Government for all configuration items developed as part of this contract.  The Government will pay no additional fees such as, but not limited to, royalties, license fees, per-click fees, or usage fees for the products, software, firmware, hardware or applications developed under this contract.  These limitations shall also apply to any Government furnished items delivered to the selected service provider as basis for constructing configuration items delivered under this contract.
BACKGROUND DLIS Mission The Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) is a component activity of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLIS provides logistics information and Information Technology (IT) solutions for the Military Services, other Defense Department and Federal Agencies, Government Contractors, private industry and international partners to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain management.  DLIS delivers information to customers in a variety of media and formats based on the customers? data requirements and IT and network resources and capabilities.
Definition of Portable Media 
Portable media are digital storage products that store large amounts of data and are easily added to and removed from a computing device.  Examples of portable media include Compact Disc Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM), Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) and flash drives.  Permanently installed hard drives are not portable media.
Mission Need for Portable Media On May 9, 2003, the DoD Chief Information Officer issued the ?DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy? which emphasizes network delivery of information.  DLIS supports this strategy through a number of web-based applications.  However, the U.S. Military operates in environments where access to networks is limited, compromised, degraded or nonexistent.  In these instances portable media products containing databases and data views, combined with robust access tools, play an essential role in assuring operational success.  Portable media products augment the DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy by adding a ?take with? component.
Current DLIS Portable Media Products Federal Logistics Information (FED LOG) on Portable Media is the primary product produced and delivered by DLIS.  FED LOG has been produced by the Defense Logistics Information Services since 1992.  It provides logistics information on CD-ROM and DVD.  Information includes management data, part numbers, reference numbers, and information about suppliers, freight, packaging, and interchangeable parts from the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS).  FLIS is the enterprise database for item-related data for the Federal Government.  In addition to FLIS, FED LOG provides item-related data unique to the military services.  Attachment A provides details about the FED LOG product.

FED LOG runs in multiple environments including Microsoft Disk Operating System (DOS) 16-bit technology, Windows 3.1 or greater, and UNIX.  FED LOG can operate on an individual workstation or on a network server to support multiple users.FED LOG operates in six modes: a.	Interactive.  The FED LOG product includes a custom-built rich client that provides the means for users to enter searches and receive responses interactively.b.Batch. This mode provides users the capability to input one or more inquiries, import a file, extract and store response data.
c.Image Extractor.  This mode extracts National Item Identification Numbers (NIINs) and associated images (i.e., photographs).  Extraction is based on a NIIN, an input file of NIINs, FSC, item name, or the extraction of all images.
d.Tools.  This mode provides a library of C/C++ functions that allows programmers to create custom applications to search data on FED LOG.  The Tools mode supports Windows DOS, 16-bit, and 32-bit applications and UNIX applications.e.System-to-disk interfaces.  This mode includes special applications, built using FED LOG Tools, designed to meet the requirements of systems interfacing with FED LOG.f.Internet.  This mode provides client access to a remote server that contains the current month?s version of data and a historical archive dating back to 1992.

Attachment B provides information about other DLIS portable media products.  Many of these products provide a subset of FLIS data delivered on FED LOG.

Current Production Capabilities The current FED LOG application is built by a collection of conversion programs that reformat incoming data, consolidate it and apply a custom optimization process that transforms certain parts of the input data to special binary codes to reduce its size. There are about 135 programs that contribute to the construction of this CD-based database.  FED LOG then applies a custom index structure to the CD as well and includes a viewing and searching application.  The production system works, but has evolved over a fifteen year period with many additions and changes, making it difficult to maintain.  The Government will furnish Government-owned software used in producing FED LOG to the selected service provider.  This software does not include the proprietary compression and indexing software used by the current service provider.

All other portable media products are mastered using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software. Prototype Production Capability
DLIS recognized the process used to publish FED LOG could be improved through the application of new methods. A market survey, conducted in 2004, concluded that there were no COTS available that could update the production architecture, and recommended a development project. The survey identified data compression and search-and-retrieval performance, as the highest risks.  To address these risks, DLIS issued a contract for a prototype effort.  This effort demonstrated a capability that would provide a ?production line? method to produce not only FED LOG but other products as well.  The prototype included the use of a data mart to structure data for simple SQL queries, the use of open source (including JRE, JBOSS, Tomcat, Enterprise Java Beans, and XML), and declarative web application technology.  The Government will provide components developed as a result of this effort to the selected service provider as a basis upon which to develop the new production capability solicited under this contract.

Line Item 0001:  One (1) Lot, Corrosive Turbomolecular Pump with Rotary Vane Backing Pump

BACKGROUND	
The Process Sensing Group intends to purchase a turbomolecular pump with rotary vane backing pump for an existing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system that is used to fabricate thin film chemical sensing layers.  This pumping package is intended to be mounted on an existing CVD vacuum system.  This CVD system produces metal-oxide thin-films by means of thermal decomposition of metal-organic starting materials (or precursors).  These metal-organic precursors produce corrosive byproducts, which must be adequately removed by the pumping package.  The corrosion problem is exacerbated by the fact that the CVD vacuum system is a ?batch tool.?  Batch tools are systems that are vented directly to atmosphere, allowing water (humidity-generated) to enter the deposition chamber during sample/device loading and unloading.  Therefore, both the turbomolecular pump and the rotary vane backing pump must be corrosion resistant.  


The Contractor shall meet or exceed the following minimum technical specifications:

The turbomolecular pump is required to achieve a system base pressure of five times ten to the negative eighth Torr.  This base pressure level indicates a minimum amount of water in the system.  We must minimize the amount of water because water reacts with our precursors, causing excessive variability in the final thin-films produced.   

The 2-stage rotary vane pump is required for safely pumping away excess CVD precursors and their associated byproducts.  The 2-stages are required because the processing pressure is in the 10 to the negative 3rd power Torr range.  A single stage pump cannot deliver this level of performance.

Listed below are the specific requirements for both the turbomolecular pump and the 2-stage rotary vane pump, as dictated by our CVD process.

Turbopump:

Pumping Speed/Compression of Semi-Mag/Lev Turbomolecular Pump
	
			     Hydrogen - 	480 L/Sec           5 x 10 to the 6 power
			     Helium   - 		500 L/Sec           5 x 10 to the 7 power
			     Nitrogen -	 	500 L/Sec           Greater than 10 to the 12 power
	
		(These pumping speeds for the listed gases are required to overcome the Conductance of the current CVD system.  Also, the higher the compression ratio the better the turbopump can remove water.  It is imperative that water be removed because the chemical precursors used to produce the metal-oxide thin-films react with water.  If the amount of water varies, so will the resultant thin-film.  Having reproducible thin-film products is required for the project.)
	
		    	 DN 160 CF-F inlet.  (The required flange shall mate with existing CVD system.)
	
	Corrosion resistant
Ceramic lubricated bearing must be field replaceable by operators' personnel without removing the rotor/stator package.  Bearings must be located at the two ends of the rotor with the top bearing being of the magnetic variety.

(A magnetic bearing is required in order to minimize cross-contamination when using different metal-organic precursors.  Typically, some turbopumps employ two oil bearings.  These oil bearings absorb the chemical precursors delivered to the system.  These precursors thermally decompose, due to the friction encountered at typical turbo rotor rotational speeds, creating corrosive gases and abrasive particles.  The required turbopump will have one inert gas-purged, oil bearing.  The purge gas keeps the one oil bearing clean while not adversely affecting the overall pumping efficiency, as would be the case when purging two oil bearings.)

Turbopump blades must be designed so the pump can withstand sudden inrush of atmosphere at full rotational speed on the inlet or exhaust.  

(This is required in case of system breech while under vacuum.  Otherwise, the turbopump will be irreparably damaged.)
	
Turbopump must include an integrated molecular drag stage so the pump can exhaust to a pressure of 16mbar, and reach an ultimate pressure less than one times ten to the negative ninth mbar with a diaphragm roughing pump.  Pump can operate with an inlet pressure of 0.1mbar continuously.   Maximum throughput of 960sccm for N2.

(This is required in order to handle CVD precursor delivery as well as expelling the bearing purge gas.)
	
Turbopump must be able to be mounted in horizontal or vertical position. 

(Due to space limitations, the orientaion position must be flexible.)
	
Programmable, delayed vent valve to vent the turbopump when the rotational speed drops to roughly 50 percent of nominal, or a time delay, as well as being disabled.   Venting between the turbopump compression stages above the last rotor stage to eliminate contamination caused by venting into the fore vacuum area.

(The foreline must be kept clean to avoid cross-contamination.)
	
Bearing MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) of less than 100,000 hours.  

2-stage Rotary Vane Pump:  

Must be oxygen and corrosion resistant.  (The CVD system to which the rotary vane backing pump is for produces metal-oxide thin-films by means of thermal decomposition of metal-organic starting materials (or precursors).  These metal-organic precursors produce corrosive byproducts, which must be adequately removed by the pumping package.  The corrosion problem is exacerbated by the fact that the CVD vacuum system is a ?batch tool.?  Batch tools are systems that are vented directly to atmosphere, allowing water (humidity-generated) to enter the deposition chamber during sample/device loading and unloading.  Therefore, the rotary vane backing pump must be corrosion resistant.)

Vacuum safety valve.  

(Required safety feature in case of power failure.)

Magnetic coupling of the drive to the pump.

(Required safety feature.  There are no drive shaft seals with magnetic coupling.  Therefore, oil cannot leak out of the pump.  This pump oil will be exposed to CVD precursors, which are toxic.)

Pumping speed of 12m3/hr (7cfm) minimum.  

(Required pumping speed to handle CVD precursor/carrier gas flow.)

Use perfluoropolyether lubricant (a.k.a. Krytox 1514/F4 oil).

(Required for chemical inertness, hence addressing safety as well as minimizing cross-contamination from back-streaming reaction products into the vacuum deposition system.)

The system offered for CLIN 0001 must meet or exceed the following salient characteristics to be considered technically acceptable: 

One component of the mission of the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory (MSEL), Polymers Division (PD), Biomaterials Group (BG) is to develop methods for noninvasive imaging of biological systems.   NIST MSEL PD BG requires an upright, optical microscope to be used as an integral part of a unique high speed, 2 channel optical coherence and two photon fluorescence microscope that will be used for in-situ, non-invasive studies of cell growth and tissue generation in tissue scaffolds for regenerative medicine.

Specifications: There are several technical requirements that are crucial to this instrument:

1.	The choice of microscope objective is critical for this application. Because two-photon excitation is occurring, the objective should have a 20X magnification, high numerical aperture >0.90, and be water immersion for biological systems. To maximize signal, light transmission should be at least 50% the entire range from (500 to 1000) nm and a chart of percent transmission versus wavelength in this range must be provided.  Because we will be imaging three dimensional samples with thicknesses greater than 1 mm, a large working distance (>1.5 mm) is required. An imaging bioreactor will be used, and a cover slip correction of #1.5 (0.17) mm is needed to be compatible with the bioreactor window. The field of view should be large, having a field number of at least 20. The objective must be infinity corrected to be compatible with the optical train design. 
2.	The microscope shall be upright and the x,y stages (having at least 50 mm travel) will carry a maximum 8 lb load. Therefore, the objective will be mounted to the z stage to provide vertical translation of the focus. The z stage will have a 25 mm travel and have a resolution of greater than 20 nm and a maximum velocity of 3 mm/s.
3.	The intensity of the near infrared (NIR) beam going into the microscope is being modulated by an interferometer. This requires that the beam be introduced as close to the objective as possible and not through a conventional port on the microscope housing. The port for introducing the NIR beam shall be no more than 20 mm from the back aperture of the objective. Also, there shall be 18 to 20 mm clearance between the top of the objective z stage and the rest of the microscope housing for mounting of additional optics for beam steering.
4.	Because of requirements 2 and 3, there will be a gap between the top of the objective z stage and the rest of the microscope housing.
5.	The microscope must have the following five ports:
a.	An intermediate type dual port for mounting the eyepiece, charge coupled device (CCD) video camera and photomultiplier (PMT) tube.
b.	A port for halogen illumination on the back of the housing. 
c.	One for NIR beam in and out as described in requirement 3.

CLIN 0003, On-Site Training for Up to Three NIST Personnel for Normal Use of CLIN 0001; Quantity: 1; Unit: Job.

INSTALLATION AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CLIN 0001:

The Contractor must install the system and perform acceptance testing on the Olympus Model BX61WI Custom Motorized Research Microscope.    

Installation and acceptance testing shall occur within seven (7) days after the system is received by NIST Shipping and Receiving.   This acceptance testing must be performed in the presence of the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) to verify that all installed items are fully operational and operate as intended by the original equipment manufacturer.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial supplies prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.     This is a Request For Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is F2VUJ0155AC03. The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following items: 5 each brand name only Cisco Catalyst Upgrades. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17 effective 15 May 2007, DFAR DCN 20070531, and AFFAR AFAC 20070531. Fed Biz Ops Numbered Notes per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Apply: 12, 13, 29. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS), 334111 Electronic Computer Manufacturing. The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) is 3571 , Computers Merchant Wholesalers. The proposed contract is set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns. Offers from other than Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns will not be considered. A firm fixed price contract will be awarded. All interested parties must bid on all items.
DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:

This acquisition is a brand name only requirement based upon the excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.

The USSOCOM Enterprise Network is entirely Cisco.  Introduction of additional vendors into the enterprise to rectify this requirement would require additional testing and interoperability evaluation, as well increase the total cost of ownership (TCO) through additional training, maintenance contracts and interoperability engineering.  Under the terms of the current support contract, the Government is responsible for providing EITC contractors with training on any equipment introduced to the network infrastructure outside that which was originally specified.  The cost of training alone would be $3,500 a week for a training class and travel, plus a contractor labor cost of $2,880 per week.  Training just 4 contractor for 4 weeks on any alternative equipment would cost the Government more then $100,000 in addition to the purchase price of the equipment.  Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition. 

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.

The 6th Contracting Squadron, MacDill AFB, Florida, requires the following items: 5 each brand name only Cisco Catalyst Upgrades. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17 effective 15 May 2007, DFAR DCN 20070531, and AFFAR AFAC 20070531. Fed Biz Ops Numbered Notes per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Apply: 12, 13, 29. The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS), 334111 Electronic Computer Manufacturing.

This acquisition is a brand name only requirement based upon the excerpt from the Contracting Officer signed Justification and Approval.

The USSOCOM Enterprise Network is entirely Cisco.  Introduction of additional vendors into the enterprise to rectify this requirement would require additional testing and interoperability evaluation, as well increase the total cost of ownership (TCO) through additional training, maintenance contracts and interoperability engineering.  Under the terms of the current support contract, the Government is responsible for providing EITC contractors with training on any equipment introduced to the network infrastructure outside that which was originally specified.  The cost of training alone would be $3,500 a week for a training class and travel, plus a contractor labor cost of $2,880 per week.  Training just 4 contractor for 4 weeks on any alternative equipment would cost the Government more then $100,000 in addition to the purchase price of the equipment.  Without this brand name procurement, there would be a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through full and open competition. 

Award will be made to the quotation which offers the best value to the government. Multiple awards may be accomplished if any items are determined to be unbalanced. The Government also reserves the right to make no award at all.

These comments may include but are not limited to quality of construction, clarity and completeness of operator or technical manuals, ease of use / user interface, etc.  

Once all technical issues are resolved, a technical evaluation report will be prepared and forwarded to the contracting officer for consideration in determining the best value award.       
Past Performance/Factor 2 (As Important as Technical Proposal)
The proposal must contain the names of government or private corporation clients to whom they have provided the same system, within the last 3 years. 
Price/Factor 3 (Least Important)
The cost proposal shall contain supporting documentation of the price proposed such as a commercial price list in order to determine price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.  Although price is not the controlling factor in award of a contract under this solicitation; it is an important factor and should not be ignored.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of the equality of the proposals in terms of the other evaluation factors on which selection is based.  If competing proposals are substantially equal in technical and past performance, price may be the determining factor in award.  
Exclusion of any of this information may cause the proposal to be excluded from consideration.
(b)  Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s)
(c)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer?s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (Dec 2003)
(a)  Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.  		
(b)  Definitions.  As used in this clause:  
?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.
?Foreign Incorporated Entity? means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
?Inverted Domestic Corporation.?  A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)
(1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation of substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held ? 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
?Person?, ?domestic?, and ?foreign? have the meaning given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4) and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1)  Certain Stock Disregarded.  For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b) (1) of Section 8935 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2)  Plan Deemed In Certain Cases.  If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3)  Certain Transfers Disregarded.  The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contributions or distributions) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.  
(d)  Special Rule for Related Partnerships.  For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the means of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e)  Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(1) warrants;
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) other similar interests
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure
By signing and submitting its offer, an offor under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.
(g)  if a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 			(End of provision)
