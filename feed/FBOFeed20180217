<DESC><br />Noxious Weed Spraying Services on Three Rivers and Republic Ranger Districts, Colville National Forest
<p><br />The Republic and Three Rivers Ranger Districts on the Colville National Forest proposes to contract for herbicide treatment of noxious weeds during the winter of 2017/2018. Location of the work is in Stevens and Ferry Counties, Washington (located in the NE portion of Washington State). Work will vary in locations throughout the two Districts.</p>
<p>Backpack, ATV/UTV and truck spraying methods will be required. Work will vary in locations throughout the two Districts.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, tools, transportation and supplies to complete the job. Contractor shall furnish all herbicide. Contractor shall be licensed by the State of Washington as a Commercial Operator with the ability to apply herbicide on public land.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contract with a base year and two one-year option periods (for Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019). Currently, the Government is estimating one award to be made. The ceiling price for all three years is currently estimated at $210,000. However, the actual amount will be listed in the solicitation. Price will be quoted by the acre and mile depending on the line item.</p>
<p>Task orders will be placed based on site conditions, prices listed in the contract and funding availability.</p>
<p>Work in the field is estimated from May 15th through October 15th depending on weather and site locations. The Contractor will be paid for actual work ordered, performed and accepted by the Government (more information will be listed in the solicitation).</p>
<p>This procurement requires the use of biobased products to the extent that such products are reasonably available, meet agency or relevant industry performance standards, and are reasonably prices. Where available, these products would first be acquired from among qualified products that fall under the umbrella of items designated through the Federal Biobased Products Preferred Procurement Program (FB4P).</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a written request for quotes (RFQ) under the simplified acquisition procedures. The procurement is considered under the commercial test program. Estimated issue date of the solicitation is on or about February 17, 2018. The solicitation will be posted electronically at this (FedBizOpps) site when it issues. The actual quote due date will be listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The project is a 100 percent small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 115310 and Size Standard is $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be posted at the site on the issue date.</p>
<p><br />Notes:</p>
<p>Funding for this requirement is currently not available, but is anticipated for this fiscal year 2018. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the solicitation's closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror/quoter for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>The reason for the notice to be issued this time of year is to allow for potential quoters to visit the units this fall to ascertain the extent of work involved and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the prices to the extent the information is obtainable and while the sites are still accessible. Some changes from this notice may occur from the actual solicitation, but the enclosed information is a representative of work to be done.</p>
<p>In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after the contract has been awarded (reference FAR Clause 52.237-1). No guided tours will be held. For information about site locations, please call Travis Fletcher at the Republic Ranger District. His number is 509.775.7424.</p>
<p>The Government assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representation concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of a contract, unless such understanding or representation the Government is expressly stated in a subsequent solicitation and contract.</p>
<p>All inquiries concerning this potential project must be directed to me a 509.684.7114 or fax 509.684.7280. You may also e-mail me at cvanalyne@fs.fed.us.</p>
