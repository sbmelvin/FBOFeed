<CONTACT>ANN MANNING CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3034452433     AMANNING@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a sole source procurement to the National Academy of Sciences (quasi Government agency) to execute an independent study to evaluate technical concerns addressing ductile iron pipe coatings identified in Table 2 of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Technical Memorandum 8140-CC-2004-1. The 2003 House Committee on Appropriations Report directed Reclamation to study its corrosion criteria. After an extensive review of technical/performance data and review by an independent consultant review panel, Reclamation published its findings and recommendations in Technical Memorandum No. 8140-CC-2004-1, "Corrosion Considerations for Buried Metallic Water Pipe", dated July, 2004 and is now seeking an independent review of the recommendations regarding ductile iron pipe contained therein. The Government believes that only one responsible source can execute the scope and direction of this study. A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition. Firms believing they can provide similar requirements must provide supporting evidence to that effect in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement. This is not a request for competitive quotes. All responses received within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning, Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer. Responses should include the firm's DUN and Bradstreet number (DUNS) and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Firms should identify themselves as either small business, or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for (NAICS) Code 541690 which is $6.5 Million. This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

The hardware solution above was analyzed and tested for interoperability against other solution sets with existing Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be both the best technical solution and value. All testing was based on predetermined Department requirements. Wholesale changes in equipment type will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthy retesting, configuration, and design. The department will also not realize a Return on investment in this product which will lead to a non standardized environment for a solution that requires cross platform consistency. Additionally, Changes in design will place unnecessary risk to the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to the lengthy process of placing new equipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterprise use.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as the only suitable candidate available in the market today meeting Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  Furthermore, the equipment is listed on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts.  Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems.  Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements. GITM Procurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Brand name only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justification with the posting.  The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6.     The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only.  GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable.  The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall the best value.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This requirement is set-aside for small business only.  The NAICS Code for this synopsis/solicitation is 541712, Size Standard 500.  Solicitation/Purchase Request number F2KBAD8017A002 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).  

This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  Fac 2005-24, Effective 28 Feb 2008

(CLIN 0001) Task 1: Calibration of Finishing Process. (CLIN 0002) Task 2: Examination of Different Fiber Volumes. Task 3: Examination of Different Reinforcing Fibers. Task 4: Examination of Alternative Resins. Task 5: Examination of Varying Thicknesses. 

AFRL/RVSV is executing an in-house program to develop high strain composite materials.  The current approach is to use high performance composite fibers in a flexible, very high strain resin system.  AFRL/RVSV would like to contract out the fabrication of composite coupons to AFRL specifications.  Fabrication of the coupons requires unique fiber coating (sizing) technologies to ensure proper bonding between the fiber and the resin.  Offering companies should be able to calibrate a sizing for high performance fibers and a high strain resin system.  AFRL/RVSV requests an initial coupon that is a single ply plate, approximately 0.010" thick, with unidirectional fibers.  Plate dimensions should be such that five 1"x12" coupons can be cut from it.  A fiber volume fraction of 40-50% is required.  The fiber should be a high strain fiber such as T800, T1000, AS4, IM7 or similar.  The resin should be elastomeric and capable of greater than 100% strain, preferably 200-300%.  There is no resin stiffness requirement.  As with all high quality composite parts, the fibers need to be well distributed, thoroughly wetted out and strongly bonded to the resin.  AFRL/RVSV may also require additional coupons with a) 10-20% decrease in fiber volume fraction, b) alternate fiber, c) alternate resin, or d) alternate thickness.  AFRL/RVSV intends to purchase at least the initial coupon.  Upon review, AFRL/RVSV will decide if its in-house development program requires purchase of additional coupons and AFRL/RVSV will specify which of the stated modifications is required

It is pressumed that this IDIQ will be sole sourced to Wheeler Power Systems as they have been the only company identified with full capabilities as per the PWS.  Please contact Jeremy Bodin with any questions.

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services, Acquisition and Procurement Office anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price DESIGN-BUILD contract for an auto-activated smoke management/containment system.   The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis.   The dollar magnitude for this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.    The performance period is thirty (30) months.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238220.  A DRAFT statement of work/solicitation will be posted for industry comment.

Requirement includes:  Design and build a system which would inhibit the flow of smoke into areas of egress, corridors, stairwells and the inner roadway.

The smoke control system would function during the period of personnel evacuation from the areas protected by the system. Moreover, this system would facilitate search and rescue operations by emergency response personnel. 

Due to the sensitive nature of the work location, prospective contractors are required to possess an active SECRET facility clearance at the time of proposal submission.  All members of the Contractor's design team must have, at minimum, a SECRET security clearance.  All personnel seeking a permanent badge must be US citizens and also possess a SECRET security clearance.  The geographic location of the work to be performed is southern Pennsylvania near the Maryland border.

NOTICE TO OFFERORS:      THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source award to QinetiQ, Inc. (the U.S. branch of QinetiQ, Ltd.), 1215 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 1102, Arlington, VA 22202-4344 for the purchase of up to  six (6) each Advanced Reconnaissance System (ARS) devices, to include upgraded cameras and optics.  The ARS device's camera and optics package, along with its interface to the system it is installed on are based upon proprietary information developed by QinetiQ.  Sole proprietorship restrictions are specific to the problem of producing an image sensor that meets the required environmental and size constraints imposed by the system integration.  In a cooperative effort, UK?s QinetiQ Ltd. created the "periscope" camera system, while the periscope control unit and supporting software was created in the United States. The basis for this cooperative development effort was the Information Exchange Annex (IEA) D-00-UK-0201, established 20 Apr!  il, 2000 between the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (UK MoD), to the US-UK Master Information Exchange Memorandum of Understanding (MIEM) between the Secretary of State for Defence of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States of America, effective 18 November, 1994.   Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition.  Delivery will be made to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018.  FSC Code:  5999  NAICS Code:  3344119, Small Business Size Standard: 500 employees.  The award will be based on an acceptable proposal on or about 15 May 2008.

<DESC>Request for Information: Collaborative Technology Tools and Methods for Distributed, Interdisciplinary Science The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) is soliciting information on ways to enhance its use of collaborative technologies for conducting distributed interdisciplinary research in astrobiology. NAI is seeking information from those with insight on ways to improve the use and impact of these technologies across the Institute, and with expertise on the social, technical, and other barriers to their adoption. The NAI is requesting information on state-of-the-art tools and methods, as well as promising new technologies, that may help the NAI further achieve its mission now and into the future. Background The NASA Astrobiology Institute was created in 1998 as a ?virtual? institute to connect geographically dispersed teams of scientists conducting interdisciplinary research in astrobiology?the study of the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.  The inherent interdisciplinarity of astrobiology requires that scientists collaborate across a wide range of disciplines in the astronomical, geological, and biological sciences.  Thus connecting scientists across disciplines as well as over distance is central to the goals of the NAI.  The diversity of collaboration within the NAI is facilitated through electronic and telecommunications networking; frequent personnel exchanges; mutual participation in field investigations; and ongoing workshops, seminars, and courses, many conducted by means of collaborative technologies. The Mission of the NASA Astrobiology Institute and its Member Investigators is to advance the field of astrobiology by: ? carrying out, supporting, and catalyzing collaborative interdisciplinary research in astrobiology; ? training the next generation of astrobiology researchers; ? providing scientific and technical leadership on astrobiology investigations for current and future space missions; ? exploring new approaches using modern information technology to conduct interdisciplinary and collaborative research amongst widely-distributed investigators; and ? supporting Education and Public Outreach by providing scientific content for K-14 education programs, teaching undergraduate classes, and communicating directly with the public. A large volume of reference material is available at the Institute's website, http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ssb/	    .  This assessment is a valuable source of insight into the Institute and its future.  Responders should pay particular attention to the NRC?s recommendations in Section 5 of the Assessment, entitled ?Use of Information Technology?. Information Requested The NAI requests information in the following areas: ? The innovative use of state-of-the art and emerging collaborative technologies and methods for scientific research. Examples of technologies that are of interest include: immersive environments, virtual and mirror worlds, supercomputing, high-speed networking, and high-resolution image displays. The NAI seeks information on current, state-of-the-art tools and methods and their best near-term application to NAI's activities, and information on tools and techniques that are on the horizon and likely to become available within the next 5-10 years.  ? The use of collaborative technologies and methods to facilitate communication. The NAI requests information on state-of-the-art and emerging collaboration tools for connecting people and research groups across distance. This may include new and innovative uses of existing tools (such as videoconferencing, WebEx, podcasting, etc.), and/or new emerging applications and technologies. The NAI seeks information on success and failure modes for distributed teams, and how this information may be used to the Institute's benefit. Information is sought on best practices in combining virtual communication with face-to-face interactions to maximize productivity. Information is requested on ways in which collaborative tools such as social networking applications can be used to support communication, the generation and furthering of ideas, the discussion and refinement of existing theories and lines of research, and the sharing of research results.  In addition, the NAI seeks information on ways in which collaborative tools may be used to expand the boundaries of the NAI to include researchers in the broader astrobiology community.  Information on fostering and supporting a participatory group of "emeritus" NAI researchers (i.e. those who have formerly been members of NAI teams but who are no longer on teams), is sought, as are new and innovative ways to structure and implement the NAI?s large, membership-wide General Meetings (200-500 people) using collaborative technologies to include broader community attendance.  ? The use of collaborative tools and techniques to lower operating costs. The NAI requests information and ideas on cost savings that might be achieved through the use of modern technology. For example, the NAI seeks ideas on implementing meetings that simulate as closely as possible the interactions in face-to-face meetings, so that travel costs can be reduced. The NAI is not seeking to build new tools, but to make the best use of existing and emerging technologies.  Although all comments received will be carefully reviewed and considered for inclusion in a later action, the Government makes no commitment to include any particular recommendations. All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  NASA will likely provide proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party proprietary information in confidence.	Data marked as non-proprietary will be shared with the NAI Executive Council (the Principal Investigators of the NAI teams), and may be made publicly available.  By submitting a response to this RFI, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors, and to release of non-proprietary information publicly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. It is possible that a solicitation will follow this RFI.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.

Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents.

NIAID intends to award a five-year contract with five (5) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals. The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on or about April 4, 2008 from www.fedbizopps.gov. No hard copies will be distributed. All questions must be submitted in writing to Alexander Kramer (kramera@niaid.nih.gov).

<DESC>***************** Send all correspondace to Elizabeth Mudler/DFS at elizabeth.e.mudler@nasa.gov or via fax at 256-544-4401******************** NASA/MSFC has a requirement for VIC-3D Digital Image Correlation System. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Correlated Solutions, Inc. on a sole source basis.  This procurement is for seven (7) complete Correlated Solutions Video Image Correlation (VIC) Systems to cover two test programs to be performed by the Structural Strength Test Group (ET30) at MSFC. One test program is governed by NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). The LaRC test program is a study on the structural response of cylindrical barrels in buckling failure modes (aka Shell Buckling Test Program), involving a total of eighteen test articles to be tested in series over the course of 6/2008 to 6/2010. The other test program is the ARES Upper Stage Test Program governed by NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center (MSFC). The first four of the seven VIC systems are required for each of the LaRC tests. The remaining three systems are required for other concurrent ARES US structural testing. VIC Systems, also known as Photogrammetry, provides highly accurate, full-field, three-dimensional shape and deformation data of complex objects. LaRC Test Requirements to MSFC ET30 call for the VIC System to be VIC-3D from Correlated Solutions, Inc. The ARES Test Program has multiple tests with VIC requirements. After completion of the LaRC Shell Buckling Test Program in 2010, these systems would be available to fulfill future ARES Test Requirements. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1. There are multiple Correlated Solutions VIC systems already in operation at two NASA centers ? one at the NASA center where the eighteen tests will take place (MSFC) and six more at the NASA center requesting the tests (LaRC). To support the LaRC test program and current ARES test plans, the VIC system chosen must be compatible with the VIC systems already in place. They must also be able to be synchronized with each other in order to have real-time analysis capabilities of large test articles requiring multiple VIC systems. Only the VIC System from Correlations Solutions, Inc. has this compatibility with the systems already in place. It is impossible to synchronize VIC Systems from different companies together in a real time fashion due to the fact that the data storage is in binary format that is proprietary to the particular company's software package. 2. Real-time data display is critical to evaluate impending buckling modes during the testing. The VIC System from Correlated Solutions offers real-time data display of up to 30,000 points per second. Based on market research including web-site literature and phone conversations, the competition is several times slower for the Government's testing application. 3. Calibration of the VIC System is critical. The system is highly dependent on setup, and the calibration is easily upset and lost. If the calibration is upset and lost on any other system, then all of the valuable test data is also lost and the test must be repeated (often this is not possible). The calibration of the VIC System from Correlated Solutions, however, ensures that, even when the calibration is upset and lost (e.g. due to the cameras being bumped), a recalibration is possible even after the test and all test data can be salvaged. 4. Test personnel from LaRC and MSFC are already trained on the VIC System from Correlated Solutions. Additional cost and schedule (LaRC test delay of &gt;2 weeks) would be realized to re-train test personnel on another system. Additional cost  would also be realized to generate and maintain the required documentation on two systems. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. CST on 04/08/2008.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". 1852.215-84  Ombudsman. (OCTOBER 2003)  (a)    An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  (b)	If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the installation ombudsman, Robin N. Henderson, George C. Marshall Space Flight Center 256-961-1919 (office), 256-544-8369 (fax), robin.n.henderson@nasa.gov.  Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may be referred to the NASA ombudsman, the Director of the Contract Management Division, at 202-358-0445, facsimile 202-358-3083, e-mail james.a.balinskas@nasa.gov.    Please do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting officer or as specified elsewhere in this document.

<RESPDATE>033108
<ARCHDATE>04302008
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Andrea Brunsman, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-9699
<DESC>NAICS Code: 813312   The US Environmental Protection Agency, Officer of Air and Radiation, Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) plans to award a Sole Source purchase order to BioDiversity Research Institute (BRI) under Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13: Simplified Acquisitions under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1). CAMD has a requirement for analytical services to standardize and assess monitored datasets of mercury concentrations in wildlife from sites across the nation.  The requirement includes compilation of mercury monitoring datasets, development of a documented,  standardized, geo-referenced database, and the mapping and assessment of thresholds, patterns and trends in the data.   Much of BRI's work in the past 10 years has included the collection of mercury (Hg) samples from many parts of the environment with an emphasis on wildlife.  Their efforts have  resulted in the accumulation of over 60,000 Hg data points.  BRI staff biologists and collaborators have directly collected Hg data in the following 25 states:  Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New  Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  While some of the data collected in these states are available in governmental reports and peer-reviewed papers, much of the data are only  available through direct access with BRI.  BRI is the sole entity that houses these data.  No other agencies, company, or organization has direct access to BRI's Hg database.  The unique quality of the BRI Hg database is that it is primarily populated with Hg concentrations found in wildlife and  represents the largest wildlife Hg database in North America.  Most Hg data that are widely available are in the form of sediment, water and fish. Therefore, BRI is uniquely qualified conduct the work required by EPA.   The Clean Air Markets Division requires this database of Hg concentrations in  wildlife to establish a future, integrated mercury monitoring network (e.g., air, water, sediments, fish, wildlife).  This Hg database is a critical resource for EPA and other federal agencies.  EPA requires an ability to document and understand spatial and temporal trends of Hg to assess the  efficacy of future mercury control regulations.  The basis for determining spatiotemporal trends will greatly depend on existing datasets that will provide a baseline context as well as evidence of data gaps.  BRI is the only entity that has Hg data collected from wildlife using standardized  protocols for 25 U.S. states.  The long-term collection and reporting of these data also places BRI scientists, such as Dr. David Evers, in a unique position to have substantial interpretive abilities of how Hg is exposed and effects wildlife at a national level. Due to the nature of this  procurement EPA believes there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these requirements. No solicitation or Request for Quotes is available. Any firm that believes it is capable of meeting these requirements may submit a response, which if received by COB Monday, March 31, 2008, will be  considered. Response must be submitted in writing to via the e-mail link below. No telephone calls will be accepted.  The point of contact for this procurement is Andrea L. Brunsman, Contracting Officer, at brunsman.andrea@epa.gov.

The science achievement levels will be set in accordance with the Governing Board's policy for setting achievement levels. The Board's policy on achievement levels was adopted in 1990 and has been amended several times thereafter. Achievement levels-setting procedures for science shall take into account the unique features of NAEP as a survey of student performance for which no individual student scores are reported; the specific features of the NAEP 2009 framework and specifications; the history of NAEP achievement levels; the Congressional requirement to show that NAEP achievement levels are useful, reasonable, and valid; and current research in standard setting. 

The basis of the contract award will be price and other factors, to include capability of the offeror to provide the requested services and perform quality work, based on experience in performing similar work. All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to the solicitation. All responses received timely, shall be considered by the Governing Board.

The basis of contract award will be the technical capability of the offeror to provide the required services combined with cost factors. All responses received by the due date will be given full consideration

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Cameca Instruments, Inc, of Trumbull, Connecticut, for the acquisition of an Upgrade of IMS-1270 Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer to IMS-1280 to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

BACKGROUND
The Analytical Microscopy Group in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory conducts research by applying various microscopies to elucidate the chemical and structural properties of matter on dimensions of micrometers to nanometers where the major analytical techniques utilize excitation beams of ions, or ultraviolet to infrared photons, and detection of analytical signals from ions, electrons, or photons; applies scanning probe microscopies and nuclear track techniques; and researches the fundamental studies of the excitation process, quantification, standards development, instrumental improvements, data and image analyses, and applications of these techniques to problems in chemistry, materials science, semiconductor technology, biotechnology, and environmental science.

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.

(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole source determination is based on the need for longer instrument lifetime, higher reliability, and computer hardware and software that are compatible with NIST standards.  Cameca Instruments is uniquely qualified to provide the required upgrade due to their knowledge of the proprietary hardware and software components of the current system.  Cameca Instruments is the only contractor who can provide the upgrade to the instrument to bring it up to the configuration and specifications of the Cameca IMS-1280 model.  Cameca Instruments is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required upgrade.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by April 3, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>TITLE:  NAS MEXICO CITY - DENSIMETERS
The U.S. Department of State, Regional Procurement Support Office and the Narcotics Affairs Office, Mexico City are seeking other qualified offerors for manufacture and supply of sixty eight (68), US-made portable molecular density measuring devices.  Specific Model K910B Model (Buster) portable detection devices for use by Mexican Customs (SHCP/SAT/AGA) to inspect vehicles for drugs, chemical substances, arms, ammunition, and undeclared national & foreign currency at the nation's Northern and Southern borders.  In addition to manufacturing and supplying these units,  the Contractor will also provide training (4 different locations in Mexico) plus a full year-one warranty on all parts and labor as well as year-two maintenance, service, and consumable re-supply for the equipment.  Per the  Justification For Other Than Full & Open Competition JOFOC),text provided below, there is only one known U.S. manufacturer of the subject product.

NAS MEXICO CITY - DENSIMETERS
TEXT OF JUSTIFICATION & APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL & OPEN COMPETITION 
1. Recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of  sixty-eight (68) portable devices for measuring molecular density (densimeters), with a power source that allows for use without external hook-ups, remote display and a detection alarm.  The system will be equipped to ensure optimum operation regardless of the climate and external conditions.  Additionally, the system will be used by Mexican Customs (SHCP/SAT/AGA) to inspect vehicles for drugs, chemical substances, arms, ammunition, laundered money, and undeclared national and foreign currency at the countrys northern and southern borders.  The estimated cost is $___and includes on-site operator training (Mexico City), a 1-year warranty for all parts/labor, plus a 1-year provision for service, maintenance and consumable re-supply.  2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.  To contract with Only Known Source for the manufacture and supply, of the specific brand name product, otherwise known as Densimeter Model K910B Buster.  Additionally, the Commercial Item Purchase Order will contain  provisions for the Contractor to provide Operator Instructional Training in Mexico (& in Spanish), maintenance & consumables for a one year period, and an all parts & labor warranty for one year. 3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency needs.  The Narcotics Affairs Section, American Embassy Mexico is initiating this procurement under its Bilateral Border Security Project that directly supports the U.S. / Mexico 22-Point Safe & Security Border Agreement signed by the Presidents of both nations in March 2002.  Commonality in training and inspection processes have been established as requirements for each nation in fulfilling their duties under the aforementioned Agreement and the K910B densimeter has been exclusively utilized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) since 1994.  Accordingly, the K910B Model densimeter is the only product that can meet the agency?s needs. 4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  The K910B dimensions (6x 3x 3), sensitivity, and accompanying density measurement table affords inspectors with a unique ease of handling and reference for ascertaining the presence of hidden contraband.  Similar products available do not satisfy the size, sensitivity, nor density measurement features offered by the Sole Known Source?s  product.  6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. Even though our research (including historical data from CBP, whose current contract with Known Source was awarded after advertising for other sources) in part, resulted in this justification that there is only one responsible source who can satisfy the agency requirements, the Contracting Officer will advertise this procurement opportunity in Fed Biz Ops to seek other competition.  7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  Sole Known Source has confirmed that it will offer Dept. of State/NAS the same pricing that it provides to its most favored customer, Customs and Border Protection under their contract.  Pricing has been confirmed by CBP as significantly lower than pricing Known Source offers commercial customers.  8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.  The only remaining market survey will be the Fed Biz Ops advertisement to determine if there are any new sources who can offer the same product K910B US-made.  9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.  The only other known source offering a similar product, is a foreign-made product that would require a source-origin waiver.  The Identified Source?s product is U.S. manufactured and will require no such waiver.  Additionally, recent reviews of the foreign-made product concluded with determinations that performance was not equal and the size requirement was not met.  The foreign product was described an imitation of the US-made K910B.  10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition. None prior to advertisement.  11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. Since Customer has indicated a desire to establish a long term procurement instrument (such as an IDIQ contract) for both this type of equipment and its support services, the Government will prepare a sources sought advertisement for any subsequent transactions.  Advertisement will be posted in Fed Biz Ops to determine if other sources have entered the market at that time as well.  CERTIFICATIONS WITHHELD JOFOC Approved on 3/7/2008 @ appropriate level within agency.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The mission of ESF-7 is to synchronize and fully integrate logistics management and resource support capabilities into an effective national supply chain management system by leveraging the strengths, capabilities, and resources of its partners. The purpose of the forum is to begin dialogue to seek ideas and ways that FEMA and GSA can work more effectively with its partners including the private sector.

FEMA and GSA senior leadership will brief vendors on the ESF-7 partnership, New FEMA Vision - National Response Framework (NRF), FEMA Logistic Management Directorate overview, lessons learned from recent events, and the vision for development and enhancement going forward. 
     This new approach to implement solutions and strategies for creating an integrated supply chain management system for strategic logistics will only be successful with meaningful collaboration with the private sector.  Companies are encouraged to attend this forum to share industry best practices, lessons learned, as well as information on their best processes that may be valuable in helping FEMA and GSA implement this strategy.
      The focus of the forum will be a dialogue to identify gaps, duplications, omissions, and challenges that adversely impact emergency response operations.  Companies interested in contracting opportunities with FEMA and GSA can access the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov  Registration:  Attendees are encouraged to RSVP no later than Tuesday, March 25th by sending an email to Natasha Rountree, Office of Acquisition Management, at natasha.rountree@dhs.gov with the following information:

<DESC>The following are vendor questions and the Government's responses: 1.	QUESTION: We would like to participate in VA-246-08-RP-0011 and want to know if a Personal Care License is required to participate. ANSWER:    Please state in your proposal if you have a licensed in the state of North CarolinaA determination will be made during technical evaluation.  Please submit your proposal.  If they are licensed by the State of NC, then okay. They should state that they do not have license for personal care services. We use many of the terms interchangeable, so it may not be a barrier. I will have to check to be sure. 2.	QUESTION:  For the $3.16 Fringe Benefits, can they be provided by us through benefits (health, dental, vacation time, etc.) that are equal to or exceed $3.16? ANSWER:   Yes, the Contractor has option of providing the monetary benefit of $3.16 per hour OR a cash equivalent such as benefits (health, dental, etc.).   3.	QUESTION:  We are self insured this year for the first time.  We have no experience data and will not be able to provide premium cost for that reason.  How can we prove the worth/value of the benefits we are providing? ANSWER:  All self-insured plans must be submitted to the Department to the DOL for approval in order to receive credit.  Self-insured plans must meet all requirements found in 29 CFR 4.171(a) in order to receive credit.   4.	Does anything need to be signed on page 2 of the solicitation?  I wasn't sure if that page was just supposed to be left blank. ANSWER:  No.

The Contractor shall provide all support activities necessary to ensure safe and effective accomplishment  of project criteria within specified completion times as indicated in the individual Task Orders.<BR><BR>While it is not the intent of this contract t o definitively locate and measure each and every sanitary improvement within the performance area, the M DEQ does require that existing facilities be identified and quantified.     To the extent practical, the Contractor shall determine the location and type o f existing sanitation improvements on each cabin site (i.e. type of sanitary sewer line leaving the cabin, size, type and location of septic tank or leach field , etc.) without the use of invasive investigative measures (i.e. open cut excavation).     If it is not possible to determine the exact location and dimensions of the system, the Contractor shall  provide an explanation satisfactory to MDEQ why the information     is not provided.     When possible, the Contractor shall also make a determination of the adequacy of the system, to the best of his professional abilities and judgment.

The survey will be conducted in coordination with the BLM Dependent Resurvey conducted by BLM Cadastral Survey previously/concurrently executed to the extent necessary to permit the accurate geographic placement and platting o f lots of public land (as surveyed by the contractor) to prepare official Supplemental Plats necessary for the issuance of US     Patents.<BR><BR>AREAS OF INTEREST   There are 4 main geographic sites associated with this scope of work: Fort Peck Cabin Site s, Rock Creek Cabin Sites, Hell Creek Cabin Sites, and the Pines Cabin Sites.<BR><BR>SITE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATIONS - The Fort Peck Dam and Fort Peck Lake (i.e., the Fort Peck Project) is the oldest and furthest upstream project of the six Missouri River m ain stem projects operated by the Corps. Located in northeastern Montana, the dam is approximately 1,770 miles upstream from the Missouri River confluence with the Mississippi River and approximately 11 miles upstream from the confluence with the Milk Rive r. The Fort Peck Lake is the nation s fourth largest manmade reservoir and backs up from the dam approximately 135 river miles to     the west and south. Surrounding the water surface, the Fort Peck Project also encompasses over 400,000 acres in McCone, Va lley, Garfield, Phillips, Petroleum, and Fergus Counties. Nearly the entire Fort Peck Project is within the Charles M. Russell Nation al Wildlife Refuge (CMR), which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service).     Four recreation areas on the Fort Peck Lake (Fort Peck, the Pines, Hell Creek, and Rock Creek) have cottage areas (cabin sites) within them. These cabin sites are within areas designated  by the Corps for intensive use recreation and there are individual cabin site lots leased by the Corps.     Title VIII of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 authorized Secretary of the Army, working with Secretary of the Interior, to identify cab in sites suitable for conveyance (i.e., sale) to current lessees and to perform the necessary environmental and real estate activities to dispose of these cabin sites at fair market value. The funds received from the conveyance of the cabin sites will be d eposited in the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Trust for use in acquiring other lands with greater wildlife and other public value f or the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge Cabin Sites - Within the intensive use recreation areas (Fort Pe ck, the Pines, Hell Creek, and Rock Creek), four cottage areas have been designated (Figure 1). Collectively, the cottage areas include individual lots leased by the Corps to private individuals in accordance with 16 U.S.C. 460d. The lessees have construct ed cabins or cottages on these lots that are on federal lands managed by the Corps and within the exterior boundaries of the CMR National Wildlife Refuge. All leased cabin sites have power available and have permanent structures (improvements) on them. All  sites were inventoried in the fall of 2002 to evaluate each lot s improvements, septic systems (if known), and water supply system.<BR><BR>SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this particular project are listed below in descending order of impor tance.     <BR>       a.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NUMBER 003 TO SOLICITATION# WWPP-08-2009-TX.  In light of new developments, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) has determined it necessary to cancel the current Solicitation and re-solicit it at a future date.  In short, the BEP has begun a process of re-evaluating how it will manage its wastewater pretreatment plants both in Washington D.C. and in Ft. Worth, TX which will likely lead to a variety of new contractual requirements. Upon completion of the evaluation, the BEP will re-solicit the requirement for Texas with a revised solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is for Naval Air Warfare Center ? Aircraft Division to announce a request for SOURCES SOUGHT for the P-3 Digital Magnetic Anomaly Detection (DMAD) System requirement (NAICS code 334511) as well as to announce an INDUSTRY DAY to be held on 11 July 2007.  THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  It is the Government?s intent to conduct a full and open competition to procure a Commercial Off the Shelf/Non-Developmental Item (COTS/NDI) DMAD system for integration into the P-3C mission aircraft.  The anticipated contract will include non-recurring engineering to address integration, as well as Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract Line Item structure to the offeror that represents the best overall value to the Government. THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SOLICITED OR PROVIDED.   

The United States Navy has an emergent requirement for a replacement Magnetic Anomaly Detection System (MAD) to replace legacy MAD systems on U.S. Navy P-3 aircraft. The P-3 DMAD program will provide COTS/NDI equipment as an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) upgrade to the P-3 weapon system.  Aircraft that will receive the DMAD improvements include P-3C AIP, P-3 BMUP and P-3 BMUP Plus aircraft.  The P-3 DMAD system shall be compatible with existing P-3 airframe, propulsion, and avionics related systems.  Additionally, the P-3 DMAD system shall not degrade the performance, functionality and maintainability of the P-3 aircraft, and most importantly, shall not require any dedicated aircraft maneuvers to compensate for the system.  The DMAD program is applicable on up to 97  P-3C mission aircraft.

Information that may be critical for industry to refine its concepts for the DMAD system include a draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) and a draft Performance Specification (PSPEC) which are included at the following website address: http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm .

SOURCES SOUGHT:  It is requested that interested businesses submit to the contracting office a brief capability statement package, company profile, and associated pre-printed product information sheets demonstrating ability to perform the effort listed in the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  The entire capability statement package submitted shall be no more than a total 10 pages in length, single spaced, 12 pt font minimum (excluding pre-printed product information sheets).  

The capability statement package may be sent by mail to Department of the Navy, Commander Naval Air Warfare Center ? Aircraft Division, ATTN: Lorraine Rardin (Code 2.5.1.4.3.5), 21983 Bundy Road, BLDG 441, Unit 7, Patuxent River, MD 20670, by facsimile to (301) 757-9046, or by email to lorraine.rardin@navy.mil.  Submissions must be received no later than 1400 Eastern Daylight Savings Time on 03 July 2007.  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed to Lorraine Rardin via email at lorraine.rardin@navy.mil 

All responses must include the following contact information: Company Name; Company Address; Company Business Size; and POC Name, Phone Number, Fax Number, and email address.

INDUSTRY DAY: Naval Air Warfare Center ? Aircraft Division will host an Industry Day forum on Wednesday, 11 July 2007 starting at 0900 Eastern Daylight Savings Time  to provide interested parties with additional information and solicit feedback on the upcoming P-3 DMAD System requirement.  This forum will be held at Eagle Systems, 22560 Epic Drive, California, Maryland.   There will be a one hour general brief on the P-3 and the DMAD program, along with an open question and answer period.  There will be additional one-on-one opportunities for industry to ask questions and provide comments on requirements.  

All interested attendees must pre-register by email to Lorraine Rardin at lorraine.rardin@navy.mil or facsimile to (301) 757-9046.   Telephone registration requests will not be accepted.   Parties interested in one-on-one discussion periods should indicate their desire when registering.  One-on-one periods will be limited to 45 minute discussions.  Registering parties must include the attending individual?s name, company, phone, and email address.  Picture identification is required to enter the building.  As seating is limited, only two (2) individuals per company and only individuals that pre-register are guaranteed seating.  Questions received by 1400 Eastern Daylight Savings Time on 3 July 2007 are projected to be addressed at the Industry Day forum.   For those individuals unable to attend the forum, the presented material will be available on 18 July 2007 at the following NAVAIR website address; http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/index.cfm .  
Any questions concerning this material should be submitted to Lorraine Rardin at lorraine.rardin@navy.mil   

Industry comments and feedback to the draft requirements documents will be analyzed, considered, and possibly used in the development of a potential Solicitation and/or Request for Proposal (RFP).  All industry comments and feedback should be delivered via email to Lorraine Rardin, lorraine.rardin@navy.mil no later than 1700 Eastern Daylight Savings Time 16 July 2007.  

Due to organizational conflict of interest issues, it is noted that RBC, Inc. and Eagle Systems, Inc. provide Contractor Support Services (CSS) to PMA-207.  RBC and Eagle Systems employees will help form the requirements.  Therefore, RBC and Eagle Systems will not be allowed to bid on the DMAD effort at either the prime or sub level.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.
The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this SSN is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates pursuing the acquisition of information technology services for the analysis and potentially the implementation of a system for the preparation and submission of complex (multi-project) electronic grant applications. Titles of subsets include those submitted for grants under the P01 Research Program Project Grant, P30 Center Core Grants, and U54 Interdisciplinary Research Consortium. These types of grant applications include multiple projects within a single application submission.  Each subproject includes information at the level of detail of a full grant application, including individual budgets that may roll up to multiple levels of summary budget, as well as a single overall budget.
Characteristics of the proposed grant application system:
?	Provides ease of use for both applicants and agency staff posting funding opportunities
?	Stores ?work in progress? applications.  Also provides for the applicant to download and store copies of both in-progress and completed applications, to allow for reuse of previously entered application data.

?	Provides a clear distinction between the software that manages the application data and process, and the software that presents and collects the data from the applicant. 
?	Provides for the evolution of user interface technologies with minimal change to the data management and storage functionality.
?	Supports the dynamic definition and application of data business rules without the need for new software development and may support the extraction of such business rules from Grants.gov, NIH or other agency business rule repositories via Web Services.
?	Support business rules associated with budgets that provide for summation of budgets across multiple dimensions and the ability to constrain each budget dimension independently based on dynamically defined budget allocation.
?	Supports multiple tiers of budget within sub-applications
?	Supports multiple tiers of budgets summarizing the sub-application budgets
?	Supports extraction and population of key data in the application from NIH, other agency or grantee institution records accessed via Web Services.
?	Supports authentication of system users against NIH, other agency or grantee institution account information accessed via Web Services as well as supporting users who may not be registered with external authorities.
?	Meets the requirements of 29 U.S.C. 749d, Section 508.
?	Stores protected personal, proprietary and other sensitive information securely in accordance with federal law and regulation including but not limited to 44 U.S.C. 3451 (FISMA), 5 U.S.C. 552a (The Privacy Act) and 44 U.S.C. 201 (HIPAA) where these are relevant.

Background

Social Security touches the lives of all Americans, young and old alike. This year over 17 million people will receive a new or reissued Social Security Card, many of them infants. Approximately 163 million workers will work in jobs covered by Social Security' provisions for Retirement, Survivors & Disability benefits, and more than 54 million individuals will receive monthly benefit payments.

To support this mammoth program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) operates one of the largest enterprise database environments, containing more than 70 Terabytes of information for the citizenry of the United States including all those who have received a Social Security Number, are working, have applied for, or are receiving, Social Security benefits or Supplementary Security Income payments.  This data is the foundation for SSA's processing systems. Effective and efficient management of this data is vital to SSA's mission to provide accurate benefits and efficient service to the American public, today and in the future.  

The Social Security Act of 1935, signed into law on August 14, 1935, established the Social Security program and operations began in the fall of 1936, with the issuance of a Social Security Number (SSN) to each worker covered by the provisions of that Act. Today, more than 70 years later, the data created by that process (i.e. the identity of those individuals and their respective SSN's) is still a vital and necessary part of SSA's active enterprise data holdings, as is the record of their lifetime earnings, collected and recorded in the ensuing years.  

Thus, unlike most other modern information technology environments, SSA's databases contain, by necessity, data spanning the entire 72-year period of the Social Security program's existence. Data collected in 1936 is still relevant today, not just for historical purposes, but for contemporary and future processing. 

Since the beginning, Social Security has strived to employ the best available technology to provide the best service to the American public in the most efficient manner.  In the 1930's and 1940's, that technology was Electronic Accounting Machines with data stored on punched cards. (Purportedly, SSA was the largest user of punch cards during those years.)  In the mid 1950's, Social Security became one of the first organizations to enter the computer age, transferring data stored in punch cards to magnetic tape and developing batch computer systems to run on mainframe computers with 20K of memory.  

Throughout the 1950's and 60's, as SSA acquired succeeding generations of technology, larger and more sophisticated automated processes were implemented, which, in turn, generated more and more data. In the early 1970's, SSA began building online databases, providing query access through rudimentary networks to our community based offices. 

In 1982, the agency launched a five-year, $600 million Systems Modernization Plan to accelerate the adoption and integration of new technologies. The result was a modern systems architecture and infrastructure to support online processing and a database environment supported by the IDMS DBMS and MADAM, an SSA developed database system. Through the remainder of the 1980's and the 1990's, this technical foundation enabled a major transformation of the SSA's systems environment. In 1995, Social Security also began construction of the first large-scale repository for unstructured data (image) files to support paperless processing. 

In the past ten years, database growth has accelerated, data access has been extended to Internet and support for unstructured data has greatly expanded. SSA now operates one of the largest document management systems in the world, and unlike most other major enterprises, data captured or created during each of these eras is still critical to today's business processes.

Description

SSA's current production database environment includes support for DB2 v8 for z/OS and Oracle 10g, Microsoft SQL Server, as well as CA/IDMS and SSA's Master Data Access Method (MADAM) - a legacy, in-house developed database management tool implemented during the 1980's.   Initiatives are underway to ensure an orderly multiyear transition from MADAM and CA/IDMS to IBM's DB/2.  SSA also manages very large document repositories supported by IBM's Content Manager and by Global 360.  
The hub of SSA's enterprise database environment is in the National Computer Center (NCC) located at the agency's headquarters complex near Baltimore, MD, with portions of the data housed at multiple sites around the country. These databases are hosted by a hardware environment consisting primarily of IBM mainframe computers running the IBM z/OS operating system and Sun Microsystems computers running the Solaris operating system.  In addition to the very large enterprise production environment, SSA's also operates a comprehensive multi-tiered enterprise development environment consisting of five separate phases, each supported by its own environment - configured with hardware, software, data and procedures designed to facilitate the efficient and orderly transition of our enterprise application systems through all life-cycle phases from development through implementation. 

Over the next decade, the Social Security Administration's workload will increase substantially. Retirement claims will jump by more than 40 percent and disability claims by nearly 10 percent. The first wave of 80 million baby boomers has applied for Social Security, and boomers are likely to seek disability benefits in greater numbers than did previous generations. 

SSA's data environment must be prepared to accommodate this tremendous increase in workload while maintaining the integrity, availability and accessibility of our enterprise databases and continuing the process of identifying and adopting relevant new technologies to better serve the American public. 

Therefore, Social Security Administration is seeking to identify organizations having experience and expertise in assisting large organizations plan and implement strategies to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of their enterprise databases in the following areas:
 
1.	Evaluating the technical infrastructure of very large enterprise database environments 

2.	Effectively leveraging existing architectures and infrastructures to meet emerging requirements

3.	Efficiently migrating from legacy database systems 

4.	Developing and/or implementing software interface layers to facilitate isolation, integration and standardization

5.	Implementing processes to Improve and maintain data quality 

6.	Designing and Implementing database infrastructures to achieve high availability

7.	Designing database partitioning strategies to maximize back-up/recovery efficiencies including disaster recovery.

8.	Identifying and addressing existing and anticipated data related challenges

9.	Establishing technology refreshment processes to effectively identify, adopt and deploy appropriate new data related technologies

10.	Implementing workable data administration processes that produce a quantifiable positive return on investment.

11.	Developing and implementing systems and methods to maintain appropriate Control, Audit, Security and Privacy (CASP) requirements while expanding access to, and use of critical data to non-systems components. 

Vendor Responses

Vendors who have assisted large geographically dispersed organizations to develop an Enterprise Data Strategy for the architecture, deployment, and operation of very large database environment supporting a large number of end users are invited to submit information concerning their past experience in performing those services.  Detailed responses should be provided addressing each of the above listed nine topic areas.  The responses should include, where possible, redacted copies of strategy documents and other deliverables which were produced during your engagements.  Where Client agreements preclude providing even redacted copies of the requested information, vendors may substitute topic outlines or tables of content for the restricted deliverables. Vendors should include also client contact information for their cited engagements.  

Vendor responses should provide detailed accounts of:

1.	The company/organization to which the vendor provided the services.

2.	A reference contact at the company (name, title, email, phone number).

3.	What the customer provided.

4.	What services the vendor provided.

5.	Description and make up of the team that provided the services.

6.	The duration of the engagement.

7.	If possible, a rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost of the engagement.

NOTE: The services described herein involve high-level Agency strategic planning and very significant capital investments; therefore, it is vital to the SSA that these services be provided completely free of any and all real or apparent biases, and with great discretion. Due to the nature of the work described any contractor selected at a later time to perfom these tasks contractor may be deemed ineligible to participate in any directly related commercial enterprises. Any party selected to perform these services on behalf of the Social Security Administration would be subject to a pre-contract vetting process and would be required to sign the SSA's confidentiality and conflict of interest certifications.

<SUBJECT>D -- Notice to Intent to Extend Contract
<DESC>The Department of State, Office of Acquisition, intends to use Other Than Full and Open Competition under the authority 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements to extend Accenture National Security Services (ANSS) contract,  for integration services for the Integrated Logistics Management System. 
The current contract is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2008.  The additional effort requires amendment to the agreement with a modification to the Statement of Work and Budget sections of the existing agreement and an extension of the period of performance for a 10 month period of 1 April 2008 through 31 January 2009.   The extension will allow the Department to commence a full and open competition resulting in a performance based contract awarded later this year. 
Description of work to be performed: High end of year procurement transaction volume and associated spikes in customer support requirements represent a significant annual milestone for A/LM, the ILMS program office, and the performing contractor. For this effort, the software baseline must be frozen with all patches and upgrades tested and implemented well in advance of end of year, prior to the build up of transaction volume.  Operational testing, performance tuning and contingency planning activities are executed prior to year end in order to limit the risk of system interruptions during this critical time of year.  These activities, coupled with the aggressive stabilization effort for the Departments new contracting system would make changing contractors in the months leading up to fiscal year-end, an invitation for calamity, and is not in the best interest of the Department, A/LM, ILMS customers, and the strategic partners of ILMS.  Once a new contractor is chosen, an adequate transition period must be allocated for training and familiarization with A/LM business processes.  Considering the current time of year, adequate time does not exist to complete the full and open recompetition of this highly complex program.  In addition to year end activity support, an extension is also needed to commence the financial integration with RFMS.  
The impact of not executing a contract extension would be immediate and severe.   All domestic procurement is executed and supported through the ILMS program.  Continued, uninterrupted operations of ILMS is required to maintain continuity of operations within A/LM, the logistics branch of the Department.

<LOCATION>Sandia National Laboratories
<ZIP>87185
<CLASSCOD>A
<NAICS>541511
<OFFADD>Department of Energy, Sandia Corp. (DOE Contractor), Sandia National Laboratories, PO Box 5800 MS: 0115, Albuquerque, NM, 87185, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>A -- Seeking Participation in Meshing and Geometry Innovation Collaboration (MAGIC)
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking U.S. commercial and U. S. research participants willing to participate in the formation of a new Meshing And Geometry Innovation Collaboration. This partnership will be executed as a series of Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADA).

The technical goal of this consortium is to produce the next generation software tools to facilitate model generation (i.e. meshes) for computational analyses. The model generation technology includes means to create, import, defeature and cleanup geometric CAD models from a heterogeneous CAD environment expected to persist within the DOE and DoD. It also includes the meshing, or discretization of this geometry into acceptable elements for wildly varying analyses. Both surface (quads / tris / quad-dominant) and volume (hex, tet, hybrid, boundary layer, chimera, etc.) meshing algorithms are necessary. 

The pressing technical challenges for this effort include providing analysis-centric conceptual design geometry, providing leading edge meshing tools and significantly strengthening tools to edit, cleanup and defeature legacy geometry from varied sources. The tool set will be architected to provide streamlined end-user customization, strong modular componentization and ultimately interoperability within any custom work process.

Two government agencies are forming a partnership to initiate this collaboration, by pooling resources and consolidating management of this project. The CUBIT team, from Sandia National Laboratories, who has a strong existing product and a strong technical reputation in this area will partner with the newly forming geometry and meshing team for the CREATE program, from the DoD's High Performance Computing Modernization Office (HPCMO). This partnership will include a consortium open to any U.S. commercial participants and U.S. research institutes willing to meet the criteria outlined below.

1) Commercial Vendors. Any U. S. commercial vendor who has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The vendor must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. This should include access to source as well as compiled libraries as appropriate. Their products must be substantive (represent at least a 30 person-year effort), and deemed technically significant by the government partners. The vendor must also be willing to allow government use (all U.S. federal government agencies and all U.S. federal government contractors in support of U.S. federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge, except to cover existing software licensing costs (e.g. royalties for an existing 3rd party solid modeling engine). Such existing costs are expected to be very low. In return, the commercial vendor will be able to execute a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. Vendor supplied code will be designated "vendor-protected" preventing acquisition by other vendors or commercial integrators, unless such companies agree between themselves.

2) Commercial Integrators. Any U. S. commercial entity interested in direct integration of the produced code into their company products and processes is invited to participate. The commercial entity must be willing to invest, via the CRADA mechanism, at least $1M per year at Sandia to support the integrated development. In turn, they will be allowed to use the product internally free of charge, except to cover existing 3rd party licensing costs (e.g. royalties for a solid modeling package). Such costs are expected to be very low. As a paying CRADA member, they will leverage existing and future government code, and also be able to direct the use of their money toward specific capabilities needed. The commercial entity and Sandia may agree to designate specific portions thus developed to be CRADA-protected for the commercial entity's internal use as provided for by the CRADA mechanism. They will also be able to negotiate a non-exclusive commercialization agreement to market the non-protected consortium developed code to non-government users. 

3) University and Research Participants. Any U. S. university or U.S. research institution that has a significant technical product focused on meshing and/or geometry related to meshing is invited to participate. The university/institution must be willing to provide their product(s) in an easily integrated form into the developed whole. Their product(s) must be substantive and viewed as technically significant by the government partners. The university/institution must be willing to allow government use (all US federal government agencies and all US federal government contractors in support of US federal government contracts) of the integrated executable free of charge. Universities/institutions are encouraged to allow vendor and commercial integrators use of the technology, but not required. In return, they will be able to leverage the extensive existing and future developments of the consortium for use within their research organizations, and to further their research agendas. It is anticipated that participation may be encouraged by the various government funding agencies sponsoring research development.

As in the past, government developed technology will continue to be available for technology transfer via an appropriate licensing agreement. Such agreements will be handled by Sandia. However, CRADA protected and vendor supplied software would not be available through licenses with Sandia.

Sandia will use objective evaluation criteria to determine which potential partners provide the greatest likelihood of success.  Sandia anticipates having to establish one or more Agreements with potential partners which may include Commercial License Agreements, Cooperative Research And Development Agreements (CRADAs), or Work For Other (WFO) Agreements.  The use of a CRADA is preferable. In the case of CRADAs, where several potential partners are identified and selected, Sandia National Laboratories may require the selected partners to enter into a Mulitpartner CRADA with Sandia.  Selected partners should be prepared and able to accept standard CRADA Terms and Conditions "AS-IS".

To express your interest in this technology transfer opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Steve Owen by April 8, 2008 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0376, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87185-0376. Fax (505) 284-0140.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice and describe the manner in which your company will enhance the likelihood of programmatic success.  This is not a federal government procurement and therefore there will be no debriefing regarding the results of Sandia?s selection process. 

Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<DESC>NOTICE CONCERNING:

National Logistics Coordination Forum

On March 27, 2008, Emergency Support Function-7 (ESF-7) Co-Agency leaders, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Logistics Management Directorate and the General Services Administration (GSA) will host an information forum that will include participants from federal, state and local governments and the private sector.  The mission of ESF-7 is to synchronize and fully integrate logistics management and resource support capabilities into an effective national supply chain management system by leveraging the strengths, capabilities, and resources of its partners.  The purpose of the forum is to begin dialogue to seek ideas and ways that FEMA and GSA can work more effectively with its partners including the private sector.  Since the primary goal following any significant disaster is to restore the viability of the impacted area as quickly as possible, FEMA and GSA would like to better engage the private sector as a part of the solution for planning for and recovering from disasters.  FEMA and GSA senior leadership will brief vendors on the ESF-7 partnership, New FEMA Vision - National Response Framework (NRF), FEMA Logistic Management Directorate overview, lessons learned from recent events, and the vision for development and enhancement going forward.  

This new approach to implement solutions and strategies for creating an integrated supply chain management system for strategic logistics will only be successful with meaningful collaboration with the private sector.  Companies are encouraged to attend this forum to share industry best practices, lessons learned, as well as information on their best processes that may be valuable in helping FEMA and GSA implement this strategy.  

The focus of the forum will be a dialogue to identify gaps, duplications, omissions, and challenges that adversely impact emergency response operations.  Companies interested contracting opportunities with FEMA and GSA can access the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov.   

National Logistics Forum will be held:

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI):  Contact-Lens Scale See-Through Displays
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) is requesting information on technology areas for the creation of micro- and nano-scale display technologies for the purpose of creating displays that could be worn as transparent contact lenses. 

A limiting factor to un-tethered augmented and/or mixed reality applications is the bulkiness, power consumption, cost, limited resolution, and limited field of view of head-mounted displays.  DARPA seeks to leap beyond incremental, evolutionary enhancement of head-mounted display technologies to a see-through contact lens on which images can be displayed.  This information might be command-and-control information, not unlike information provided to players of first-person, shooter-type video games or synthetic entities and effects in a live training environment. 

As a first step in solving this problem, DARPA/IPTO is soliciting brief white papers describing technologies in this area.  Specifically, these white papers should address the following questions.
1.	What are the basic technologies needed to develop a see-through display of this size and form factor, in a way that would be safe for humans to wear for extended periods of time (comparable to normal contact lenses)?  These should include:
-display technologies used, such as LED's, lasers, OLED's, etc.,
-antennas and radios with which to send the signal to the device to display, and
-other electronic circuitry.
2.	How such a small display could be practically manufactured on flexible substrates? 
3.	How images could be sent safely and wirelessly to the contact lens display?
4.	How power could be sent safely and wirelessly to the contact lens display?
5.	What display resolutions and fields of view could be achieved in three to five years, and how will the near-field images could be created that would be comparable to the resolution, frame rate, and color palette of head mounted displays?

Interested parties should submit brief white papers per the instructions below no later than 1200 Noon ET, 02 April 2008.  

INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources.  DARPA will employ an electronic upload submission system for responses to this RFI.  To respond to this RFI, interested parties must complete an online RFI Cover Sheet for each response, which will include the submitter's name, organization and contact information, as well as the title of their paper.   Cover Sheet submissions are made by accessing the URL below:
www.csc-ballston.com/rfi/rfiindex.asp?RFIid=08-23
After finalizing the Cover Sheet, a Confirmation screen will appear, along with instructions for uploading your position paper.  Submissions must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF and encrypted using Winzip or PKZip with 256-bit AES encryption.  An encryption password must be emailed to RFI08-23@darpa.mil at the time of submission.  See https://www.CSC-Ballston.com/baa/Encryption_Instructions.htm for additional encryption information.  Note:  the word, "PASSWORD", must appear in the subject line of the above email and there are minimum security requirements for establishing the encryption password.  Failure to provide the encryption password will result in the submission not being read.  Since respondents may encounter heavy traffic on the web server, they SHOULD NOT wait until the day the submissions are due to fill out a coversheet and upload their position paper.

White papers are limited to five (5) pages in length (not including the cover page).   Format specifications include 12-point font, single spaced, single-sided, 8.5" by 11" paper, with 1-inch margins. Each response should address the five questions posed above (on page 1) and should be as succinct as possible while at the same time providing actionable insight.  Graphics and citations are highly encouraged. 

Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the position paper not being reviewed. 

DISCLAIMERS AND IMPORTANT NOTES

**  BRAND NAME LETTER

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB-2 
			    ATTN:  Contracting Officer (Sandra. K. Turner)

FROM:  HQ AU/SCXR

SUBJECT:   Brand Name Justification, Purchase Request # F2XHA77353A002


1. Description of the supplies and services being acquired: AU/SCV desires to purchase one Aruba Wireless Controller, which will be connected to the Maxwell AFB Network. 

2. Justification for Brand Name:  MSD/IT has maintenance responsibility for the MAFB Wireless Network.  The MAFB Wireless Network consists of all Aruba equipment, and was installed by the AF Combat Information Transport System (CITI) Program Office.  Aruba is the only wireless equipment allowed by the Air Force.  Other manufacturer?s wireless equipment will not work with Aruba equipment.  Any attempt to mix in a different manufacturer?s tray will lead to the Air Force remotely disabling this equipment severly impacting both the Wing and Air University missions.  

3. Justification that Brand Name product is the only serviceable product: The items under this justification are peculiar to one maufacturer, ?Aruba Networks, Inc.? and are needed to interface with Aruba products currently in service. 

4. Actions taken to preclude future Brand Name acquisitions: MSD/IT will continue to survey the IT market and assess base-line equipment requirements to allow for integration of competing manufacturer?s products.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR BRAND NAME
PURCHASE REQUEST NUMBER:  F2XHA78030AC01

1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.  Department of the Air Force, 42nd Contracting Squadron, Maxwell AFB AL  36112.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action.  This J&A is being issued to allow for the use of ?a brand name" description to solicit for the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order, under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The purchase order is for the procurement of Hewlett-Packard (HP) computer equipment.  

3.	Description of Services Required.  Install hardware and configure Hewlett-Packard computer equipment server virtualization requirement for Air University educational support systems.  Selected vendor will install equipment manufactured by Hewlett-Packard and then will ensure the compatibility with existing Hewlett-Packard equipment and AU systems.  Air University would like to have the equipment delivered within thirty (30) days after receipt of purchase order.  The total estimated value of this effort is $XXXXX

4.	Statutory Authority.  This requirement is issued pursuant to 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited.  The items under this justification are peculiar to one manufacturer, ?Hewlett-Packard.?  Hewlett-Packard equipment has already been installed as the standard solution on Maxwell.  Hewlett-Packard equipment has already been widely installed on Maxwell AFB.  The new equipment must be the same as previously installed equipment to take advantage of the training and procedures that have already been put in place to support Hewlett-Packard equipment.  The personnel administrating the equipment have specialized training on Hewlett-Packard equipment and specialized equipment to allow central administration of Hewlett-Packard equipment.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Solicit.  This requirement will be solicited on FedBizOps, as unrestricted.  Also, this brand name justification will be posted to FedBizOps (https://www1.fbo.gov/servlet/slog) to satisfy the ?brand name? posting requirement.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.  The Contracting Officer will ensure the order represents fair and reasonable price to the Government, based on competition anticipated to be received from at least two or more vendors.

8.	Market Survey.  In accordance with FAR 10.001, market research was conducted by both AU/SCXP and 42CONS to determine if there were small businesses with GSA schedules that could fulfill part of this requirement.  All items were not available from the GSA schedule, market research has determined that using unrestricted open market procedures is the best method to use for this requirement.

9.	Other Factors Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition.  N/A

10.	List of interested sources, if any that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  Commercial Data Systems, Crystal Clear Technologies, Inc. and Four Points Technology have indicated that they could satisfy the requirement.
    	
11.   A statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.  No other Manufacturers? products can satisfy this requirement.  The equipment manufactured by Hewlett-Packard is the only type of equipment that is interoperable with the current equipment installed at Maxwell AFB.  There is no equal or substitute equipment known in the market right now that gives the same unique interoperability as Hewlett-Packard.

12.   Contracting Officer?s Certification.  The contents of this justification and approval are certified as accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

13.  Technical/Requirements Certification.  The supporting data that forms the basis of this justification has been certified and accurate by the appropriate management level of the technical/requirements organization.  However, since the manufacturer of these products, Hewlett-Packard, is a large business and no waiver exists, this requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-08-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.  This is a total small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-913), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 372-3692, Fax: (202) 475-3904.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24.


I.	GENERAL

BACKGROUND

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an independent Federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to administer the National Labor Relations Act, the primary law governing relations between unions and employers in the private sector.  The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity.  The NLRB has two principal functions:  
(1) 	to determine, through secret ballot elections, the free democratic choice by employees whether they wish to be represented by a union in dealing with their employers and, if so, by which union; and 
(2) 	to prevent and remedy unlawful acts, called unfair labor practices, by either employers or unions.  
The Agency processes only those charges of unfair labor practices and petitions for employee elections that are filed with the NLRB in one of its 51 Regional, Sub-regional, or Resident Offices.
The NLRB Division of Operations-Management (OM) will host two separate groups, of its Field Office Support Staff, to come to Washington, DC, to participate in the Washington Support Staff Exchange Program.  

PLACE AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE / HOURS OF OPERATION

The hotel will be located within four (4) blocks of the NLRB Headquarters, 1099 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20005.  

II.	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
The NLRB seeks eleven (11) nights of lodging accommodations for two (2) groups of five (5) individuals, at a rate, not to exceed the per diem rate, for Washington, DC. 

 
Group 1:	 requires 11 nights for 5 individuals who will check in on Monday, July 14 and check out on Friday, July 25, 2008.  

Group 2:	 requires 11 nights for 5 individuals who will check in on Monday, August 4 and check out on Friday, August 15, 2008.   

The hotel must     1) be compliant with the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. 2201 et seq, (Public Law 101-391) and hold a FEMA certification number;  and   2) be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 12101 et seq. (ADA)

No taxes shall be charged on any rooms provided by the hotel under this contract, as the U.S. Government is exempted from such taxes.  All room rates are inclusive of all service charges.  Rooms at the GSA Government per diem rate at $154/night or lower.  

No guest will reserve room individually.  The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will provide the Contractor with a personnel roster not later than seven days prior to Group check in date.

All rooms will include high standard of hygiene, private bath with full toilet and shower facilities, hot and cold running water, air conditioning/heaters, clean towels/linens on a daily basis, electricity, color cable television, telephones and appropriate furniture.  All regular hotel guest facilities and amenities will be made available for room occupants free of charge for as long as they are registered in the hotel.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to change requirements.  

The Government shall not be held liable for will not pay for telephone charges, mini-bars, laundry, room service, and any other hotel charges, other than those specifically provided for in this contract.  Consuming hotel guests will be responsible for, and pay for all such charges found on their room statements.  Lodging, service charges, etc., must be itemized separately on room bills.  The COR will identify individuals for whom the Government will pay for lodging under this contract.  All other rooms and services are the responsibility of the individual.

B.	APPLICABLE PROVISIONS:  

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items; 

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items;

FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items;

C.	CONTRACT AWARD:


The NLRB prefers to award a single contract for the lodging for both groups, but will consider multiple awards to accommodate each group.  The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price type contract.  The NLRB may evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. Discussions may be conducted if the NLRB determines they are necessary. The NLRB may reject any or all offers if such action is in the best interest of the NLRB; accept other than the lowest offer, and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 


D.	PROPOSAL SUBMISSION

Proposals shall be submitted to the NLRB, no later than 10AM, Wednesday, March 23, 2008.  Proposal submissions may be emailed to talisa.spottswood@nlrb.gov, with a carbon copy to andrew.steed@nlrb.gov.


D.1	The Offeror shall submit a Technical Proposal illustrating their approach for satisfying the requirements of this combined synopsis/solicitation.  Proposals must be clear, coherent, and prepared in sufficient detail for effective evaluation of the Offeror?s proposal against the evaluation criteria.  The following information will be included in the technical proposal:  


(a) Capability to provide accommodations as stated in the SOW, 

(b) show how minimum qualifications are met or exceeded, including location of the hotel in relation to the NLRB Headquarters, 

(c) provide detail description on what is included in lodging accommodations, 

(d) provide brochures and/or documentation of what you are proposing, and

The NLRB will award a contract resulting from this combined synopsis/solicitation to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the combined synopsis/solicitation, is deemed to offer the NLRB the best value, price and other factors considered. 


E.	EVALUATION CRITERIA

The proposals will be evaluated using the following evaluation criteria: the Offeror?s understanding of the requirements, the superiority of the offered accommodations and price.  Price will be significant with respect to closely ranked proposals.  Price differences will be compared with the value of the differences to determine which proposal offers the best value to the NLRB.   The NLRB will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost in order to achieve slightly superior features.  Proposals not deemed capable of providing the service specified will not be considered for award regardless of price.


Notice of Award. The NLRB may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are discussions after its receipt, before an offer's specified expiration time, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, will result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Restroom facilities adjacent to the visitor center at the 9,700 foot elevation of Haleakala National Park are presently serviced by water stored in underground storage tanks.

Additionally, depending on supply, Haleakala's main water storage and distribution system located at the 7,000 ft. elevation may at times be made available for contractor's use to fill their tanker and haul the water to the 9,700 ft. elevation.  Contractor will adjust rate to compensate for the shorter trip.  Determination to use the main water storage system will be made on a case by case basis by the Park Maintenance Supervisor.  b)	Schedule of Deliveries: Deliveries shall be made on weekdays between the hours of 7:00AM - 4:00PM, unless prior arrangements are made with the ordering official for weekend deliveries.
