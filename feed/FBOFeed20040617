<SUBJECT>B--Wenatchee IFIM Study  for river systems in the Wenatchee Subbasin with significant agricultural withdrawals, namely the mainstem Wenatchee River, Nason Creek, Chiwawa River, and Peshastin Creek.
<SOLNBR>04SQ1U0970
<ARCHDATE>06172005
<CONTACT>Steve Kolk Wenatchee Subbasin Liaison 5096678494     ;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Chelan County Washington. The proposed action is to assist The Upper Columbia Area Office (UCA), Bureau of Reclamation (USBR/Reclamation), Department of the Interior in technical and other services  in fulfilling its obligations under RPA 149 related to improved fish passage at diversion structures, improved fish protection devices on canals, and improved water measurement and control facilities. Wenatchee Basin IFIM Scope of Work In support of Reclamation?s 2000 FCRPS Bi-Op RPA 149 program, Reclamation will purchase an IFIM study for river systems in the Wenatchee Subbasin with significant agricultural withdrawals, namely the mainstem Wenatchee River, Nason Creek, Chiwawa River, and Peshastin Creek.  This data will be used to determine and prioritize the need for acquisition of instream flows for support of federally threatened and endangered species. The four stream systems shall be evaluated using the PHABSIM model, and recommended flows shall be established using the weighted usable area (WUA) curves derived therefrom.  WUAs shall be determined for spring Chinook, steelhead, and bull trout for all life stages.  Instream flow recommendations will be based on the WUA analysis in conjunction with flow exceedence curves. Tasks: Data Collection Select at least 35 transects on the mainstem Wenatchee River from Tumwater Canyon downstream to the mouth for a PHABSIM study.  Collect three Water Surface Elevations (WSEs) and one full calibration set of data at these transects. Select at least 7 transects for a PHABSIM study on Nason Creek.  Collect three WSEs and three full calibration data sets at these transects. Select at least 7 transects for a PHABSIM study on the Chiwawa River.  Collect three WSEs and three full calibration data sets at these transects. Select at least 9 transects for a PHABSIM study on Peshastin Creek.  Collect three WSEs and three full calibration data sets at these transects. All field work must be completed by the end of the 2004 water year. Modeling:Model and calibrate the depth, velocity, and WSE data collected on the Wenatchee River, Nason Creek, Chiwawa River, and Peshastin Creek.   Combine state HSI information with the hydraulic simulations to develop Weighted Usable Area and other indices of habitat for these systems. Analysis:Conduct any necessary additional habitat analysis and an alternatives analysis for determining recommended fish flows for the four Wenatchee subbasin stream systems. The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction as implemented by FAR 6.302-1/ Only one reasonable source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The cited authority must be used because only Chelan County  possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition: Chelan County is the only contractor able to provide the data required.  The report being requested from Chelan County is part of a much larger effort being undertaken pursuant to HB 2514, the Watershed Planning Act.  Chelan County, as the lead agency for watershed planning in WRIA 45 (Wenatchee), has been involved in the gathering of data and generation of widespread community support that will ultimately constitute a large portion of the IFIM study.  This methodology has four steps: Problem Identification and Stakeholder Involvement, Study Planning, Study Implementation (technical assessment), and Alternatives Analysis and Problem Resolution.  Chelan County has already contracted to complete the first two steps, and is now being asked by Reclamation to undertake the final two steps to provide the completed IFIM study. The Wenatchee Watershed, WRIA 45, is classified by the State of Washington as an over-appropriated basin where stream flows are critical to salmonid recovery.  There is a strong interest at the local level to participate in water resource management and specifically in an instream flow assessment.  Watershed Planning began under the Watershed Planning Act, Chapter 90.82 RCW, in the Wenatchee in 1999.  The Initiating Governments decided to investigate instream flows under Watershed Planning and the Planning Unit is now overseeing the study.  The Planning Unit is made up of a diverse group of stakeholders representing interests such as local governments, tribes, state and federal agencies, irrigation, agriculture, forestry, community groups, conservation groups, economic development, recreation, and individual landowners.   Chelan County is the lead agency for contracting purposes for the Planning Unit.  The County is uniquely positioned to not only continue its scientific work in determining instream flows required by endangered anadromous salmonids, but it also has and continues to generate support and draw input from the extremely diverse pool of stakeholders that have been involved in the process. The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the services listed above that will satisfy the agency needs. Any firm or individual that believes it can furnish the items described are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. All responses received by close of business June 21, 2004 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries will be accepted by Fax at (509) 454-5615, Attention: Connie Morgan or by electronic mail at cmorgan@pn.usbr.gov. Technical questions should be directed to Steve Kolk, Wenatchee Sub-basin Liaison 509-667-8494 or by cell phone 509-679-2856

<DESC>The Center for Mental Health Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (CMHS/SAMHSA) is proposing to award a three (3) year sole source contract to the Council of State Governments - the only known responsible source in accordance with FAR 6-302-1.  The purpose of this procurement is to develop a coalition designed to leverage collaborative change involving federal/state/and local collaborators towards the accomplishment of select goals established by the Council of State Governments (CSG) in the National Consensus Report on Mental Health and Criminal Justice Systems. 
 
The proposed work capitalizes on 10 years of CMHS investment with partners in the mental health/criminal justice field where action-oriented change has been the goal. This ability to build and sustain policy networks for the purpose of policy and innovation development is a singular requirement in this contract. The successful offeror for this work must demonstrate the most complete knowledge and experience possible in the conception, implementation, and publication and policy and practice follow with the National Consensus Report on Mental Health and Criminal Justice Systems. These capacities include: convening government leaders in a bi-partisan manner to engage in policy analysis, consensus, and follow-though activities; strength in engagement of key Federal, state, and local representatives and the constituencies involved in these systems; development of successful policies that are specifically targeted to address improvements in services delivery systems; and a sophisticated mix of analysis and implementation skills needed to accomplish these tasks are necessary to successful contract implementation
The purpose of this contract is to apply directed technical assistance to support the formation of new collaborative Federal/state/local coalitions to address goals contained in the National Consensus Report that have not yet been addressed. This contract will provide an efficient means for CMHS to address goals, which have not yet been fully addressed, and will provide a proactive and timely basis to do so. Outcomes are based on the successful creation and sustenance of three new collaborative entities to address the following goals/problems of establishing: 1) economic forecasting for costs/benefits for a given state or locality; 2) maintenance of Federal benefits for persons in the criminal justice system; and 3) victim/survivor compensation and access to services for victims through the criminal justice system. Specific tasks will include – development of principles and strategies for provision of policy and practice leadership and oversight, crafting a common vision and assessment of barriers to progress, and defining alternate pathways for the integration of funding streams and regulations as proves to be necessary – for each of the three goal areas.
CSG is uniquely qualified to accomplish the contract tasks because it coordinates and serves as a bi-partisan representative voice for state legislators and state executive officials bearing responsibility for the range of issues under the purview of state legislatures. GSG is also uniquely qualified because of its track record on creating resource synergy amongst partners in the mental health and criminal justice system through brokering new alliances; 2) repeated success in building and sustaining National Networks as demonstrated through the work of the National Consensus Report; and 3) CSG’s established knowledge application capacities to inform issues through information intensive dissemination of needed knowledge for the topics under development for this contract. 

Accordingly, it is the intent of SAMHSA to award a three (3)-year, cost reimbursement type contract to this organization. This announcement is for informational purposes only. No solicitation is available. Send written responses to the point of contact identified below, referencing 280-04-0123. Contact information is as follows: Linda Tillery 301-443-0043, Ltillery@samhsa.gov.

Proposals from a team of university investigators may be warranted because the necessary expertise in addressing the multiple facets of the topics may reside in different universities, or in different departments in the same university.  By supporting multidisciplinary teams, the program is complementary to other DoD basic research programs that support university research through single-investigator awards.  Proposals must name one Principal Investigator as the responsible technical point of contact.  Similarly, one institution will be the primary awardee for the purpose of award execution.  The relationship among participating institutions and their respective roles, as well as the apportionment of funds including sub-awards, if any, must be described in both the proposal text and the budget.

Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MIs) (as defined by 10 U.S.C. 2323a (1) (c)) are encouraged to participate in the MURI program, either as the lead institution or as a member of a team.  However, no specific funds are allocated for HBCU/MI participation.  The White Papers due date is 12 AUG 2004, and the Full Proposals due date is 18 NOV 2004.

• Educators will receive materials suitable for their school district technological capabilities including Teacher Guide with presentation materials and interactive CD-ROM. 

• Educators will receive specialized training and follow-up technical support that includes accreditation units (continuing professional development units and continuing education units) that contribute to state teacher certification requirements.

Tasks:

(2)Field-test the Beta CD-ROM in middle grades classrooms in select Illinois and Maryland schools.

(3)Finish the draft Beta CD to a final version.

All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 15-days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for services to be procurred under FAR part 15.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Ensco, Inc., cage code 06359, on behalf of the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Reactor Products Program (RPP), for Data Evaluation Support (DES) and Laboratory Quality Assurance/Quality Control Services (QA/QC).  A sources sought notice that outlined specific program details was previously released under the solicitation number shown above.  A fixed price contract with a one-year period of performance is contemplated.  This contract will be a one year “bridge” needed to synchronize the expiration of multiple contracts, after which, these requirements will be re-aligned to allow competitive procurement of as many tasks as practical.  This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  There are three primary circumstances that led to this determination.  (1) DES involves the operation and maintenance of numerous in-house systems developed for AFTAC's unique mission.  The majority of these systems are used and modified by several AFTAC directorates for their own unique purposes.  Ensco, Inc. is currently performing services for other directorates to modify and use these models on another contract.  It would not be practical or possible for two contractors to perform maintenance and modifications to these programs at the same time. (2) Technical analysis of the time required to learn and become proficient in the operation and maintenance of DES code and to become proficient in performing the in depth nuclear QA/QC services would require an extended phase in period that would lead to a substantial duplication of costs that would not be warranted given the one year duration of the anticipated contract.  (3) Other than the incumbent contractor, no firms currently possess the requisite experience and knowledge to perform the nuclear laboratory QA/QC function.  Future contracts for these services are being contemplated for FY06 and beyond.  It is anticipated that a significant portion of the AFTAC Data Evaluation Support services will be procured on a competitive basis at that time.  In order to promote competition for these services, the computer code for the DES software will be made available in the near future.  Interested firms may obtain a copy by contacting Ms. Michelle Raines at 321-494-7320.   Solicitation No. FA2521-04-R-0028 will be issued as a Request for Proposal.  This procurement will be conducted without set-aside, on an unrestricted basis.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690 and the Small Business size standard is $6.0 million.  No solicitation documents exists at this time.  The 45th Contracting Squadron has determined that Ensco, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the necessary services.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort in its entirety should provide evidence of capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Colorado – Boulder, Physics Department (Dr. Neil Ashby, PI) to set up and carry out experiments to study the fundamental limits to coherence when implementing quantum gates based on stimulated-Raman transitions.  ***Over the past few years, NIST has initiated a program in quantum information processing.  The Ion Storage Group of the Time and Frequency division has demonstrated all of the basic elements of quantum computation with the system of trapped atomic ions.  The development of quantum computers has become a national priority, because if one can be built, it would enable efficient decryption of data that has been encoded using a method that has been commonly used for the last 20 years.  Based upon close contact with all groups throughout the world that perform this type of work, the Ion-Storage group believes that Dr. Ashby and his colleagues are unique in  the specific aspects needed for the proposed study.  Further, the NIST facilities in Boulder are world-class and could not be duplicated elsewhere in a reasonable time or at a reasonable cost.***  Work will include the following tasks: (1) Experimentally establish the limits of decoherence caused by spontaneous emission during stimulated-Raman transitions using 9Be+ ions as quantum bits; (2) establish the scaling of the ratio of the rate of spontaneous emission to Rabi rate with detuning of the lasers from 9Be+ fine-structure levels; (3) develop a theoretical model to explain the observed results; (4) establish the optimum conditions and atomic-ion species to maximize the coherence performance of an ion-trap-based quantum information processor.  This small purchase acquisition (NTE $100K) is being conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.1.  No solicitation is available.  Responses to this notice must be received no later than July 2, 2004 and will be evaluated solely to determine if a competitive procurement process will be in the Government’s best interest.  Terms and Conditions can be found on http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm.  A copy in full text available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date July 6, 2004.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Low Emissions Alternative Power (LEAP) Organization will solicit proposals in the form of a NASA Research Announcement (NRA).  The NRA is for innovative and focused research and development in the follow areas: 1) fuel cell technologies addressing either conventional aircraft hydrocarbon fuels or hydrogen, 2) hydrogen storage and feed systems for aircraft, and 3) electric drive propulsion and power management for aircraft.   Technologies will be targeted across the range of aircraft types, from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to commercial transports.  Aircraft applications for these new technologies require significantly higher specific power, lower weight, longer life, and greater reliability than ground or space based applications.  As a result, NASA is seeking “break-through” technologies instead of evolutionary improvement to current state-of-the-art.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 1,500 employees, respectively.	 The anticipated release date of the NRA is on or about July 6, 2004 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about October 6, 2004. Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested.  Please send the notices directly to Gynelle Steele (contact information listed below).	  Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposal selected pursuant to this announcement. Obtain additional programmatic information from: Gynelle Steele; 21000 Brookpark Rd. MS: 4-8, Cleveland, OH 44135; (216) 433-8258; Gynelle.C.Steele@nasa.gov  .	 Participation is open to industry, educational institutions, and small businesses.  Collaboration with NASA GRC is welcome; cost sharing and in-kind contributions are welcome.  More information will be provided in the NRA solicitation (number NRA-04-GRC-LEAP-01) to be posted on this website. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/GRC Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=22  Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intend to negotiate under FAR Part 13 – SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS PROCEDURES on sole source basis with Quality Resources Systems, Inc. (QRS), 11350 Random Hills Road, Suite 100, Fairfax, VA   22030
The NAICS Code is 541618 with a small business standard of $6 million. This acquisition is to provide services to test the relationship between Title VII supported medical schools and residencies in graduate medical schools and residencies in graduate medical education in the production of primary care physicians, both overall and for those choosing to practice in rural and medically underserved communities. Primary care is defined as those physicians in clinical practice trained in family medicine, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics. The project is designed to measure the effectiveness of these programs over time and will be national in scope.  The study will determine whether primary care physicians who practice in underserved and rural areas are more likely to have trained in schools and postgraduate residency programs receiving Title VII funding than physicians.  QRS is the sole owner of the enhanced 1999 American Medical Associations (AMA) Masterfile required to conduct this study.  The Masterfile has been augmented by data provided by QRS on physicians' training histories, the names of their medically schools and years of matriculation and graduation, intuitions where the physicians' received their postgrade training and the physicians' current practice location.     There currently is no other Masterfile available to retrieve this type of data required to perform this service.  Any other organization that attempts to development this type of masterfile would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.  This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  Therefore, Quality Resources Systems, Inc. is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S.C. 253 ( c ), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (B) (1).

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA), Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI) contemplates contracting with OAG Worldwide for data sets of travel information.

The Department of Commerce (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA), Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI), has been for over 20 years obtaining "Current Day Schedule" data files from the Official Airline Guide (OAG). One of the major programs for OTTI is the survey of International air travelers. To conduct this research, OTTI selects a sample of international departing flights from the United States. To select the sample, on a monthly basis, OTTI requires a listing of all international flights for all airports. Currently, specific flights are selected by simple random sampling, using the monthly Official Airline Guide (OAG) roster of flights as the universe. To develop this sample, OTTI requires an electronic file of the OAG database.

 In addition to providing flight specific information, OTTI also requires a file that contains the code-share information for the month as well. This information is used to eliminate the majority of the code-shares before the final sample is selected. There are two types of files obtained from OAG. They are Current Day Itinerary File and the Code Share File. 

In addition, to ensure the airline codes used by OAG are current, OTTI also requires the OAG code reports.  As new airlines and airports are added to the OAG system, OTTI uses this information to update the coding system for the 
In-Flight  Survey  for the I-92 program. 

Without access to this file, OTTI would have unknown codes that will not be properly allocated and skew the results of the data.

Additionally, OAG has developed a unique electronic format of this data set that is specific for programs at OTTI; therefore, the system over many years has been developed and improvements have been made to provide for compatibility. 

This information is sent to OTTI to be used for the Survey of International Air Travelers. The data is provided  as a database with information on all international scheduled flights departing the United States each month. The comprehensive information for all airlines and all U.S. and foreign airports data is required to select a flight sample. In addition, the arrivals and departures data received for all international flights for all airlines and airports is required in providing the coding and tracking data for the I-92 program. 

This a continuation of work that is ongoing for the Department of Commerce, (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA), Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI). It is imperative that this acquisition be completed in order to 
Provide the necessary data for business travelers, corporations and the global travel industry; the information is required in order to make effective travel planning decisions. 

Therefore, based on the above information, the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism Industries has determined that it would be in the best interest of the Government to contract, on a sole source basis for continuation of on-going work,  with OAG Worldwide, 2000 Clearwater Drive, Oak Brook, Illinois.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Field Support Command, Rock Island, IL intends to award, under the authority of FAR 6.302-3, Industrial mobilization or engineering, development, or research capability, an Engineering Design Contract to NI Industries for the design of a new Flexible Production Line at Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant (RBAAP).     This flexible manufacturing facility is for a projectile/mortar metal parts and new 250 lb penetrating bomb production line by modernizing an existing manufacturing line at the RBAAP located in Riverbank, CA.  The updated manufacturing facility will have  the capability of producing both projectile/mortar metal parts ranging from 57mm to 120mm inclusive of the newly developed 105mm family of munitions and new 250 lb penetrating bomb for current and future combat systems (FCS) to meet Army Transformation Ob jectives.  This effort will entail utilizing existing government-owned equipment, augmented with new equipment which, when completed, will represent the latest technological advances in the manufacturing of these metal parts.   This phase of the project will provide for the design, production line layout, equipment specifications and possibly initial relocation of existing equipment.  Science based production methodologies and six sigma tools will be utilized in the design and implementation of this flexible manufacturing facility.   The latest Technical Data Packages (TDPS) for items to be produced on this flexible manufacturing line will be provided through ARDEC support to the project.  These TDPS will aid the design process in determining equipment design parameters, operations, and production rates.   Notes 9 and 22 apply.

<DESC>The U.S. Census Bureau is approaching two key milestones for the Decennial Response Integration System (DRIS): a release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry on June 30, 2004 and a vendor conference on July 15, 2004.   The following includes: 1) Information about the draft RFP, including how to submit questions, and 2) what to do to attend the vendor conference.    

1) The U.S. Census Bureau will post a copy of the draft DRIS RFP, or minimally Sections B, C, F, J, L and M, on the following website (add the URL for the website) on June 30.You may submit questions or recommendations by email between July 1 and July 23, 2004.   Please email your questions to dscmo.2010.dris@census.gov.   We will post all questions anonymously on this website and include our responses.   All questions will be answered by August 20, 2004.   

2) The Census Bureau will host a vendor conference on July 15, 2004 on the upcoming DRIS acquisition. The agenda includes the following:

·	Overview of the acquisition as currently planned, 
·	Census Bureau's unique security issues and requirements, and 
·	Open forum for Q&A with Census Bureau DRIS subject matter experts.   

At the vendor conference you will also be able to get a copy of a paper test deck, dubbed the Digital Test Deck (DTD), that we created to demonstrate the expected complexity of paper data capture for the 2010 Census.  While the forms are in no way final, the Digital Test Deck (DTD) will be representative of possible 2010 Census form colors and will contain simulated data with computer-generated pen and pencil marks.  This test deck will only be available at the vendor conference, and only those who submit written requests for a copy of the test deck will be given one.  (Note: Copies must be requested in writing before the conference as described below.)   One set of the test deck forms is available per company.   

Please be sure to R.S.V.P. on behalf of your company and provide the names of each person attending from your company. Send the email to dscmo.2010.dris@census.gov or call 301.763.8439.  Also indicate on the email if you would like a copy of the DTD.

<CONTACT>Erik Urban, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)882-9391 x5043, Fax (850)882-3130, Email erik.urban@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>The Range Instrumentation Systems Office, Air Combat Support, Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida (AAC/YBR), in concert with Air Combat Command (ACC), is requesting information and interested sources for participation in the Next Generation Range Instrumentation (NexRI) Program.  NexRI is intended to address inherent interoperability constraints in the current Range Instrumentation acquisition and fielding process.  The current product-based acquisition approach is not conducive to being coordinated with aircraft acquisition or weapon system upgrades.  The result is forever playing a “catch up” game to support training of new tactical capabilities.  NexRI is a program to: (1) Develop a set of open standards to allow acquisition/integration of interoperable air combat training range instrumentation from multiple sources, (2) Develop and operate a conformance testing suite to certify compliance of a candidate range instrumentation with NexRI standards, and (3) Validate completeness and accuracy of the standards by developing a reference model and testing the standards for compliance.  ACC tasked Standard Research Institute (SRI) International to lead a study to definitize the NexRI Program approach and create a plan for NexRI standards development.  This study clarifies the scope of the NexRI Program and develops the foundation for further NexRI development.  The NexRI Scope Definition and Phase 0 Study Results reports are available through the Aerial Targets Information Management System (ATIMS).  ATIMS access is subject to export control laws and regulations.  Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be granted access to ATIMS.  Contact the Battle Creek Customer Contact Center, Defense Logistics Information Service, 74 Washington Avenue N., Battle Creek, Michigan 40917-3084 (1-877-352-2255) for further information on the certification process.  Requests for an ATIMS account for this procurement can be made via internet at https://atims1.hill.af.mil/.  Register for NexRI Program.  You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, concurrent with your request for ATIMS access to: Erik Urban, Contract Specialist, AAC/YBRK, 102 West D Avenue, Bldg 11, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6808; Fax 850-882-3226; erik.urban@eglin.af.mil.   The Government plans to stimulate industry involvement by providing industry the NexRI vision, soliciting industry suggestions on how to implement NexRI development, and defining and evaluating NexRI standards through an Industry consortium.  The Government is in the very early stages of this acquisition and is soliciting membership from qualified organizations to establish a consortium including all interested training community and producer parties as a potential next step.  The consortium would be the working level group developing and disseminating open standards for NexRI to ensure inter- and intra-range interoperability among air combat training instrumentation systems, combat aircraft and weapon systems.  The future of NexRI is likely to include joint, international, and testing aspects.  AAC/YBR anticipates conducting an Industry Day in August 2004 to facilitate information exchange between the Air Force and interested industry partners.  To initiate exchange of information the Government requests interested parties submit any or both of the following: (1) expression of interest in participating in a NexRI consortium, or (2) alternative concepts for improving the Range Instrumentation acquisition process.  This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to conduct any follow-on acquisitions.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI.  The Government recognizes proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  For further information concerning technical aspects contact Mr. Walt Schmidt at (850) 882-9514 x2064.  Responses to this RFI should be sent to AAC/YBR, 102 West D Avenue, Bldg 11, Suite 373, Eglin AFB FL 32542-5000, Attn:  Mr. Bruce Melusen, bruce.melusen2@eglin.af.mil, Commercial 850-882-9391 x2228 , or faxed to 850-882-3130 no later than 15 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command is issuing this sources sought synopsis to develop and acquire a Periscope Detection Radar (PDR) capability designated as Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD).  The ARPDD will replace the legacy Periscope Detection (ASW) mode of the AN/APS-137D(V)5 radar incorporating Government-developed ARPDD technology within the existing radar footprint.  The ARPDD will provide the Fleet with a greatly enhanced periscope mode that automatically detects and discriminates submarine periscope/communication/Electronic Support Measures (ESM) mast exposures, with low false alarms, and alerts the operator, to maximize mission effectiveness without degrading legacy radar modes.  ARPDD components shall be Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Item (NDI), or modified COTS/NDI that have been previously demonstrated in an aircraft environment to the extent possible.  The ARPDD system architecture shall align with the DoD Global Information Grid (GIG) and the P-3C AIP weapon system as required to deliver a fully integrated capability, including support for requisite Information Assurance and Net-Ready requirements.  In addition, associated ground-based training system and logistics support will be updated to address ARPDD.  It is contemplated that a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) contract with a base year and four one-year options will be awarded to develop, integrate, test, and deliver ARPDD, including two Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and four Test Articles (TAs), and options for Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units up to the approved quantity, as well as training, logistics support assets, and technical data as required. Interested parties shall submit a capabilities package to Laura.Sells@navy.mil.  See Note 25.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business Concerns with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of the following research on the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first 3-6 months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience, risk taking, or other factors (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). Teen passengers, night, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) policies, now in place in most states, appear to reduce crash risks mainly by delaying licensure and possibly by reducing exposure to risk conditions.  One effect of GDL may be to increase parental management of teen drivers. With or without GDL, there appears to be great potential for increasing parental management of novice young drivers (Simons-Morton & Hartos, 2003).  Previous research has demonstrated that it is possible to increase adoption of a parent-teen driving agreement and reduced exposure to high risk driving conditions during the first 12 months after licensure (Simons-Morton et al., 2002, 2003, 2004, in press).  The PRB plans to conduct a series of studies designed to determine effective ways of increasing parental management of teen driving.  The research would address the following research objectives, with initial (1-6 months post-licensure) novice young driver experience as the outcome in all cases:  (1) Determine the most effective approaches (in terms of source, timing, and content) to the delivery of persuasive communications.  (2) Assess the relative effects of intervention to increase parental management of initial teen driving when delivered at the time of permit or at the time of licensure. (3) Evaluate the extent to which intervention to increase parental management of teen driving can be delivered effectively as part of routine department of motor vehicle driver licensing practice. (4) Evaluate the effect of intervention to increase parental management of teen driving when integrated into driver education. 

To be deemed capable, a small business must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates the ability to:  1) organize, conduct, and manage effectiveness trials involving the collection of data from multiple sources (include evidence of the ability to develop a detailed Manual of Operating Procedures); 2) organize, conduct, and manage methods development and pilot studies; 3) identify and recruit study participants; 4) assist the PRB in preparation of materials to be submitted for required reports and clearances for the IRB, OMB, etc.; 5) monitor the quality of data collection, editing, auditing, and entry; 6) develop and implement quality control procedures, including audits of field data collection procedures; 7) train and certify data collectors in each of the Study sites; 8) establish working relationships with state and local Department of Motor Vehicle, driver education, and other officials as needed; 9) prepare data for statistical analyses, as needed; 10) participate in the preparation of scientific articles and reports.

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541720.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is $6 million or less in annual receipts. For the calculation of annual receipts see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBA's Small Business Size Regulations.

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Charles Newman at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on July 19, 2004.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable Small Business Concerns, the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for Small Businesses only.

The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group within the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of research emphasis is the prevention of motor vehicle crashes among young drivers.  Young drivers are at greatly elevated risk for motor vehicle crashes, and these risks are particularly elevated during the first 3-6 months and 1000 miles of independent driving, regardless of the amount of supervised practice driving prior to licensure and age of licensure (McCartt et al., 2003).  This may be due to age/inexperience, risk taking, or other factors (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). Teen passengers, nighttime, distracting activities, and other factors can increase crash risks for novice teen drivers (Doherty et al., 1998).  Little is known about how driving experience effects these risks (Williams & Ferguson, 2002). There is a need to develop a better understanding about the nature of novice young driver risk and also to determine how best to foster improvements in family management of young drivers.  Therefore, the PRB plans to examine aspects of teen driving risk by conducting a series of studies in specially-equipped vehicles on a research track/roadway designed for studies of this sort.  The objectives of the research are: (1) Determine the extent to which driving performance and risk are due to driving inexperience? (2) Determine the extent to which distracting activities, for example, the in car use of electronic devices, affect driving performance, identify sources of distraction, and assess variation among novice and experienced young drivers, males and females, and among high and low risk takers? (3) Evaluate the extent to which the effect of distraction on driving performance varies in the absence and presence of teen passengers among novice and more experienced teenaged drivers.  

To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate the following abilities: 1) access at least one vehicle specially equipped for testing driving performance and a test track designed for in-car driving studies of this sort; 2) organize, and manage driving risk assessment trials; 3) conduct tests of driving-related perception and motor skills; 4) identify and recruit adolescent study participants for driving studies; 5) monitor the quality of data collection, editing, auditing, and entry; 6) develop and implement quality control procedures, including rapid audits of field data collection procedures; 7) train and certify data collectors; 8) establish working relationships with state and local Department of Motor Vehicle and other officials; 9) prepare and analyze data from driving studies; 10) participate in the preparation of scientific articles and reports on teen driving performance.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT-- This is not a request for proposals. Defense Contracting Command Washington on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Per Diem, Travel, Transportation and Allowance Committee, is conducting a market survey in accordance wi th the Feder al Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to determine the extent of Small Business participation and capability to perform a requirement to provide cost of living price data services in accordance with Federal law and Army regulations and p olicies.    The NAICS code is 561499; size standard is $6M.  The CONUS COLA Program focuses on non-housing cost-of-living data.  For the contract, the company should have long-term in-depth expertise in providing data related to non-housing cost-of-living,  especially in generating median city indexes and aggregations.  An expected turn around time is normally 30 days to collect and provide requested data for up to 500 locations simultaneously.  The company should already be providing this in-depth capabilit y to its other customers.  The contract shall provide current off-the-shelf non-housing cost-of-living data to a wide and sophisticated customer base.  The law governing this program requires an index developed in the private sector, i.e., civilian, rather  than military.  Therefore, a firm is being sought that is able to develop data  in-house with customers  with similar requirements to the US Government (USG).  USG generated data (for example, Bureau of Labor Statistics) will be rejected.  The project is identified as follows:   Section 403B to Title 37, U.S. Code allows the Secretary of Defense to pay a cost-of-living allowance to Service members in high cost areas in the continental United States.  Contractor support is required to obtain detailed local market cost data for numerous locations in the United States to support this allowance.  The contractor is to provide an annual update of the cost of living data.  The program office could request data for up to 500 locations for delivery within 30 days. The data will be for specified locations, family size, income size, housing status and time frame.  Major cost categories to be provided will be taxation (federal, FICA, state, local and sales), transportation (public commutation and operation and maintena nce costs of automobiles), goods and services, housing and miscellaneous expenses.  Within the goods and services category, indexes will be provided for components:  food at home, food away from home, tobacco, alcohol, furnishings and household operations,  domestic service, clothing, personal care, medical care, and recreation.  Collection and analysis of living cost data must be in accordance with industry standards.  The living cost data requested per location will be either standard/off-the-shelf cost da ta, special/unique benchmark pricing data, special/unique full pricing cost data, or specially requested pricing.  Standard statistical/economic methodology will be used to adjust collected data to that time frame for the base year of the contract.  The co ntractor must be able to provide required data for any U.S. location Ã¢Â€Â“ not just large cities.  The contractor will produce cost data for each location for the specified family size, income levels, housing status, number of automobiles and time frame t o be used in comparison of costs and/or indexes in each cost category relative to costs in the Standard City location.

<SUBJECT>69 -- Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS) Spiral
<DESC>Range Instrumentation Systems, Air Combat Support, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), Florida, is contemplating a series of contracts to Cubic Defense Applications, Inc. (CDA), 9333 Balboa Avenue, San Diego, California 92123, for the integration of additional tactical information to support combined/coalition training and to provide infrastructure/life cycle upgrades into the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS).  This recurring requirement will be called the NACTS Spiral and will include a series of spiral upgrades through FY2012.  Each development requirement executed under the NACTS Spiral will be accomplished with individual firm fixed price contracts each with a period of performance between 12-18 months.  The NACTS Spiral will build upon the basic NACTS and subsequent upgrades; NACTS Range Security Initiative (RSI), NACTS Range Security Upgrade (RSU) and NACTS Range Security Enhancement (RSE) and NACTS Spiral FY04 (NS-04).  The NACTS Spiral will require information and data being developed under these efforts to include CDA proprietary information.  NACTS Spiral will be implemented over several years to ensure NACTS remains a functional and operational range supporting combined/coalition training through 2012.  The NACTS Spiral will encompass 1) integration of additional tactical information (baseline changes to Aircraft Operational Flight Programs, integration of additional weapon simulations, integration of F-22 & F-35 training information) and 2) NACTS life cycle and infrastructure upgrades (upgrading the Computation and Simulation sub-system, developing/integrating a common display, enhanced pod/ground system security, upgraded pod shop replaceable assemblies).  CDA is uniquely capable of performing the required tasks since they developed, installed, and modified the existing training system under NACTS.  CDA’s extensive knowledge of NACTS including their current development efforts, allows CDA to satisfy the Air Force’s requirements for the future spiral development efforts.  All solutions must be interoperable and compatible with existing NACTS operations and maintenance equipment developed by CDA.  This directly applies to CDA’s proprietary Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS), which is fundamental to NACTS.  Due to in-depth system knowledge, limited Government owned technical data and proprietary aspects of NACTS, only CDA can effectively and efficiently accomplish the NACTS Spiral effort.  Information associated with this effort is unclassified, or classified up to, and including, SECRET.  Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Karen S. Turner, karen.turner@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5053, FAX (850) 882-3226 or Contracting Specialist, Mr. Erik Urban, erik.urban@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9391 x 5043.  Technical questions should be directed to the Program Manager, Mr. Vince Consentino, vincent.consentino@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-9307 x 5121.  For potential subcontracting opportunities at CDA, contact Mr. Don Jacobs at (858) 505-2052.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management intends to issue a follow-on sole-source, firm-fixed price five year blanket purchase agreement to Dr. Frank Ponti, to provide consulting services in the areas of statistical sampling and cohort analysis to assist in the annual audit of the agency’s financial statements for the Center of Retirement and Insurance Service.  

Description:  The contractor will be required to provide primary statistical support using the dollar unit sampling method, and in support of the deliverables described below, the contractor must accomplish the following tasks: Development of the sampling plan and selection; Preparing the population of the review, select sample data and random numbers; Participate in Entrance Conference with Auditor, QAG staff and CRIS management; Respond to inquiries in various forms to facilitate audit execution; Identify potential sources of data that could be used as audit evidence considering the validity and reliability of the data; Estimate underpayment and overpayment error for the population; Estimate/project errors associated with the 1-month, 1-year and 35 year cohort strata, ensuring OMB sampling requirements are met and adhering to applicable legal and regulatory requirements; Provide guidance and revision on spreadsheet / quantitative calculations; Identify significant findings and recommendations, considering both current and prior audit results; Construct report table from the spreadsheet; Prepare a written report; Attend, consult, advise during additional meetings, as needed; Ad Hoc analyses and requests from CRIS management . 

The Contractor has a unique combination of skills, experiences and expertise needed to assist CRIS’ Quality Assurance Group in its responsibilities in support of KPMG’s annual audit of OPM’s financial statements. An important component of this audit (and obtaining a clean opinion) is our ability to provide an assurance that the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Trust Funds are not materially misstated and are adequate to meet the liability of future retiree and survivor annuity payments.  Beyond statistical calculations, the analysis needed to make this assertion requires knowledge of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees’ Retirement System (FERS) as well as familiarity with the internal control procedures by which CRIS operates.  Additionally, since various systems are used to calculate federal retirement benefits, potentially affecting their accuracy, an additional familiarity is required of OPM’s mainframe and stand-alone computational systems used to adjudicate CSRS and FERS retiree and survivor benefits.

The Contractor’s support to QAG may require statistical sampling, stratification by retirement plan, month, year, cohort, computation method and erroneous payment type, for which requisite expertise is not available internally.  Absent the requisite federal retirement, organizational and systems expertise, it is likely that CRIS would have to dedicate additional resources and/or time in order to meet its obligations at even greater expense.

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit in writing, within 15 days of publication of this notice, complete information describing their ability to provide these services.  Such information should contain pricing information for providing these services.  The Government will not pay for information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested vendors are requested to contact the OPM Contracting Officer, Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax 202 606-0910.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for non-personal services prepared in accordance with the format in subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notic e.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested from GSA HOLDERS.  No formal solicitation will be issued but a statement of Objective follows below.  This is a ONE (1) YEAR, THREE (3) OPTION YEARS firm fixed price acq uisition.  The objective is to provide the National Guard Bureau (NGB) AGILE LOGISTICS AND AIR FORCE REPAIR ENHANCEMENT  PROGRAM CONTRACT SUPPORT TO THE AIR NATIONAL GUARD (ANG) 1.0  BACKGROUND The ANG has over 80 operational units across the United States responsible for maintaining more than 1,000 military aircraft in a combat ready condition.  Historically, the ANG has utilized three distinct levels of maintenance to keep aircraft in peak oper ational condition.  Field level, or on-aircraft, maintenance is designed as the first level of maintenance.  In field-level maintenance, repairs are made on the aircraft as it sits on the flight line.  Inoperable systems are removed from the aircraft and r eplaced with new or repaired parts, to return the aircraft to service as quickly as possible.  Intermediate-level maintenance utilizes base-level shops with more sophisticated machinery and support equipment operated by specialized personnel to repair comp onents that cannot be repaired on the aircraft.  The black boxes that house electrical components are disassembled and circuit cards are removed and replaced to return the systems to operational status.  These first two levels of maintenance are performed at the base level and offer the greatest potential for quickly returning an aircraft to operational status.  Depot-level maintenance is performed at a central consolidated repair facility, usually far removed from the operational unit.  Here extensive peri odic maintenance is performed that cannot be done at base-level because of insufficient manning or expertise.  Due to the extended shipping distances and heavy workloads performed at the depots, depot repairs are lengthy and costly compared to those perfor med at base-level. To improve efficiency, reduce costs and improve aircraft operational readiness rates, the ANG has initiated efforts to eliminate depot level maintenance on as many aircraft components as possible and perform all maintenance functions for those components a t base-level.  This will reduce maintenance activities for those components from three levels of maintenance (3LM) to two levels of maintenance (2LM), and it has the potential to generate significant savings in maintenance costs for ANG units.  To assure t hat these savings are realized, extensive planning must be done on which components will be selected for conversion.  This will include planning and coordination for facilities, equipment and personnel necessary to make the repairs.  Data will be gathered,  analyzed and maintained to document improvements in the maintenance processes and to make further changes, as necessary. 2.0  OBJECTIVES The objectives of this project are as follows:   The overall objective of this task is to provide the ANGRC with on-site technical expertise to assist ANG managers in planning and executing the transition of Level of Maintenance codes for avionics parts and collecting and analyzing data for repair initia tives in support of the Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP).   Establish a focal point within the ANG to work and resolve organizational, functional and technical issues pertaining to the 2LM and AFREP programs. Prioritize which aircraft components  are best suited for transition to 2LM or 3LM based on greatest potential for cost savings.  Evaluate the potential impact on aircraft readiness, facilities, equipment   and personnel caused by the transition of selected components to 2LM or 3LM. Recommend modifications to existing automated data collection systems       to mitigate the adverse impact of these changes on operational units.  Develop standards of performance that depict the current 2LM performance of respective weapon systems, and, if required, support equipment items and components, as well. Develop appropriate metrics to collect, track and analyze Air Force 2LM/Repair Enhancement data.  Use this data to document and maintain current criteria for analyzing candidate items being considered for conversion. 3.0	TASK This SOO describes the ANG objectives to analyze, plan and execute the steps required to move ANG maintenance units from three levels of maintenance (3LM) to two levels of maintenance (2LM) at some units, while at other units we will encourage the transiti on from 2LM to 3LM.

<DESC>Due to limitations with the FedBizOpps website, the SOW referenced in the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis could not be uploaded.  It is provided here, instead.

The purpose of this Statement Of Work (SOW) is to procure an asset tracking system to the Dignitary Protection Division/Candidate Nominee Protection Section.

Requirements.  
The United States Secret Service (USSS) has a requirement for an asset tracking system to interface with existing barcodes and readers/scanners.  The system should be a commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) system requiring little, or no, USSS-specific changes.  The software shall consist of a database to track property being checked-out and –in at various events, as needed.  The data shall be uploaded and refreshed in real time, to a USSS-hosted intranet site.  No additional hardware is needed.  The ability for USSS personnel to modify the database (tables, forms, etc.) on an as-needed basis is also required. 

1.  MUST BE WEB BASED:  A 100% web-based system is required.  The software is installed on one central computer, and can be accessed by any computer that is connected to that central computer (most likely through a LAN or WAN).  The USSS would require a site-license for as many users as needed to access the system.  Users can access the program from any computer connected to the network, thus eliminating the need for installing the software on every individual computer that will be used to issue, receive or track property.

2.  MUST BE BARCODE TECHNOLOGY COMPATIBLE:  The property tracking system that DPD Credentialing has developed utilizes existing barcodes that have been placed on all accountable property, in conjunction with barcodes on all event credentials.  This enables us to issue property to an individual by scanning the barcode on the credential (indicating who is being issued the property) and then scanning the barcode on the property itself (indicating the SSPN of the property that is being issued).  This allows us to link the individual to the property that is being issued to him/her.  The system shall provide a barcode module that allows the user to scan property using existing barcode scanners, thus eliminating the need to physically type the relevant information into the system.

3.  MUST BE ABLE TO SCAN OUT MULTIPLE ITEMS IN A SINGLE TRANSACTION:  During the course of USSS events, it may be necessary for people to be issued multiple pieces of equipment.  A system that allows the user to scan the barcode on the credential, and then scan multiple property items in a single transaction is required.  A system requiring scanning the credential and each item individually is unacceptable.  A credential shall be able to be scanned, and then all property to be issued (with no upper limit to the amount of property) without having to end the transaction until all property has been accounted for.

4.  MUST BE ABLE TO SCAN OUT ITEMS TO MULTIPLE SITES:  The ability to issue property from more than one location is also required.  Issuing property from the “warehouse” and subsequently reissue from a second (or third, etc.) location to other individuals.  

5.  MUST BE ABLE TO PINPOINT THE CURRENT LOCATION OF ALL PROPERTY:  In order to keep track of all property before, during and after an event, we need to be able to pinpoint the location the property in ‘real-time.’  The ability to generate reports to list all property that is currently signed out, to whom, when and ‘due-date’/overdue status is needed.  This function is invaluable, as the ability to determine which pieces of property have not been returned and who is in possession of said property.  Reports shall also be generated to list all property (or types of property) available for issue.

6.  MUST BE ABLE TO DOCUMENT THE HISTORY OF ALL PROPERTY:  The system shall track every individual transaction that a given piece of property has undergone.   The ability to create a “paper trail” that lists each individual or location that the property was issued and when is necessary.

7.  MUST BE ABLE TO EASILY ADD OR REMOVE PROPERTY FROM THE SYSTEM

8.  MUST BE ABLE TO EASILY ADD OR REMOVE PERSONNEL FROM THE SYSTEM

9.  MUST BE ABLE TO INDICATE WHETHER PROPERTY IS AVAILABLE FOR USE, OR IS CURRENTLY IN USE:  The ability to designate any location as a “warehouse” location is required.  This means that all property listed as being stationed at the “warehouse” will have a designation of “unassigned”.  When the property is issued out from the warehouse, the designation will automatically change to “in-use”.  If the aforementioned property is then re-issued to another person, the designation will still be “in-use”.  However, when the property is returned to the warehouse location, the designation for that property will automatically change from “In-use” to “unassigned”.  This allows for the generation of reports that can indicate the status of all property that is currently “in-use”, or at the warehouse and “unassigned”.  

System Requirements: Unlimited Number of Users; 10 Concurrent Staff Licenses; Reside on USSS system; 	Compatible with existing USSS barcodes and barcode readers/scanners; Section 508 Compliant.

Training and Support:  Initial training for 10 people at USSS location to include (at a minimum):  Analysis & design; Installation; Security; Orientation; Support; End user training.  Support for 1-year from date of installation to include (at a minimum): Via Telephone (business hours); 4 hr response time; 24/7 helpdesk & email support; 24/7 patches & features download; S/W upgrades.
