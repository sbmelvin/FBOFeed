<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The Energy Research Group of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in collaboration with the Technical Directorate of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a municipal waste stream of degradable organic waste within a high solids inflow to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited in a landfill from an Air Force installation.
<p>The Air Force is interested in demonstrating how biogas from anaerobic digestion of organic waste can be used to offset bioreactor operating expenses or enhance aerobic decomposition of waste for the following purposes: 1) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 2) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost); and 3) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills. A crucial element of the research and development approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Influent municipal waste solids would include glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic constituents. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Anticipated total program funding is $5.832M with multiple awards possible.</p>

<DESC>The US Army, Army Contracting Command Joint Munitions and Lethality Contracting Center, Soldier Weapons Center (CCJM-SW) on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Soldier Weapons (PM-SW) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Trintek, Inc. 100 Valley Road, Suite 101, Mount Arlington, NJ 07856.
The Office of the Project Manager, Soldier Weapons (PM-SW) is designated with the responsibility and authority for life cycle systems management for Army Weapons programs. The mission is to accomplish program objectives for development, production and sustainment based on defined soldier needs. PM SW plans to award a small purchase order to Trintek Inc in order to allow for the continuation of the support service until the contractor is in sourced. This will allow for the continued support of preparing, reviewing or updating all program documents as required for Milestone Decisions to support Life Cycle system milestone decisions, cost reporting requirements and to produce milestone packages. The contractor also provides program management engineering and logistical support for programs in production and works with production facilities and Government operations.
A competitive award for this service would result in a required period of learning that would likely take longer than the current extension being obtained through a sole source small purchase order. 
This notice is not a solicitation and does not obligate the government to issue a Solicitation, nor will the government be liable for any costs involved for submission of information in response to this notice.
Point of Contact for this action is Jon Glassic, Contract Specialist, CCJM-SW, (973)724-3142, Jon.Glassic@us.army.mil

This opportunity is available only to the contractors under the existing Multiple Award Task Order Contract established by the Forest Service.  The basic Multiple Award Task order Contract was competed and awarded for Road Maintenance contracts within the Coronado National Forest in Arizona.

This task order is for the installation of engineered grade-controlling permanent weirs in creeks located in the Coronado National Forest.  Use of interlocking sheet steel piling segments of pre-cut length is planned.  These weirs will require excavation of a trench deep enough to seat the majority of the sheet piling length, both to prevent scour from exposing more than half the pile length and also to limit the exposed drop-off that the weir presents adjacent to the road.  It is expected these weirs will be installed at approximately eleven locations throughout the forest.

One fixed-price award in the form of a Task Order is expected to result from this solicitation.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain crew carrier buses as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation within 15 days of the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vipr.php.In addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:  1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php. 2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<CONTACT>Malinda L Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email holdcram@exchange.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source basis; Library construction kits (Fragment, Mate Paired, and Long Mate Paired);   Templated beads preparation (ePCR) kits; SOLiD™ sequencing kits - kits include SOLiD™ Mate-Paired Library Sequencing Kit – Master Mix 35,  SOLiD™ Mate-Paired Library Sequencing Kit – Master Mix 50, and SOLiD™ Fragment Library Sequencing Kit – Master Mix 50; and Software and hardware upgrades for the government owned Applied Biosystems SOLiD™ 3 System from Applied Biosystems, part of Life Technology Corporation; 850 Lincoln Centre Drive; Foster City, California 94404. 

The supplies and services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 12, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR Part 13.5.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The purpose of this acquisition is to pursue the comprehensive whole genome sequencing of cancer specimens, including those from rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) patients with paired germ line DNA.  In addition, the products will also be used to perform next generation sequencing of the RMS and other cancer transcriptomes.

The reagents and consumables associated with this acquisition are not generic, and as such, Applied Biosystems, part of Life Technology Corporation, is the only known manufacturer for the essential reagents and consumables for sequencing on the AB SOLiD™ instrument.  Only these reagents and consumables operate in the SOLiD instrument as Applied Biosystems holds patent rights and exclusive licenses specific to each product category.  
The NCI also requires the uniqueness of the SOLiD Whole Transcritpome Kit for strand specific determinations.  High throughput sequencing has revealed that transcripts are also synthesized from the anti-sense strand of DNA.  Furthermore, other types of non-coding RNA (e.g., miRNA) have been shown to represent a significant fraction of the genome and to be transcribed from both strands of DNA.  For this reason, it is important to know to which strand of the DNA each RNA transcript maps.  Because the kit is not limited to poly (A+) RNA, a more thorough investigation of the complexity of the transcriptome can be performed.  The kit uses Applied Biosystems’ proprietary Ligase Enhanced Genome Detection (LEGenD™) technology to convert RNA into a library of double-stranded DNA molecules.  Because the adapters are added simultaneously and in a directional manner, genomic DNA strand specificity is maintained.  
Applied Biosystems is the only source known to NCI that can provide the aforementioned proprietary reagents and supplies needed to continue the mission of the NCI CCR.   In addition, this is the only known patented technology available to run on the AB SOLiD™ system, coupled with the highest tag count available.

Period of Performance shall be from award through 12 months, with one, 12 month option period.  In addition, this is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract.  Only one (1) award will be made as a result of this notice.

This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above supplies, it may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein. Capability statements must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisition by 11:00 AM ET on December 07, 2009. No electronic capability statements will be received via electronic mail or fax.  If you have questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or fax - 301 402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

In order to receive an award, contractors must have current registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) http://orca.bpn.gov.  Please reference NCI-100020-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.  A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute for the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Olympus America Inc., 3500 Corporate Pkwy., Center Valley, PA 18034 for the Olympus IX81 for selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM).  Selective plane illumination microscopy is a relatively new technique that requires multiple objectives to fit in a tight space above the sample.  The mechanical assemblies have already been machined which fit the objectives in the space above the Olympus stage holder.  Additionally, the 3rd objective in the setup is an Olympus objective designed to be mounted conventionally in an inverted Olympus microscope.  The Olympus IX81 will also be used for TIRF and laser applications and another microscope would need to be customized for these uses.  The cost to duplicate specialized lenses, lamp-housings, stages and laser inputs would exceed $50,000 for the laboratory; not including the cost incurred in time spent re-optimizing these items for a different microscope.  Laser input is critical and the Olympus not only inputs laser light through the TIRF illuminator but has a separate optical path independent of the reflected fluorescent/TIRF light path.  This allows for widefield fluorescence while simultaneously inputting lasers without the use of 50%/50% type beamsplitters.  This maximizes both laser input and the fluorescence signal for both.  The use of a laser port fluorescence turret allows an additional laser input and access to the ability to remove the tube lens to control the beam characteristics.  The potential addition of another laser input light path on the left side of the microscope is a useful upgrade to this microscope.  The microscope is easily upgradable with the addition of the Olympus ZDC (Zero Drift Compensation) to maintain focus during long time lapse experiments.  The correction of aberrations is done in the objective rather then through the eyepiece or a tube lens, as in other microscope manufacturers.  This is an essential feature, as it minimizes optical aberrations that may occur when trying to input or output various components between the objective and the tube lens or eyepieces.  Olympus is currently the only microscope company to manufacture the highest NA objective for light microscopy – the 1.65 NA oil immersion objective.  This objective allows for the highest resolution images, and is incompatible with other microscope companies. This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 333314 and the Size Standard is 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-EB-2010-25-JKS may be submitted by mail to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6136A, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902, Attention: Jennifer Schlegel, by fax transmission to (301) 480-3432 or by email to schlegeljk@nhlbi.nih.gov

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with L-3 Communications - Electron Devices Division, 960 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA, 94070-4194.  The FFP contract will cover a 21-month period for an effort to modernize AN/ALQ 99 (V) Tactical Jamming System's Band 5/6 Transmitter Output Traveling Wave Tube (OTWT).  The current OTWT is a 1960's design, is difficult to manufacture and has a low production yield rate.  The program objective is to implement changes in design and fabrication to increase the yield to at least 75% and reduce the time for processing and test using modern design tools and techniques.  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed drawings/specifications, test procedures and test stations in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.

<DESC>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) intends to award a sole source contract to Dr. Bahattin Buyuksahin; 2111 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202. The period of performance will be for a base year starting January 1, 2010 and will include two one-year option periods. The contractor will provide advanced econometric analyses of CFTC's current database and assist in the development of electronic systems based on rigorous econometric modeling that can associate related contracts to detect and test for trading patterns that demonstration the potential for adverse market impacts. Dr. Buyuksahin has extensive experience with SAS statistical programming. Dr. Buyuksahin has a high level of expertise in high frequency data analysis and time series econometrics and direct experience in developing numerous statistical analyses which have been utilized in Congressional testimony. His areas of expertise include Granger causality tests, maximum entropy techniques, vector error correction models, vector autoregressions, panel data analysis, GARCH and ARCH volatility modeling, and "min span" analysis. Pending legislation, if passed, will move many of the oversight functions currently delegated to Exchanges and Clearinghouses to the CFTC. Accordingly, the CFTC requires an expert econometrician with vast experience in econometric analyses techniques in order to implement the new oversight responsibilities in a responsible and efficient manner. This notice is not a request for offers and no solicitation is available. Interested parties must submit their capability statements in writing within 15 days of the date this notice is posted.

Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>UKRAINE: DONETSK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IMRPOVEMENT AND EXPANSION PROJECT FEASIBILITY STUDY The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to:</p>
<p><br />1.determine the requirements for expanding/improving the airport facilities at Donetsk International Airport; <br />2.determine the viability of the latest design for a new terminal complex that the Grantee is proposing and propose two alternate schematic plans; <br />3.assess the financial feasibility of the three plans; and,<br />4.determine a financing strategy based on the use of multinational bank funds and local and private funding.</p>
<p>Donetsk Airport is the fourth largest airport in Ukraine.  Donetsk Airport serves Donetsk Oblast and areas of heavily populated surrounding oblasts, so the total population of the area served by the airport is approximately six million.  Donetsk Airport is the main hub of the fast-growing Ukrainian air carrier Donbassaero, and the airport also is served by other European airlines, such as Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines.  The airport is owned by the Donetsk Oblast Council, which is responsible for development and upkeep of the terminal and associated facilities. The current Soviet-era passenger terminal building was built in the 1970s and does not meet current standards for international passenger facilities. Furthermore, Donetsk Airport has experienced rapid traffic growth over the last five years, with passenger traffic growing at a rate of 18% per year and aircraft movements increasing at a rate of more than 5% per year.  Although airport officials report that the existing terminal is unable to effectively handle current traffic, recent projections estimate that the number of annual passengers at Donetsk Airport will increase from 650,000 in 2008 to more than one million by 2017.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $520,209 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp. Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Any such request must be received no later than 4:00 PM, DECEMBER 18, 2009 in order to be honored.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR<br />PROGRAM MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING, AND ACQUISITION SUPPORT (PMEAS)
<p>A. INTRODUCTION <br />1. This is a Sources Sought synopsis being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time.<br />2. This is an initial step in the planning process for the Program Management, Engineering and Acquisition Support follow-on acquisition currently titled PMEAS.<br />3. The 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of program, functional and resource management as well as engineering services to support the entire acquisition cycle of Information Technology (IT) systems and other USSTRATCOM and Joint Force Component Command mission programs. This support will supplement government organic resources within United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), select Joint Force Component Commands, Electronic Systems Center, and other associated supporting organizations. Program Management support contractors shall not provide personal services, nor perform inherently government functions.<br />4. The solicitation, when issued, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP) and a Performance Price Tradeoff source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection. <br />5. The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) is 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services, which has a small business size standard of $7.0M in annual gross income.<br /><br />B. BACKGROUND<br />1. In November 2007, a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) GSA Task Order was competitively awarded to provide PMAS support to USSTRATCOM and its associated units for a base period of one year and a one year option period. PMAS support consists of technical and program management support services in support of the acquisition of Information Technology (IT) systems for USSTRATCOM and select Joint Force Component Commands. Estimated contract value is $50M.<br />2. The contract required the winning contractor to sign a Conflict-of-Interest (COI) statement which precluded the winning contractor from performing on future contracts supporting USSTRATCOM with the exception of the PMEAS follow-on contract. This was necessary because the winning contractor, in performance of the PMEAS contract, would have access to Government proprietary information providing them an unfair competitive advantage to bidding on future contracts. The contractor was also required to have each employee working on the contract sign a Non-Disclosure statement.<br /><br />C. PMEAS REQUIREMENTS<br />1. Objective: The Contractor shall provide a wide range of diverse services including: program, acquisition logistics, engineering, and financial management tasks required to support and sustain various USSTRATCOM areas.<br />2. Tasks: Performance Work Statement (PWS) tasks my include, but are not limited to, capabilities integration and planning, cost estimating, schedule analysis, earned value management, engineering, configuration/data management, administrative support, acquisition management, logistics management, test and evaluation, government furnished property (GFP) management, participation on Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) and related activities, analyzing problems, defining alternative solutions, providing recommendations, writing reports, and accomplishing specifically assigned work as defined in individual task orders. There is a possibility that systems engineering tasks may be included as well.<br />3. Special Requirements: Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) requirements apply and the contractor awarded the PMEAS contract must be aware of OCI limitations due to the sensitive nature of the data they will have access to during their performance of PMEAS.<br />4. Period of Performance: It is anticipated that the contract period will be a base period of one year (01 Oct 2010 thru 30 Sep 2011) and four one-year option periods, exercised at the unilateral right of the Government. Contract transition is expected to be 30-60 days starting approximately between 01 Aug 2010 and 01 Sep 2010.<br />5. Place of Performance and Workdays: The primary place of performance will be at USSTRATCOM, Offutt AFB NE. However, performance may be required at other DOD facilities or contractor sites as necessary. Normal workdays are Monday through Friday except US Federal Holidays. However, short term surge situations may require in excess of 8 hours on occasion. Contractors must ensure that they can provide for this type of contingency. All overtime hours must be approved by the government designated Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) prior to any excess hours worked.<br />6. Contract Type and Ceiling: The contract type has not yet been determined, but the Government is contemplating a single award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) requirements IAW Air force Instruction (AFI) 63-124 dated 10 Aug 05 or later apply. The estimated ceiling for this effort is $50M.<br />7. Security: SECRET security clearances will be required for all employees prior to performing any tasks in the PWS. Several individuals may require access at a higher level to include Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Final security requirements will be documented in the DD Form 254.<br />8. Travel: Travel to other government facilities or other contractor facilities may be required. All travel requirements, (including plans, agenda, itinerary, dates, etc.) must be approved by the government designated Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) prior to actual travel. The Government shall reimburse the contractor for travel expenses incurred in direct support of this contract. Travel and per diem will be paid IAW Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 31.205-46 and the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR).<br /><br />D. INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS:<br />1.

<DESC>Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command, AFRISS-TF Program Management Office is seeking information from industry regarding approaches and related risks associated with migrating an existing data base system (Air Force Recruiting Information Support System) employed by Active Duty Air Force Recruiting Services and by the Air National Guard, into another existing data base system (Air Force Recruiting Information Support System-Reserve) employed by Air Force Reserve Recruiting Services. Both systems apply an Oracle 10g database. Once combined into one system (AFRISS-R being the baseline), the new system will be known as Air Force Recruiting Information Support System-Total Force (AFRISS-TF). The intent of this RFI is to provide the AFRISS-TF Program Management Office with market research and insight to help assess the capability of available technologies, and the long-term visibility of potential approaches and solutions to integrate the two systems indicated above into the AFRISS-R baseline with subsequent limited sustainment of the new system. The solution must support a secure system, applying Business Rule Information Management (BRIM) to create, amend and adjudicate information on applicants seeking entry into the Air Component. In addition, the new system must be able to produce a myriad of reports, and provide and receive data to and from other external agencies.
<p>This RFI should not be construed as a commitment by the Air Force, Air National Guard, or the Air Force Reserve to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract. Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to the RFI. This RFI is in no way binding to the government. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this request. The information will be used to facilitate acquisition planning; any proprietary information will be handled accordingly. The determination of an acquisition strategy, based upon comments submitted by interested parties in response to this RFI is solely within the discretion of the government. The NAICS Code 541512, Computer System Design Services, is subject to change based on market research and input from industry to the Program Office.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  Rapid Ecoregional Assessment Support Services  Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Contracts
Classification Code:  F  National Resources & Conservation 
NAICS Code:  541620  Environmental Consulting Services
The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to identify sources capable of performing rapid ecoregional assessment services on land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  This is not a request for proposals.
The Department of the Interior, BLM, Division of Resource Services, intends to contract for services to conduct rapid ecoregional assessments on a significant portion of the Western United States and Alaska over the next several years.  The BLM intends to award multiple IDIQ contracts these assessments services.  Individual assessments will be contracted for as task orders and competed with the firms who have basic IDIQ contracts with the BLM for these services.  Each assessment will be completed in less than 18 months.  Each assessment will be firm-fixed-price.  
At a minimum, these assessments issued as task orders will provide information and analysis necessary to determine the status of three categories of conservation values [1) native species, 2) terrestrial ecosystems, and 3) aquatic ecosystems] and the affect of four change agents [1) climate change, 2) wildland fire, 3) invasive species, and 4) development in the form of renewable energy, conventional energy, and urbanization] upon these conservation values.  These assessments will inform the BLMs landscape-scale conservation, restoration, adaptation, development, and mitigation strategies.  These assessments will also provide a venue to facilitate cross-jurisdictional collaboration and partnerships.
Rapid ecoregional services to be acquired by the issuance of competitive task orders under the multiple IDIQ contracts will include such items as 1) assessment of resource status, and quantification of risk from current and potential exposure to change agents; 2) collection and compilation of existing data; 3) geospatial analysis, modeling, and data management; 4) report preparation and meeting facilitation; and 5) stakeholder and cooperator engagement.
Some task orders may be supported using funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA or stimulus funds).  The IDIQ contracts will include the required ARRA clauses.
The period of performance effort for the IDIQ contracts is one year with four option years from the data of contract award.  It is estimated that each IDIQ contract will have a minimum total order amount of $5,000 and a maximum total order amount of $10 Million.
The NAICS code is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of $7 million.
It is essential that any prospective awardees be responsible and responsive in performing these services.  Interested sources that think they possess the capabilities to perform these support services should submit electronically a Statement of Capability of not more than five pages to the point of contact detailed below.  Any proprietary information should be identified and marked.
This Statement of Capability shall include:1) the firms name and address, DUNS number, business size, and the names to two principals who may be contacted with title, phone number, and email address,2) ability of the firm to meet the described requirements,3) experience of the firm in providing similar services, 4) management capabilities of the firm, 5) similar Government contracts under which the firm performed, 6) other similar contracts under which the firm performed, 7) professionals on-staff with or retained by the firm with a statement of each persons with relevant qualifications, education, and experience, and 8) any other information pertinent to supporting the firms ability to perform the described services.   
This statement is for market research purposes only and should be not viewed as a proposal.
Statements of Capability may be sent electronically to Cheryl Flanagan, Contracting Officer, at Cheryl_Flanagan@blm.gov on or before December 1, 2009 at 5 p.m. mountain time.  Submissions in any other manner or that exceed five pages will not be honored.

<DESC>The NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is performing a technical assessment toform the basis of a possible proposal for the NASA Science Mission Directorate DiscoveryProgram opportunity. This assessment is focused on conducting scientific exploration ofthe planet Mars using ARES, a robotic aerial platform (ARES: Aerial Regional-scaleEnvironmental Surveyor).The purpose of this announcement is to enable LaRC to obtain potential providers toparticipate in the development of the technical concept, proposal, and mission elementimplementation of several mission areas in response to the upcoming NASA DiscoveryProgram Announcement of Opportunity (AO).  Specific mission areas where LaRC is seekingassistance include:(1)	The ARES Science Team.(2)	ARES Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) Team(3)	Design and development of the aerial platform structures and mechanisms subsystemincluding the composite airframe, associated hinging and latching mechanisms, and controlsurfaces. (4)	Design and development of the liquid rocket propulsion subsystem for the aerialplatform. (5)	Design and development of the command and data handling, flight software, and thenavigation sensors (only for entry and flight over Mars). (6)	Design and development of the telecommunications subsystem for the aerialplatform and entry system.(7)	Design and development of two complete cameras.Discovery Program investigations address NASAs planetary science goals as described inSolar System Exploration, NASAs 2006 roadmap for planetary science. The roadmap may befound at http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy/  . While Discoveryinvestigations may focus on any body in the Solar System, excluding the Earth and theSun, and including Mars and the Moon, the ARES synopsis focuses on the exploration ofMars. Discovery investigations will be led by a Principal Investigator and will be comprised ofscientists in partnerships, potentially involving NASA Centers, academia, and industry.These teams will pursue missions of high scientific value utilizing observation platformsof their choice and design.Release of a draft Discovery AO is expected by the end of CY 2009.  It is anticipatedthat approximately two to three Discovery investigations will be selected for 9-monthPhase A concept studies. At the conclusion of these concept studies, it is planned thatone Discovery investigation will be selected to continue into Phase B and subsequentmission phases.  A launch date of 2016 is planned.Key attributes of the baseline concept for each area are noted below. These attributesare provided as a guide, however, the final system design submitted for the Discoveryproposal will be developed between the selected Offeror(s) and LaRC. All responsesprovided should have demonstrated space heritage. While each of the subsystems may becomprised of multiple elements, it is the intention of the Government to solicit entitiesto provide complete subsystems for eventual integration into the mission in lieu ofprocuring specific components via this announcement. Key attributes of the ARES Science Team are scientists with past experience andpublications and understanding of Mars atmospheric chemistry, the structure and dynamicsof the planetary boundary layer, Mars geology and geochemistry, including crustalmagnetism and sub-surface water and the evolution of Mars. Key attributes for Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) providers include activities thatextend the knowledge learned through the ARES Discovery mission and engage students andthe general public through various forms of media, including social networking, formaland informal education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Morespecifically, LaRC is looking for E/PO providers that have previous experience ineducating the public on previous NASA science missions, are willing to cost share, andhave a clear approach to marketing the program activities and achievements to a regionaland national audience.Key attributes of the aerial platform structures and mechanisms subsystem include a highstrength composite airframe structural material system suitable for use in spacestructures. Structures and mechanisms include compound curvature elements and the abilityto fold the wings and tail of the airframe allowing for rapid deployment in theatmosphere of Mars. Key attributes of the liquid rocket propulsion subsystem for the aerial platform consistof a hypergolic bi-propellant propulsion subsystem. The preferred bi-propellantcombination is monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen tetroxide (MON-3).   Thepropulsion subsystem includes all necessary storage elements, pressurant, propellantmanagement and control elements, and the thrusters. The baseline total thrust rangenecessary is 50-95 Newtons. Key attributes of the command and data handling, flight software, and navigation sensorsinclude high reliability integrated space electronics for commanding and data storage.Navigation sensors include inertial measurement unit(s) and radar. Software includesflight software as well as all associated ground support and testing software.Key attributes of the telecommunications subsystem for the aerial platform include a UHFtelecommunications subsystems with simultaneous transmit and receive capability suitablefor space flight systems. Key elements include a UHF transceiver, and multipleomni-directional low gain conformal antennas. Key attributes for the camera provider will include past experience in planetary imagingsystems, demonstrated space heritage and the ability for still and video operation of thecameras.Offers will be reviewed, evaluated, and selected at NASA LaRC.	If selected through thissynopsis, each provider is expected to participate in the technical assessment, proposaldevelopment, and on the mission implementation team. LaRC will require each selectedprovider to submit a detailed letter of commitment outlining their contribution, whichwill be included in the proposal.LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the Offerors provided the ARESmission concept is selected for implementation. Interested parties may propose as aprovider for any, all, or any combination of the areas sought. Provider selections willbe made by LaRC based on the listed criteria in the following order of importance:(1)	Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the Offerorsrelevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities.Provide a description of relevant technical experience including a summary of significantachievements and technical performance.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA’s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  
Scope:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (USDOT/NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) conducts research and evaluation projects dealing with behaviors and attitudes in highway safety issues. Program focus is on drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and motorcyclists. 
The OBSR is interested in conducting a study examining the effects of high visibility community campaigns enforcing the drinking and driving laws on community members’ perceived risk of alcohol-impaired drivers being stopped and arrested.  In particular, the OBSR is interested in assessing the impact on perceived risk of two different types of high visibility enforcement (HVE) programs:  (1) a program in which highly visible forms of enforcement and media outreach are fully integrated into normal law enforcement agency operations and sustained over an extended period of time; and (2) a program that compacts the high visibility enforcement and accompanying media outreach into intervention activity occurring five-to-six times a year.  Both are models designed to overcome previously identified weaknesses of more limited enforcement wave approaches in influencing risk perception.  The primary objective of this study would be to assess any changes associated with the HVE programs in community members’ perceived risk of alcohol-impaired drivers being stopped and arrested.  This would include exploring whether there is a differential impact on perceptions both in terms of the type of HVE program as well as risk characteristics of drivers.  The experimental design would include a comparison site not exposed to either of the two program models but instead engages in current common practice (i.e., a limited wave approach focused on the two times of the year when the National Alcohol Impaired Driving Crackdowns are occurring).  Besides collecting self-report awareness and attitudinal data from the intervention and comparison sites, the study would collect on-road BAC data to assess program impact on behavior.   

NHTSA would like to answer the following questions:

1.	Was there a measurable change within intervention communities in the perceived likelihood that an alcohol-impaired driver would be stopped and arrested?
2.	What was the level of awareness within intervention communities that the enforcement activity was occurring and did it grow over time? 
3.	How did drivers deemed most at risk of driving at illegal BACs compare to other drivers in their perceptions of risk and their awareness of enforcement activity?
4.	Were the intervention communities able to obtain continuing media coverage of their enforcement activities? 
5.	How well did high visibility enforcement and media outreach integrate into the normal activities of the law enforcement agencies?
6.	Did the enforcement programs correspond with a change in measured BACs on the road? 

Capability

The corporate capability statement is expected to address the capabilities required to support the scope section above, along with the characteristics identified below.

Experience and expertise in working with law enforcement agencies;
Working knowledge of operational procedures, training, and organizational structures commonly employed by law enforcement agencies;
Experience and expertise in collecting telephone survey data, including telephone interviews with persons on cell phones;
Experience and expertise in working with communities to set up community-level programs;
Skills in establishing systems for communicating with program sites, monitoring activity in program sites, and developing data collection plans with program sites;
Capabilities in identifying and separating out from telephone survey data drivers at high risk of driving at illegal BAC levels, as well as capabilities in identifying and utilizing supplemental sources for data collection from high BAC drivers:

<DESC>The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) MILSATCOM Systems Wing (MCSW) intends to issue a contract, FA8088-10-C-0002, to acquire Milstar and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS III) satellite operations and logistics sustainment support. This 5-year contract will provide for satellite-sustaining maintenance engineering in support of satellite health and safety, and system and mission operations. This is a continuation of effort to the existing Milstar and DSCS Orbital Operations Support (OOS) and MILSATCOM Logistics Sustainment Support (MLSS) contracts currently performed by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, 111 Lockheed Martin Way, Bldg 157, Sunnyvale, CA 94089. <br />
<p><br />MCSW intends to award&nbsp;a contract on a sole source basis under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2). Award to another contractor will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. Based on an evaluation of Statements of Capability submitted in response to the sources sought notice issued on 30 Jun 2008 for this effort, MCSW concluded that only the incumbent, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC), possesses both the capability and experience necessary to effectively provide Milstar and DSCS operations and logistics sustainment support. LMSSC was the only contractor with demonstrated Milstar and DSCS III satellite and ground system logistics capability, past program experience, and knowledge to perform the required software, hardware, and system/anomaly analyses; system design, maintenance, integration and test; and individual spacecraft configurations, orbital operations and procedures.</p>
<p>While this notice of intent is for information purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may identify their interest and technical capability, and submit information which shall be considered by the agency. Capabilities information, which shall not exceed 20-pages in length, may be emailed to: tracy.stroud@losangeles.af.mil. Responses from small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to the Government Points of Contact: Ms. Tracy Stroud (email: tracy.stroud@losangeles.af.mil, phone: 310-653-4894) or Mr. Darwin Kibby (email: darwin.kibby@losangeles.af.mil, phone at 310-653-9528)</p>

<DESC>Under the authority of 6.302-1, the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to Protonex Technology Corporation, of Southborough, MA, as the only manufacturer and reseller of the BPM602 BAO Power Manager.  They are also the only manufacturer and reseller of the cables that support the BPM602 BAO Power Manager.  This developmental item is unavailable from any other source.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.<BR><BR>Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs: <BR>The Future Warrior Technology Integration team (FWTI) needs a small, soldier wearable power manager to distribute and regulate power across the soldier system as well as log data on energy consumption through bi-directional communication with other system components.  The power manager must be ruggedized for military use per MIL-STD-810F.  The FWTI soldier system components that will transmit data to the power manager are leveraged from the USAF Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) arena, so the power manager will have to be compatible with those areas.<BR>A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.):<BR>Protonex is the only manufacturer and retailer of the BPM602 BAO Power Manager for the Air Force's Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit.  As a result, they are the only company who can tailor their system software to be compatible with the requirements of our soldier system.  Protonex also has a unique position in the marketplace because they are high tech integrators of man-portable power systems from batteries, to fuel cells, to power management.  The only other company in the market place that can manufacture this type of power manager is Smart Fuel Cell Gmb (SFC) of Germany.  They are currently under contract with FWTI and their power manager is currently being used with the FWTI systems being tested.  <BR>A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR>The Untied States Air Force conducted extensive research in the area of man-wearable power management systems when it developed its Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Kit.  Two main contractors were selected for prototype fabrication - Smart Fuel Cell Gmb (SFC) of Germany and Protonex of Southborough, MA.  Also the US Army Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) at Ft. Monmouth, NJ has done extensive market research and has recently awarded Protonex a contract for development of a next generation man-wearable power manager.  Both The USAF BAO Kit project and CERDEC project have provided extensive market research in this area, and we are leveraging this research in selecting Protonex for this purchase.<BR>5)   Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR>Protonex is a locally based technology development firm.  This close proximity, Southborough, MA, will be highly beneficial for rapid trouble shooting and technical changes required on developmental programs like this.  <BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at david.barceleau@us.army.mil no later than 23 November 2009, 14:00 pm EDT.  <BR>

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(a)2(b), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to University of Michigan Dearborn of Dearborn, MI, to develop a laser assisted cold spray nozzle which provides a critical functionality to the manufacturing platform for depositing bio-compatible composite coatings onto their custom implants.  The proposed contract includes design and development which will have the ability to (a) design develop and demonstrate the laser assisted cold spray nozzle concept, (b) demonstrate coatings with low plastic strain and determine the in-vitro response and (c) demonstrate coatings with higher HAP content without broken particles.<BR><BR>Within their ongoing program On Demand Custom Body Implant and Prosthesis (W911QY-09-C-0011), the contractor demonstrated that hydroxyapatite (HAP) and titanium biocompatible composite coatings could be cold sprayed without compromising their desirable phase constituents of HAP.  However, when the HAP content was increased above 50%, voids as well as broken particles were observed in these coatings.  Furthermore, the in-vitro studies in simulated body fluids showed higher corrosion response with cold sprayed composite coatings due to the presence of significant plastic strain.  In order to reduce the plastic strain during deposition as well as enable higher HAP content without cracked particles in these coatings, they propose to develop a cold spray nozzle that couples a laser beam coaxially to the nozzle.  This would eliminate any post treatment required for enhanced bio-compatibility.<BR><BR>Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, via e-mail at jonathan.lehmann@us.army.mil. no later than 2 December 2009, 12:00 pm EST.

<CONTACT>Michael S Scheuchenzuber, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 605-6116, Email mscheuchenzuber@ntis.gov
<DESC><br />Notice Type: Notice of Intent to Sole Source to Hewlett Packard<br /><br />The National Technical Information Service (NTIS) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Hewlett Packard&nbsp;for a service and maintenance contract. (we are hoping to use the Hewlett Packard GSA contract)<br />The period of performance will be January 1, 2010 thru December 31, 2010.<br />NTIS intends to enter into a sole source contract, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 c (1) only one responsible source, with Hewlett Packard Company, Bethesda, Maryland to perform hardware and software maintenace on Hewlett Packard equipment.&nbsp; The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.&nbsp; This acquisition is being conducted under simplifed acquistion procedures (FAR 13).&nbsp; The NAICS for this requirement is 541511 and the FSC is 70.<br /><br />Our rationale for the sole source procurement is listed below:<br /><br />
<p>NTIS currently uses Hewlett-Packard (HP) workstations and servers in its IT Data Center. Request NTIS continues to use HP Engineers <br />for the following reasons: <br /><br />- Third Party Maintainers (TPMs) cannot access, use or distribute SW in the contractual area legally without HP service coverage that is linked to the product experiencing the issue. This could put our environment at risk of additional downtime due to product failures. <br /><br />- TPMs can only support hardware; they may have problems diagnosing and resolving issues that involve multiple technology areas (e.g., Operating System software, networking).<br /><br />- TPMs do not have access to all the proprietary tools available to HP technicians and authorized resellers. These are the tools that can help reduce downtime and ensure expert repairs through quick identification of failures.<br /><br />- TPMs will not have the on-going training and information that HP engineers have. They would not know when new electronic tools are released and would not have the connection into HP specialist resources. <br /><br />- Some of NTIS' servers are HP9000 models. TPMs are not authorized by HP to support HP9000 and Integrity Servers, or high-end HP storage products. This means that HP is not &lsquo;standing behind' any support they may deliver to these products. <br /><br />Maintaining exclusive use of HP Engineers preserves NTIS' investment in hardware, software, and peripherals. HP has developed unique and powerful tools to diagnose and fix problems quickly and completely, including:<br /><br />&bull; Proprietary Diagnostics and tools<br />&bull; Extensive knowledge databases<br />&bull; HP Service Essentials, an industry-leading remote support solution that provides proactive monitoring, remote hardware event management and remote network access.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.&nbsp; However, interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.&nbsp; Responses received by December&nbsp;4, 2009 will be considered by the Government.&nbsp; A determination not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a non competitive procurement.&nbsp; Written responses to this synopsis are required to contain sufficent documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement within the discretion of the Government.<br />Information can be mailed to the Contracting Officer at <a href="mailto:Mscheuchenzuber@ntis.gov">Mscheuchenzuber@ntis.gov</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS - This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.
The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit interests and information from sources pertaining to the performance of long term stress relaxation testing of elastomeric samples.  The samples to be tested consist of two sizes: "tall" samples are .56" x .14" x .373" high and "short" samples are .56" x .14" x .235" high.  The samples will be cut to size and initially inspected by NSWC Crane prior to shipment to the contractor.  Once received, samples shall be visually inspected by the contractor for damage and to determine suitability for testing.  Contractor shall provide a means to uniquely identify each sample without direct marking.  A dimensional inspection of the samples shall be made in accordance with ASTM D 3767 or equivalent and provided in subsequent reports.  Three samples of each size will be tested for a total of six samples.  One additional sample will be made available for developmental purposes.  
Samples shall be placed in test fixtures, one per fixture, at ambient conditions (2510C and 20-80% relative humidity).  The fixture shall compress the sample to a predetermined height (+/- .002") and then be "locked" into position.  Compression of the samples shall be accomplished in a manner that maintains parallelism between the surfaces within .002".  Dimensional inspection shall be utilized to verify the final compressed height and the parallelism requirement.  
Four hours (minimum) after compression, the samples shall be subjected to 74 ? 2C for 1.5-hours (ramp rate of +/-2C per minute) and then returned to ambient conditions.  After a thirty hour (minimum) wait period, the samples shall be subjected to 85C ? 2C for twenty-four hours (ramp rate of +/-2C per minute) and then returned to ambient conditions.  Once the samples return to ambient conditions, they shall undergo ten thermal cycles from -10C ? 3C to 85C ? 3C (at a ramp rate of +/-10C per minute).
During the stress relaxation test, force measurements and temperature and humidity readings of the test chamber shall be recorded at one hour intervals during ambient conditions and ten minute intervals during thermal conditioning (faster frequency allowable).  The initial measurements and readings shall occur approximately sixty seconds after the desired compression height has been achieved.  After completion of the thermal conditioning profiles, the samples and fixtures shall remain in an ambient lab environment.  Measurements and readings shall continue to be recorded every hour for the next twenty-four hours at which time the frequency may be reduced to once per day until only a percentage of force remains (50% of the initial force) or a six month test period elapses.  
The contractor shall prepare and provide reports to NSWC Crane which document test setup, calibration, anomalies, force, and stress relaxation data.  The raw data captured from this test shall also be provided to NSWC Crane in electronic format.  Based on the start date of the test, reporting shall occur at one week, one month, and upon test completion.  Within fourteen days after test completion, the final report shall be submitted and samples shall be returned to NSWC Crane.  Samples shall be individually bagged and tagged so that their unique identification is maintained.
Contractors should respond to this RFI in writing and should provide their responses both in electronic and hardcopy form.  Limit response to a maximum of 100 pages.  One electronic copy of the response shall be provided in PDF format and must be received by the specified due date.  Contractors shall also submit five hardcopies to the Government.  The hardcopies must be typewritten on single-sided 8.5" by 11" paper with one-inch margins on all sides and double-spaced text, and bound in standard binders.  Use 12-point font with normal (uncondensed) spacing.
At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NOI10021 Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-37 dated&nbsp;October 14,&nbsp;2009. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a standard is 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure two spectrophotometers from Molecular Devices, Inc. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) Item# M5, SpectraMax M5 Microplate/Cuvette Spectrophotometer, qty-2 (including a trade-in of a SpectraMax M2 Platereader, Serial #D02016, manufactured by Molecular Devices), 2) Item# 0200-6117, SpectraTest Absorbance Validation Plate, qty-1, 3) Item# 0200-5060, SpectraTest FL1 Fluorescence Validation Plate, qty-1. This spectrophotometer is proposed as a sole source purchase on the basis that NIH laboratories own an identical system. The spectrophotometer must have the following characteristics: must have a 3 mode (Abs, FI, Lum) cuvette port and 6- to 384- well microplate capabilities for all 5 modes (ABS, FI, TRF, FP, Lum). Must read absorbance, fluorescence, and luminescence in standard, commercially-available cuvettes and microcuvettes, 12 x 75 mm test tubes, and 96- or 384-microplates with a built-in cuvette port and a microplate drawer in the reader and performed with a single wavelength selection. Must use a Xenon flash lamp for longer lamp lifetime. Must have Dual Monochromators for tunable FP wavelength selection between 400 nm and 750 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths. Must have Dual Monochromators for tunable FI, TRF wavelength selection between 250 nm and 850 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths and tunable luminescence between 250 nm and 850 nm. Must have tunable absorbance wavelength selection between 200 nm and 1000 nm. No filters are required for purchase in the future when additional assays are added to laboratory. Must have both top and bottom reading optics for improved sensitivity in cell-based assays such as chemotaxis membrane migration assays. Must have a 4 nm absorbance bandwidth for superior peak resolution and increased accuracy of measurements for narrow bandwidth samples. Must have fixed fluorescence spectral bandwidth of 9 nm excitation and 15 nm emission for improved resolution between EX/EM components. Narrow bandwidth is critical when designing multi-fluorophore assays or when using narrow Stokes shift fluorophores. Must read up to four EX/EM wavelength pairs per microplate for multi-fluorophore assay design. Must have full wavelength scanning capability across the entire spectral range for defining actual EX and EM maxima. Can perform spectral scans in user-definedincrements as small as 1 nm, and then can select assay wavelengths for actual maxima. Increases sensitivity for assay by working at actual conditions rather than using literature references. Must have Automatic PMT setting to adjust the optimum voltage for each well sample concentration and then normalizes the raw data to show RFU values. Wells are selectively reread at the optimal PMT setting. Photo-bleaching is eliminated because wells are not read unnecessarily. Must have dual PMTs: an enhanced, low background PMT for high sensitivity luminescence measurements including luciferase-based reporter gene assays and a separate digital/analog PMT for fluorescence reads. Must incorporate the patented PathCheck sensor (U.S. Patent 5,959,738) - the only sensor of its kind not affected by temperature, and requires no accessories to measure the pathlength of the sample in all individual microplate wells.

<p>1352.201-71 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S TECHNICAL REPRESENTATIVE (COTR) (FEB 2005)<br /><br />a. (To be provided at the time of award) is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR). The COTR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the Contractor by a unilateral modification to the Contract. The COTR is located at: (to be provided at the time of award).<br />b.

<p>NOAA/ERAD METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR<br />SHIP REPAIR (AUGUST 2005)</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule, as follows:</p>
<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>
<p>The invoice must include:</p>
<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>
<p>Department of Commerce/NOAA<br />Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD)<br />Attn: Christine Jeffries<br />200 Granby Street, 8th Floor<br />Norfolk, VA 23510<br />Christine.Jeffries@noaa.gov</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER EA133M-10-SU-XXXX (to be assigned upon contract award). &#61618;</p>
<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for these repairs are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0003). The estimated value of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (SEP 2009) applies, and the following additional FAR clauses cited in the clause at paragraph (b) are applicable to this acquisition:</p>

<p>A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be reduced by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar work items.)</p>
<p>Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.232-25 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>
<p>Name and Address of the contractor;<br />Invoice date<br />Contract Number/Modification No.<br />CLIN/Work Item No., Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price;<br />Shipping and Payment Terms;<br />Name and Address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent;<br />Name, title, phone number, and mailing address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p>

<p>a) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />b) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />c) Ship name; and,<br />d) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.</p>
<p>Note: When invoicing for growth work, the contractor shall identify it as Growth and shall identify the modification number to which authorization was given and the CLIN/work item that the growth is associated.</p>
<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, it is in the contractor's best interest to ensure that the DUNS number is recorded on every invoice submitted against this contract.</p>
<p>All payments based on percentage or stage of completion rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend percentage or stage of completion payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration provided all supporting documentation is submitted and validated.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:</p>

<p>NOAA/ERAD ADDITIONAL ITEM REQUESTS LABOR RATE (MARCH 2005)<br /><br />The Additional Item Requests (AIRs) labor rate (CLIN 0002) offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>a. The rate for all man-hours of labor, to be used for emergent work if ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the "Changes - Ship Repair" or mutually agreed upon by the parties by supplemental agreement to accomplish additional work not required elsewhere in the work items, shall be established using this labor rate. The estimated man-hours for these repairs are listed in Section B. <br /><br />b. This rate shall be a flat rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include:</p>
<p>1 . Production man-hours shall be for skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in <br />direct production as exemplified by the following functions: Abrasive Cleaning/Blasting, Blacksmithing, Boilermaking, Carpentry, Crane Operation, Electrical/Electronics Work, Engineering (Production), Insulating/Lagging, Machining (inside and outside), Painting, Pipe Fitting, Rigging, Sheet-metal Work, Shipfitting, Shipwrights, Staging/Scaffolding, Tank Cleaning, and Welding/Burning/Brazing.<br /><br />2 . Non-production man-hours (whether charged as direct labor or indirect labor by the contractors accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production man-hours. Examples of support functions include: Engineering (support), Estimating, General Labor, Firewatch, Material Handling, Planning, Quality Assurance, Security (General), Supervision, Surveying, Testing, and Transportation.</p>
<p>3 . Other indirect charges including but not limited to the following: overhead, general and administrative, support functions, facilities, and capital cost of money and profit for the contractor and any subcontractors selected by the prime contractor. The hourly rate will not be used to price work which may be directed to a subcontractor by name in the work specifications.</p>
<p>c. All material costs shall be paid based on the contractor's return cost plus the markup identified in Section B (CLIN 0003). The estimated value of additional material for this item is also listed in Section B.</p>
<p>d. The contractor shall take into account full award of estimated AIRs hours during the development of the Production Schedule. Award of any portion of this item does not in its self justify an extension to the original contract completion date.<br /><br />e. The quantities of AIRs labor hours (CLIN 0002) and additional material (CLIN 0003) indicated in Section B are only estimates and are Growth Items pursuant to this solicitation. The provided burdened man-hour rates and material cost rate shall remain in effect for the entire life of the contract. The estimated quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours/material that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule at its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusions of these items do not obligate the Government to exercise the item(s) nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br /><br />HSAR 3052.209-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows]</p>
<p>(a) Prohibitions.</p>
<p>Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p>"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.</p>
<p>(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.</p>
<p>(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.</p>
<p>(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;</p>
<p>(g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Modification 03:  This is a modification to subject solicitation posted in FEDBizOpps on 02 November 2009.  Opening date and time remains unchanged as 20 November 2009; 2:00 PM CST.  This modification is issued to answer questions pertaining to this solicitation and provide general administrative information concerning acknowledgement of amendments.  Questions related to the solicitation follows.<BR><BR>Question 1).  The outside cooling towers are not listed specifically in the scope. You can tell that they are all in need of a PM. What do you want to do about this? T&M after the contract is awarded or an option in the bid? <BR><BR>Question 2).  I checked some of the chemical treatment supply tanks for the towers and they look like they have not been taken care of either. Should these be listed as a separate item? They are also not in the scope.  <BR><BR>Question 3.) In building 3902, the plate to frame heat exchanger is not listed in the scope. Do you want this on the PM also?  The ANSWER to all three (3) questions follow:  The cooling towers, heat exchangers, water treatment and water treatment equipment are not included in this requirement.  The DPW shops are tasked with the preventative maintenance and upkeep on the cooling towers and equipment and water treatment; these tasks are not a part of this requirement.  However, the requirement does require the contractor to list in his reports any abnormal conditions or problems that are observed in the work area or equipment that might affect the chillers or the performance of the chiller maintenance contract.  <BR><BR>NOTE THAT ALL AMENDMENTS MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY BIDDERS; THIS CAN BE DONE BY SIMPLY STATING THAT ALL AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCESSED, READ, AND UNDERSTOOD.  All documents can be downloaded at https://doc.campbell.army.mil.   NAICS is 811310; business size is $7.0M; acquisition is 100% setaside for Service Disabled Veterans Small Business Concerns.  Complete Statement of Work and associated documents can be downloaded at https://doc.campbell.army.mil under subject Solicitation Number.  All responsible concerns may submit a bid that will be considered by this agency.  One award will be made to the bidder who is found to be the lowest priced responsible & responsive bidder who submits the lowest overall price for the base and all option periods.   Facsimile bids ARE NOT acceptable; mailing address is Directorate of Contracting, 13  Street, Building 2174, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, 42223.   All contractors must be registered in the Department of Defense Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to any contract award.

<DESC>COMPLETE BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT ATTACHED Current rotor design practice treats the individual physics disciplines associated with each of the many competing design requirements in a largely uncoupled fashion, an approach that gives rise to lengthy, high cost, iterative development cycles. The goal of the program is to shrink the design cycle from the current timeline (on the order of 8 years) to two years. The very large size (in excess of 20ft in diameter) and geometric complexity of US Navy submarine rotors, their attendant nominal, off-design and casualty load conditions, durability requirements, cost and weight limitations, and [BAA2] are unachievable with existing single-material systems. Tailored multi-material systems offer the opportunity to meet these disparate multidisciplinary goals. To put the goals in context, this program will strive to achieve reductions in the weight of individual rotor blades by 50%, increase in the blade stiffness by a factor of 1.5x, and [BAA3] over the Nickel/Aluminum/Bronze (NAB) baseline. Accordingly, DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals focused on the development and demonstration of revolutionary advancements in multi-material systems and manufacturing processes, enabled by state-of-the-art, physics model coupling and High-Performance Computing (HPC). These transformational technologies are required for the rapid design, development and demonstration of lightweight, high-performance multi-material solutions that can be transitioned to the US Navy for future submarine rotor applications. Key to successful and affordable transition is for the government to have the requisite Intellectual Property (IP) rights that facilitate alternative acquisition strategies. Research proposals shall address one or both of DARPA&rsquo;s Areas of Interest as defined in Tasks 1 and 2 below: &bull; Task 1: Coupling Software Environment Development and Demonstration The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate an innovative multi-physics coupling software environment (CSE) to enable rapid and accurate multidisciplinary performance design and analysis simulations for lightweight, multi-material US Navy submarine rotors. &bull; Task 2: Multi-Material Rotor Manufacturing Design, Process Development, and Demonstration The objective of this effort is to develop and demonstrate innovative material solutions and associated manufacturing and quality control processes for multi-material US Navy submarine rotors that meet Navy-specified weight and multidisciplinary performance goals. All administrative correspondence and non-classified questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred: BAA Administrator Phone: (571) 218-4565 E-mail: DARPA-BAA-09-75@darpa.mil COMPLETE BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT IS ATTACHED

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFQ).   

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 325413, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is posted 100% small business set-aside for all qualified small businesses and will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) has requested the purchase of the following items:

Brand Name or Equal (DSM Premitest B.V.)

001: 1 Kit, Premitest Salmonella Kit (38220000) - The Premi® Test Salmonella is a DNA-based rapid method for the confirmation and serotyping of presumptive Salmonella spp.  Starting from purified, presumptive Salmonella isolates, the Premi® Test Salmonella confirms whether the isolate belongs to the Salmonella genus and based on genetic profiling allocates the Salmonella enterica serotype for the most commonly encountered serovars (i.e. at present 94 serovars taken up in the software database of the Premi® Test Salmonella). The 94 serovars are a subset of the over 2500 Salmonella serovars which are taken up in the Kaufmann-White scheme. The Kaufman-White scheme is a scoring scheme of antigenic formulae which is adopted by the World Health Organization and which requires at least three antibody-antigen reactions (as described in ISO 6579) to identify a particular Salmonella strain to an established serotype name.

The PremiTest is currently undergoing AOAC RI and ISO validation.  FDA can only use validated methods for the analysis of regulatory isolates. 

The following are the specifications for the PremiTest:

1. It is a molecular method (PCR) for the identification of specific Salmonella serotypes.

2. The test can be performed in less than 10 h.


3. It can currently correctly identify 94 different serotypes. Any other serotype, not within the database, is correctly identified as being Salmonella.
4. The database is expandable and will be expanded over time, so we will not be restricted to just 94 serotypes in the future.


002: 16-09999, ATR Reader, 80 (L)x 120 (W) x 155 (H) mm, (1)ea.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued via the US EPA RTP website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10079 and the solicitation is being issued as full and open competition FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541380 and the Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.

EPA has a requirement to analyze up to 750 water, sediment, and biosolid samples for a number of specified sterols using Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) or a modification of the method when approved under Deliverable 1 of this contract.  The Offer shall prepare pricing on a per sample basis, not-to-exceed 750 samples for the entire order.EPA will use thirty-six existing plots (0.75 x 2 m) on USDA-owned land in Oconee County, Georgia to conduct a series of rainfall simulation experiments.  Rainfall simulators, commonly used for nutrient and pathogen transport studies, will be employed to observe fate and transport of sterols associated with animal manure applied to each simulator. 
Simulated rainfall will be applied to the plots at a set rate equivalent to a precipitation return period commonly observed in the Georgia Piedmont, sufficient to produce a surface runoff event.  Runoff will be collected at the hydraulically lower end of each plot.  Baseline simulations will be conducted to determine background sterol levels.  The plot treatments will consist of manure applications from three animal types: swine (liquid manure), beef cattle (solid manure), and poultry (broiler litter), and a control treatment (no manure application).  Each treatment will have three replications and three manure application timings relative to rainfall simulation time.  Manure will be analyzed for sterol loadings previous to application via randomized composite samples. 
The contractor must state in their proposed methodology the anticipated range of efficiency of extraction from liquid and solid phases, concentration factors for liquid phases and anticipated detection limits for each of the listed sterols below.Up to, but not exceeding, 750 samples will be generated for the sterol analysis from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.  Twenty gram sediment and biosolid samples and one liter runoff samples will be collected in the field by EPA staff.  Solids samples will be frozen (-10 degrees Centigrade); and liquids samples will be refrigerated (2-4 degrees Centigrade); and all samples will be delivered to the contractor within 24 hours of collection.  
Filtration of runoff samples and extraction of the filtrate (water phase) must be performed by the contractor within 48 hours of receipt.  The filter retentate can be frozen, stored, and then thawed up to 48 hours prior to extraction.  Sediment and biosolids samples can be thawed up to 48 hours prior to analysis.  All sample extractions should occur within 7 days following receipt of samples.  Analysis of extracts must be completed within 14 calendar days following receipt of the samples.  Results of the analyses for each sample set will be sent to EPA every 21 calendar days after receipt of the initial samples until all analyses are completed.Sample Description, Collection and Delivery Schedule:	
Liquid filtrate samples require immediate processing, while processing of the resulting frozen filtered retentate portion of the samples are not as time sensitive.  Table A enumerates the total number of samples generated during the four sampling events.  - For each of the Sampling Events, samples generated during the day 1, week 1, and week 2 runs will occur over a staggered 2 ? 3 day time frame.  Thus, sample shipments will occur each day for 2-3 days as samples are generated for each of the three runs.  Liquid sample shipments will not exceed a total of 12 filtrate samples for any given day of sampling and shipping.  - Manure and sediment samples will be shipped frozen and will be analyzed within the same time frame as specified for the filter retentate solids. 
EPA will notify the contractor of the anticipated sample ship dates as soon as they are known.Deliverables: 1) The contractor will set up an initial conference call with EPA within three business days of award of this contract to discuss the anticipated start date for this project which is dependent on the outcome of pilot testing of the rainfall simulators currently being carried out by EPA researchers.  The contractor will also at this time discuss, for final details and approval, any other analytical method or any modification to the Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) proposed by the contractor in the contract proposal and accepted by EPA for use in this work. 2) The work in this contract will result in the generation of primary data. Consistent with the Agency?s Quality Assurance (QA) requirements, the contractor must prepare a project-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and analysis plan to assure the quality of the primary data generated.  The QAPP shall specify data quality objectives, best practices and frequency, scope of appropriate QA reports, method performance information, recovery information, matrix spikes, and positive and negative controls clearly included in the sample processing protocol. 3) During each rainfall simulation run, EPA will collect samples for analysis of fecal sterols as outlined in table A of the SOW.  The samples will be shipped out on ice (filtrate at 2-4 degrees centigrade and filter retentate at minus 20 degrees centigrade) for receipt by the contractor to perform sterol within 24 hours of collection.  The fecal sterols to be analyzed are as stipulated in Table B of the SOW. 4) Preliminary data results for sterol analysis shall be provided to EPA no later 21 calendar days after sample receipt.  - Sampling Run: Day 1, Week 1, Week 2 ? Preliminary Report of Results for each sampling run are due 21 calendar days after sample receipt. The contractor shall have a 15 day period for preparation of the Sampling Event Final Report.  This period starts immediately after delivery of the last (?Week 2?) preliminary report.  Sampling Event Final Report ? Due 15 calendar days after completion of last preliminary report. 
Data described immediately above, should be provided electronically in an Excel file, summarizing samples grouped by run for each sampling event. This reporting procedure will be repeated four times --- once for each of the four sampling events.Refer to the Statement of Work for more details regarding this requirement.Evaluation Criteria: The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered. For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the following evaluation criteria:  1) Capacity - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the capacity to process all samples according to the sample holding times and sample delivery as outlined in the SOW.  2) Methodology - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the equipment and capability to implement and conduct the standard method as provided, or demonstrate that they have experience conducting a viable, proven modified method for analysis of the sterols as identified.  3) Past Performance - Previous experience as evidenced by references (should provide 2 ? can be other types of analyses, not just sterol.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will be issued via the US EPA RTP website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The solicitation number is PR-NC-10-10079 and the solicitation is being issued as full and open competition FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-37. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541380 and the Small Business Size Standard is $12 Million.  A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.

EPA has a requirement to analyze up to 750 water, sediment, and biosolid samples for a number of specified sterols using Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) or a modification of the method when approved under Deliverable 1 of this contract.  The Offer shall prepare pricing on a per sample basis, not-to-exceed 750 samples for the entire order.EPA will use thirty-six existing plots (0.75 x 2 m) on USDA-owned land in Oconee County, Georgia to conduct a series of rainfall simulation experiments.  Rainfall simulators, commonly used for nutrient and pathogen transport studies, will be employed to observe fate and transport of sterols associated with animal manure applied to each simulator. 
Simulated rainfall will be applied to the plots at a set rate equivalent to a precipitation return period commonly observed in the Georgia Piedmont, sufficient to produce a surface runoff event.  Runoff will be collected at the hydraulically lower end of each plot.  Baseline simulations will be conducted to determine background sterol levels.  The plot treatments will consist of manure applications from three animal types: swine (liquid manure), beef cattle (solid manure), and poultry (broiler litter), and a control treatment (no manure application).  Each treatment will have three replications and three manure application timings relative to rainfall simulation time.  Manure will be analyzed for sterol loadings previous to application via randomized composite samples. 
The contractor must state in their proposed methodology the anticipated range of efficiency of extraction from liquid and solid phases, concentration factors for liquid phases and anticipated detection limits for each of the listed sterols below.Up to, but not exceeding, 750 samples will be generated for the sterol analysis from December 1, 2009 through November 30, 2010.  Twenty gram sediment and biosolid samples and one liter runoff samples will be collected in the field by EPA staff.  Solids samples will be frozen (-10 degrees Centigrade); and liquids samples will be refrigerated (2-4 degrees Centigrade); and all samples will be delivered to the contractor within 24 hours of collection.  
Filtration of runoff samples and extraction of the filtrate (water phase) must be performed by the contractor within 48 hours of receipt.  The filter retentate can be frozen, stored, and then thawed up to 48 hours prior to extraction.  Sediment and biosolids samples can be thawed up to 48 hours prior to analysis.  All sample extractions should occur within 7 days following receipt of samples.  Analysis of extracts must be completed within 14 calendar days following receipt of the samples.  Results of the analyses for each sample set will be sent to EPA every 21 calendar days after receipt of the initial samples until all analyses are completed.Sample Description, Collection and Delivery Schedule:	
Liquid filtrate samples require immediate processing, while processing of the resulting frozen filtered retentate portion of the samples are not as time sensitive.  Table A enumerates the total number of samples generated during the four sampling events.  - For each of the Sampling Events, samples generated during the day 1, week 1, and week 2 runs will occur over a staggered 2 ? 3 day time frame.  Thus, sample shipments will occur each day for 2-3 days as samples are generated for each of the three runs.  Liquid sample shipments will not exceed a total of 12 filtrate samples for any given day of sampling and shipping.  - Manure and sediment samples will be shipped frozen and will be analyzed within the same time frame as specified for the filter retentate solids. 
EPA will notify the contractor of the anticipated sample ship dates as soon as they are known.Deliverables: 1) The contractor will set up an initial conference call with EPA within three business days of award of this contract to discuss the anticipated start date for this project which is dependent on the outcome of pilot testing of the rainfall simulators currently being carried out by EPA researchers.  The contractor will also at this time discuss, for final details and approval, any other analytical method or any modification to the Standard EPA Method 1698: Steroids and Hormones in Water, Soil, Sediment, and Biosolids by HRGC/HRMS (December 2007) proposed by the contractor in the contract proposal and accepted by EPA for use in this work. 2) The work in this contract will result in the generation of primary data. Consistent with the Agency?s Quality Assurance (QA) requirements, the contractor must prepare a project-specific Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) and analysis plan to assure the quality of the primary data generated.  The QAPP shall specify data quality objectives, best practices and frequency, scope of appropriate QA reports, method performance information, recovery information, matrix spikes, and positive and negative controls clearly included in the sample processing protocol. 3) During each rainfall simulation run, EPA will collect samples for analysis of fecal sterols as outlined in table A of the SOW.  The samples will be shipped out on ice (filtrate at 2-4 degrees centigrade and filter retentate at minus 20 degrees centigrade) for receipt by the contractor to perform sterol within 24 hours of collection.  The fecal sterols to be analyzed are as stipulated in Table B of the SOW. 4) Preliminary data results for sterol analysis shall be provided to EPA no later 21 calendar days after sample receipt.  - Sampling Run: Day 1, Week 1, Week 2 ? Preliminary Report of Results for each sampling run are due 21 calendar days after sample receipt. The contractor shall have a 15 day period for preparation of the Sampling Event Final Report.  This period starts immediately after delivery of the last (?Week 2?) preliminary report.  Sampling Event Final Report ? Due 15 calendar days after completion of last preliminary report. 
Data described immediately above, should be provided electronically in an Excel file, summarizing samples grouped by run for each sampling event. This reporting procedure will be repeated four times --- once for each of the four sampling events.Refer to the Statement of Work for more details regarding this requirement.Evaluation Criteria: The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered. For this Request for Quotation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  This procurement will be awarded on a best value basis per the following evaluation criteria:  1) Capacity - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the capacity to process all samples according to the sample holding times and sample delivery as outlined in the SOW.  2) Methodology - The vendor must demonstrate that they have the equipment and capability to implement and conduct the standard method as provided, or demonstrate that they have experience conducting a viable, proven modified method for analysis of the sterols as identified.  3) Past Performance - Previous experience as evidenced by references (should provide 2 ? can be other types of analyses, not just sterol.   Include telephone number, name of contact, analyses provided, and date(s) service was provided.  4) Price

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This RFI is modifed to change the word "centralized" to "decentralized" as shown in BOLD below.&nbsp;</span> <br /><br />LASER PREDICTIVE AVOIDANCE FOR AIR &amp; SPACE APPLICATION
<p>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br />10-RD-RFI(HEL-JTO)</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) from interested parties by the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office (HEL-JTO), pertaining to concepts that address the potential need to develop a <strong>decentralized</strong> predictive avoidance capability that encompasses both the air and space arena. This Request for Information is published in accordance with FAR Part 15.201, and is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government, nor should it be construed as such. Respondents are advised that HEL-JTO is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or reimburse the costs incurred by providing the information requested under this notice. This RFI is open to any capable and qualified commercial source, and partnering is encouraged.</p>
<p>The HEL-JTO is interested in concepts and potential technology solutions that address the challenges associated with high energy laser system (HEL) operations in unrestricted airspace environments. The Department of Defense has established processes and procedures for the testing and demonstration of laser weapons under controlled environments, typically in restricted areas. As HEL weapon systems mature and become operational, the need for establishing a decentralized predictive avoidance capability is critical to their use. The HEL-JTO is interested in advanced fire control/command and control concepts that could become the standard fire control / predictive avoidance tool for all HEL weapon platforms.</p>
<p>Responses should consider but are not limited to, 1) Potential Laser Weapon System (LWS) platforms, missions, and performance characteristics and capabilities for monitoring LWS readiness, 2) capabilities to continuously monitor the State vectors of mobile LWS platforms and multiple targets, to monitor the source-to-target environmental conditions, and to control event sequences for target engagements, 3) the ability to interface with current and future Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control and avoid potential known air-space conflicts, 4) Fire Control System fail-safe capabilities that prevent unintentional target engagements and provide automated shutdown in the event that an air or space-based object enters the LWS target-engagement field-of-view (firing-zone). There may be other considerations and all will be considered.</p>
<p><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS:</p>
<p>1. There is no page limitation. Responses shall be delivered to Ms. Linda Buix, Contracting Officer, U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, AFRL/RDKL, 2251 Maxwell Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117, no later than December 22, 2009.

Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Richard Damron at 505-248-8200.</p>
<p>2. All respondents shall include their assigned Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code.</p>
<p>3. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees. Due to the nature of this potential effort, no foreign country sources will be considered.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary Data: All information submittals containing proprietary data shall be appropriately marked. It is the respondent's responsibility to clearly define to the Government what is considered to be proprietary data.</p>
<p>5. Responders are advised that any data submitted to the Government in response to this RFI will be released to non-Government advisors for review and analysis. The current non-Government advisor is Schafer Corporation, Chelmsford, MA. Any non-Government advisor will strictly serve in an advisory capacity to the Government. All Non-Government advisors have appropriate Organizational Conflict of Interest clauses in their contracts with HEL-JTO and have nondisclosure agreements on file with HEL-JTO. All responders must clearly indicate in their responses if they have any objections or concerns regarding the use of non-Government advisors.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - The Energy Research Group of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), in collaboration with the Technical Directorate of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), is seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a municipal waste stream of degradable organic waste within a high solids inflow to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited in a landfill from an Air Force installation.
<p>The Air Force is interested in demonstrating how biogas from anaerobic digestion of organic waste can be used to offset bioreactor operating expenses or enhance aerobic decomposition of waste for the following purposes: 1) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 2) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost); and 3) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills. A crucial element of the research and development approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Influent municipal waste solids would include glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic constituents. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment.</p>
<p>Anticipated total program funding is $5.832M with multiple awards possible.</p>
<p>Interested parties should contact the Technical or Contracting POC listed in this Synopsis.</p>

<a href="mailto:jenniffer.vazquez@us.army.mil">Fort Sam Houston Contracting Center - West</a>
<DESC>This ammendment shall serve to clarify items to be submitted under Section 2 of white paper, specifically section 4.3.5. RFI response date is NOT extended.<BR><BR>Description<BR>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Ft. Sam Houston is seeking information on how an interested contractor could meet the requirement to deliver software scheduling solution to assist METC.  METC is seeking a commercial off the shelf (COTS) or modified off the shelf solution. No prototypes or developmental solutions will be considered. <BR><BR>  <BR>Scope of work summary: (Please refer to attached Draft of Performance Work Statement (PWS) for additional information.<BR><BR>The METC requires a fully-hosted, internet-based COTS solution specifically designed to optimize logistics and scheduling for complex, high-volume training environments. The METC intends to initiate a 12 month initial phase to implement the software in view of ascertaining best practices, conducting business process reengineering and developing a methodical center-wide implementation strategy.  <BR>To this end, the successful vendor will be required to provide all of the hardware, software, hosting and professional services necessary to implement a turn-key enterprise-wide logistics, scheduling and training system solution, capable of scheduling all required facilities, instructional personnel and equipment and providing student housing capacity planning and reservation management down to the bed level, maintenance ticket management and tracking student check in/check outs.  The successful vendor will be required to stand up an initial operating capability within 45 days after award and a full operational capability ready for METC data load within 90 days of award.  The successful vendor shall provide an operational readiness up time of 99.99 for the hosted environment.  Additionally, the successful vendor shall provide for backup of the operational database and will provide a instance of the virtualized operating environment, data set and configuration data, that will be maintained within the METC data center virtualized environment.  In addition, the vendor will help identify and document those planning and coordination deficiencies that exist across the enterprise that either impede or reduce the overall timely delivery of effective and relevant training.  The contractor will support the METC in initial software configuration and data loading, Customization of the COTS product shall be limited to modification necessary to configure and tailor the application to METCs unique operating environment.  <BR>Upon the successful conclusion of the base period, the METC envisions that additional requirements will include future integration with existing system such as RITM (Resident Individual Training Management), ATTRS (Army Training Requirements and Resources System), TDC (Training Development Capability) and Blackboard (Learning Management System).  Since no two METC organizations are completely alike in their requirements, the system must be sufficiently flexible to adapt to fulfill future potential needs.<BR>Phased Approach.  It is desired that a three-phased approach be followed. This will allow the METC to evaluate its training workflow in the context of an automated system, refine its logistics processes and implement the enterprise solution.  In all three phases outlined below, the vendor will work with the government representative to propose alternative approaches based on Best Business practices (BBPs) that will allow change requirements to be implemented expeditiously throughout the Period of Performance without significant impacts or project cost.  Weekly meetings with the vendor are required to evaluate, approve, and prioritize enhancement requests. METCs preferred method of software customization will be agile development. Agile development will allow the METC to forge ahead at a rapid pace while providing adequate opportunity to reprioritize modifications as necessary.<BR>PHASE I  Initial Implementation (12 months).  During the initial implementation phase, the vendor will provide the turnkey system (hardware, software, professional services, hosting, training and support, backup and disaster recovery) to implement the system and automate initial METC courses (approximately 2,600 soldiers trained in 2010).  A successful implementation will include loading the necessary POIs (with associated resources, facilities and personnel) and those courses automatically being scheduled by the software via web-configurable business rules.  During the course of implementation, the vendor will document all functional requirements and workflows for these courses in order to support further implementation of the system. <BR>PHASE II  Enterprise implementation (12 months).  Upon successful completion of Phase I, the vendor will be required to travel to Ft. Sam Houston and deliver a formal In Process Review (IPR) to the Project Manager (PM)/Configuration Control Board (CCB) detailing project status, lessons learned and a methodical Phase II implementation strategy.  Given the operational tempo at METC, the PM/CCB will work with the vendor to develop an implementation plan that minimizes organizational disruption during system deployment.  In addition, at the direction of the METC TPOC the vendor will provide the following training classes to designated METC scheduling personnel:<BR><BR>1.	Data load workshop (1 week)<BR>2.	Onsite Classroom Training(1 week/20 students)<BR>3.	Custom Webcast Training<BR>4.	Train the Trainer class (2 weeks/25 students)<BR>5.	Support and Maintenance<BR><BR>PHASE III  Operations and Maintenance (24 months).  Once fully implemented, the system will move to an Operations and Maintenance phase.  The vendor will be required to provide ongoing hosting, help desk support, software patches, upgrades and server administration as well as ongoing support and training.<BR>Period of Performance.  The Period of Performance (PoP) will be for one base year from the date of contract award with three 1-year contract options.  The implementation, outlined in Phase 1 must be concluded no later than twelve months from the date of the contract award.<BR>Contract work location. Work performed in accordance with this PWS shall be at Fort Sam Houston, TX and at off-site contractor facilities.  Systems analysis for modifications, data load, and training will be completed both on and off site as directed by the COR.  Software modifications will be performed primarily off-site at contractor facilities.  <BR><BR>1.1 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. <BR>This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement solely for information and planning purposes it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.<BR><BR>2.0 Background<BR> The intent of this effort is to identify a common solution set that will function to provide Enterprise-wide scheduling, operational modeling and a decision support tool that would assist METC with establishing a multi-echelon common operating picture. <BR><BR>2.1 Planned Delivery Period: Prospective vendor will be required to stand up an initial operating capability within 45 days after award and a full operational capability ready for METC data load within 90 days of award.  <BR><BR>3.0 Requested Information. <BR>MICC Center Ft. Sam Houston is interested in gathering information from Industry on what systems are currently in existence with the capabilities identified above and in the draft performance work statement. Additionally, information should address any details on system requirements and capabilities, costs, normal or specialized hardware and/or software requirements, compatibilities issues, etc. <BR><BR>4.0 Responses. <BR><BR>4.1 Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror using the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Procedures.

<DESC>Questions and Answers: November 19, 2009.
Q: Is this a new contract?
A: Yes, this is a new requirement.
Q: Provide a range of expected value for the contract, either one year or for all five.
A: The anticipated contract value is $30M (for the life of the contract).
Q: How many contacts does DOE NE expect to award?
A: DOE anticipates awarding 3 ? 5 contracts.
Q: When is the expected start date of the contract?
A: DOE anticipates the start date to be March 1, 2010.
Q: Will contact award preclude a contactor from working on future NE projects?  If a task is for conceptual design, will completing the task be a conflict of interest issue for detail design?
A: DOE does not believe there will be any OCI, but this will be considered at the individual task order level, on a case-by-case basis, and done so IAW procedures specified at FAR 9.506.
Q: Will there be a task order to support a full time program management office?
A: No
Q: Will this contract have anything to do with supporting nuclear facility licensing applications?
A: No.
The following Q/As were posted on November 18, 2009
Q: If multiple ID/IQ contract awards are granted, will all awardees have the same scope of services? 
A: Yes, but individual task orders issued under the basic or master contract may be different to a specific awardee (so long as the task order scope falls within the scope of the master contract).
Q: Will subsequent tasks issued under these contracts be competitively bid among the awardees?
A: Yes, individual tasks with an estimated value >$3M will normally be competed IAW FAR 16.505, as well as IAW any specific ordering procedures specified in the contract.  Provision is made to not compete orders as well when specific statutory exceptions apply, e.g., the agency need for the  services is so urgent that providing for such competition would result in unacceptable delays; only one awardee is capable of providing the services required at the level of quality required because the services ordered are unique or highly specialized, etc. 
Q: Must the offerors/awardees have an office in Idaho Falls, ID and/or the metropolitan Washington DC area?
A: No, unless such a need is specifically and legitimately called for to perform successfully on an individual order(s).
Q: What is the budget for the requested services? Will there be a minimum award to successful awardees?
A: This information will be available in the Request for Proposal.  There is no specific "budget" for the basic or master contract; the basic contract will be a contract for services that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the performance of tasks during the period of the contract.  Each contract will specify a guaranteed minimum quantity; this amount must be more than a nominal quantity; the Government?s obligation under each basic contract is limited to this minimum quantity specified.  Each contract will also specify a maximum quantity that can be ordered both on a specific order basis, as well as an overall maximum that can be ordered against the basic over the life of the basic contract.  The "budgets" or amounts for individual orders shall be specified on each order issued.
Q: Can you please confirm that under the terms of (FAR) Part 15, universities, colleges, and national laboratories and their Maintenance and Operations (M&O) contractors could be considered as subcontractors to a team to support this opportunity?  A: It is acceptable to utilize universities, colleges, and national laboratories and their Maintenance and Operations (M&O) contractors as teaming partners for this opportunity? 
Q:  Is it allowable to submit questions for this Presolicitation through the email address listed in the presolicitation notice?
A:  Yes; however after today (November 18, 2009), questions related to the presolicitation notice will not be accepted.
The following Q/As were posted November 17, 2009 
Q:  If I am not able to access FedConnect, am I able to submit my questions directly to your email address?
A:  Yes.  Your questions and corresponding answers will be posted for you.
Q:  What is required of me for the November 18th due date?
A:  Nothing.  This is the final date to receive questions/answers.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA’s use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA’s evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a request fail to materialize, no basis for claims against NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. 

Scope:
The U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors.  Research areas include:  alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services.  The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations.  Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.

Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver’s ability to safely operate his/her car have not provided definitive outcomes.  Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence.  The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs.  This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.  

The evaluation is very extensive, and therefore time-consuming for the officer.  The DRE collects information on the suspect’s current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect’s pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function.  The DRE also examines the suspect’s visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively).  This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) “Face Sheet”, by all DREs.  Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form.  The DRE also summarizes his or her account of the evaluation in a descriptive statement.  Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.  

There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures is more directly relevant.  In order to determine the most efficient approach to assessing drivers for recent drug use, it is imperative to ascertain the most critical elements needed to perform the evaluation.  Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) of elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.  

The objectives of this study are to:
(a)	gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;
(b)	code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample; and
(c)	analyze the data to identify groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.

Capability
The corporate capability statement is expected to address the capabilities required to support the Scope section above. 

The Offerors should have:
(a)	experience in research methodology and design;
(b)	experience making contacts to obtain local, state, and federal data;
(c)	experience working with Institutional Review Boards;
(d)	experience in obtaining traffic safety data, including archival and observational data (e.g., DWI arrest records; enforcement activity; police stops; license suspense records; seat belt observations; speed measurement; underage drinking behavior; public attitudes concerning laws, sanctions, or traffic safety programs; public awareness of enforcement programs; crash and fatality data);
(e)	experience with and knowledge of research on the incidence of drug use/abuse, the impairing effects of alcohol and other drugs, and the impact of drug use on driving;
(f)	experience with statistical analyses (especially multivariate analyses and statistical modeling), using the types of data noted above; 
(g)	experience with drawing appropriate conclusions based on available data, and ability to describe study limitations;
(h)	experience working with Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and other confidential materials; and
(i)	report writing that is appropriate for both researchers and non-researchers.


Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:
Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the Offeror’s ability, in no more than 10 pages, to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, for example, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response.

<SUBJECT>Public Service Announcement Marketing Campaign
<SOLNBR>2010-0003
<RESPDATE>120209
<CONTACT>Lloyd S. Blackwell, Phone 202-366-9564, Email lloyd.blackwell@nhtsa.dot.gov
<DESC>The purpose of this statement of work is for the acquisition of services and products required by NHTSA to field a successful and effective public service campaign: refinement of a campaign strategy and focus, technical assistance, creation of multimedia advertising products to carry out the strategy, dissemination of multimedia products to national and local media outlets, development and placement, and monitoring and reporting the results of media placement efforts.

The campaign’s objectives are to:
•	Develop and deliver national public information campaigns featuring varied media approaches to increase occupant protection use;
•	Demonstrate proper use; and
•	Illustrate how to select, fit and wear occupant restraints that meet Federal safety standards.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation whose primary mission is to reduce deaths, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes. 

This is accomplished by:
•	Setting and enforcing national safety performance standards for motor vehicles and equipment;
•	Researching and demonstrating promising strategies to influence positive traffic safety behaviors;
•	Providing grants to state and local government to enable them to conduct effective local highway safety programs; and
•	Planning and executing strategic communication campaigns to support program activity.

Motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the United States, providing an unprecedented degree of mobility. Yet for all its advantages, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for people of every age from 3 through 34 (based on 2006 data). Traffic fatalities accounted for more than 90 percent of transportation-related fatalities.  

Research has demonstrated that increasing safety belt use and preventing impaired driving have significant impact on meeting NHTSA’s core goals however the Agency needs to have the ability to develop new communication strategies to address current, new, and emerging traffic safety issues since a number of factors contribute to traffic deaths and injuries.

While highly visible enforcement activity continues to be an anchor for NHTSA’s national communications program, other integrated communications activity must continue throughout the year to keep the message fresh and in front of the American public. Public attention must continue to be reminded of the horrific human and economic costs of motor vehicle crashes. Effective communication must be maintained not only with the strategic target audiences, but policy makers must also be made aware of the potential lifesaving actions they can take to alleviate these problems.

The purpose of this statement of work is for the acquisition of services and products required by NHTSA to field successful and effective public service campaigns: refinement of campaign strategy and focus, technical assistance, creation of multimedia advertising products to carry out strategies, dissemination of multimedia products to national and local media outlets, development and placement, and monitoring and reporting the results of media placement efforts.

The services will consist of Photogrammetric Mapping, Aerial Photography, GIS mapping, Remote Sensing, Aerotriangulation, Large and Small-Scale Topographic Maps, and Landuse/Landcover Analysis and Mapping for the St. Louis District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The Government intends to negotiate and award up to four indefinite delivery contracts within one year after the required response date to this solicitation.  If there are not enough qualified contractors to fill any or all of the contracts the resulting capacity will be shifted to unrestricted contracts.  The solicitation does not supersede contracts previously awarded for similar work by other Corps Districts.  Each contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four option periods not to exceed one year each.  The amount of work in each contract period for each contract will not exceed $2,000,000.00 ($10,000,000 per contract). An option period may be exercised when the contract amount for the base period or preceding option period has been exhausted or nearly exhausted.  Furthermore, any unused capacity may be rolled over to the next contract period at the Governments sole discretion.  Yearly rate schedules with annual cost escalation will be negotiated for the contracts.  On each individual contract, the first years rate schedule shall become effective the day of contract award and shall be in effect for one year from contract award regardless when the option period is exercised.  Subsequent rate schedules shall become effective on the yearly anniversary dates from contract award.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm fixed price task orders not to exceed the contract amount.  The Contracting Officer will consider the following and other relevant factors in deciding which Contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, uniquely specialized experience and an equitable distribution of work among Contractors.  The contracts will be for requirements within the United States and its territories.  This contract is set aside for small business only.

<p>Proposal Submission Place:<br />Mr. Cabir Niyazov<br />Ecological Department of Socar<br />State Oil Company of Azerbaijan<br />H.Aliyev Avenue, 113<br />Baku, Azerbaijan AZ1029<br />Telephone: +994 12 521 08 01</p>
<p>Azerbaijan: Socar Waste Mangement Facility Project</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to <br />a) evaluate the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of developing a new (or upgraded) waste management facility in Azerbaijan. <br />b) Provide suggestions for the design, construction, and operation of the facility.</p>
<p>SOCAR's current operations generate a wide variety of wastes including drilling mud, oil-contaminated soil, waste oil, tires, formation water, and solid waste such as plastics, wood, and electronic waste. In addition, oil-contaminated soils exist in a great number of locations throughout the Absheron Peninsula which SOCAR plans to remediate. Currently, SOCAR manages a single 45,000 m3 landfill in the Garadagh District that commenced operations in 1985, for the final disposal of a portion of the oil-contaminated soils from remediation and from drilling activities. This six cell landfill, however, has structural flaws (e.g., cracks in the concrete liner) and needs to be replaced. Along with the need to dispose of waste generated from ongoing remediation efforts, one of SOCAR's highest priorities is to establish a new waste management facility (or an upgrade of the existing facility) that will process the wastes from SOCAR operations (past and present) as well as from its approximately 120 subsidiaries.</p>

<DESC>November 18, 2009								In Reply Refer To: 69D/GLAC

SUBJ:	Determination and Findings re: Solicitation Cancellation of VA-69D-09-IB-0519, SCI Connecting Corridor for Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
FINDINGS
1.  It was discovered after bid opening that additional scope is required to fully complete the SCI Connecting Corridor project.  Specifically, the On-Call Room, On-Call Bathroom and On-Call Storage Room will be displaced by building the new SCI Connecting Corridor elevator.  These rooms will need to be rebuilt adjacent to the new corridor.  The need for the relocation of the rooms was omitted from the original plans and specifications.  These omissions are estimated to add a significant amount to the overall cost of the contract.  This additional scope is required to correctly and completely finish the project.  If this work is omitted, it will result in selected demolition of new corridor construction and rework, resulting in additional cost to the government. 
DETERMINATION
Due to the lack of inclusion of the On-Call Room, the On-Call Bathroom, and the On-Call Storage Room in the original solicitation and subsequent amendments, and in accordance with FAR 14.404-1(c)(2), the contracting officer has determined that the course of action most advantageous to the government is to cancel solicitation number VA-69D-09-IB-0519 and reissue under a new solicitation number with revised plans, specifications and scope of work to reflect the additional requirements.  
Solicitation # VA-69D-09-IB-0519 is hereby cancelled.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER: SEAPORT-E TASK ORDER N00178-04-D-4030-FD03.  This effort is necessary to provide instrumentation support for model testing associated with Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) System Development for Surface Combatants project for the DDG 51 Class Ships.  Note: this effort was initially awarded on June 17, 2009, as part of a larger funding action under modification 41 to this Task Order N00178-04-D-4030-FD03.  The total amount obligated under modification 41 was $418,350; of which Recovery Act funds were $30,000 and the remaining $388,350 were non-Recovery Act funds.  An individual Contract Subline Item (SLIN) has been established for this effort.  The purpose for the instant action is to identify this effort in the Recovery Act Reporting system.  This action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because it was a modification to an existing task order under SeaPort-e and it was not awarded as a fixed-price type contract because this effort is closely associated with other on-going work under the task order in which uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVALFOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).1.	Contracting ActivityDepartment of Veterans AffairsCenter for Acquisition Innovation (CAI) 7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD 217032.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved: The Department of Veterans Affairs, Center for Acquisition Innovation (CAI) plans to contract with Gartner, Inc.: for a Gartner Analyst to lead a VA workshop in utilizing the Gartner Program and Portfolio Management (PPM) Maturity model and begin development plans for the maturity elevation of programs within the Enterprise Infrastructure Engineering (EIE) Program Management Office (PMO).3.	Description of Service and Supplies: The EIE PMO needs to procure on a sole source basis a Gartner Analyst for a one day workshop to be held on December 8, 2009, for a Firm Fixed price of $11,200.00.The objective of this purchase order is to utilize the expertise and PPM Maturity models of Gartner. Gartner, Inc. currently has a contract with the VA to provide access to their material, models, staffing/skill set models, ongoing research and other management related tool information through their extensive library of published material relating to PPM Maturity.4.	Statutory Authority: FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:Gartner, Inc. has been under contract with the VA for the past two years providing material and models that were utilized in building the EIE PMO PPM Maturity model and in establishing their office. The EIE PMO constructed their processes around these models based on the proven track record of Gartner and the recognition that they are an industry leader in the Information Technology (IT) field. The EIE PMO developed their models from the Gartner information obtained through the current contract to assess the current state of the EIE PMO programs and have only made modest progress. By having a Gartner Analyst leading the workshop to be held on December 8, 2009, guiding and ratifying the plans and documents with the key Office of Information &Technology (0I&T) players, will help maintain the progress made to date and ensure continued success is achieved in the development of the PPM Maturity model. This effort is a continuation of the services that have been received through the existing Gartner contract; however, Gartner does not offer a contract line item for the support of an analyst under their existing contract. Therefore, a separate purchase order will have to be awarded in order to obtain these services.6.	Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources; Market Research Conducted; and Sources which expressed interest in writing:Other sources were contacted but the approach and material that they offered was not what the VA requires at this time.7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price. The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on historical data, price analysis, and negotiations.8.	Other Supporting Data: Due to the fact that Gartner workshops are based on their copyrighted material and models, no other source will satisfy the VA's requirement.9.	Barriers to competition for subsequent acquisitions: As future requirements become available, competition will be sought.CertificationThe information contained in this justification for other than full and open competition is certified accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Technical/Requirements Cognizance 	11/18/09Date	Cheryl A. CapponTitle: Administrative Officer		 ApprovalI certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate. 	Date: 11/19/2009	Contracting Officer Burzie C. Baker Ill
