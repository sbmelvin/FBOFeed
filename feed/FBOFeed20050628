The supplier is the only manufacturer for this equipment. The current method of moving fish out of a channel is to have a man crowd the fish into a large bale net suspended on a stinger attached to a fork lift.  The pescalator will fit into existing space requirements and eliminate the present safety hazard for personnel.  The process will make it comfortable for the fish as they will  remain in water.  This is the safest and most efficient method to move fish from the holding area to the production area. PLACE/DELIVERY:  Quilcene National Fish Hatchery, Quilcene, WA

<DESC>This project is for the construction of a public water supply well.  The well is an existing well that was previously drilled to a depth of 420 feet.  The top 105 feet was drilled as a 12” hole and an 8-inch steel casing was set and grouted.  The remainder of the well was drilled open hole to a depth of 420 feet.  The previous well driller began to develop the well by surging with air pressure, but encountered equipment and personnel problems and abandoned the site before he was completed.  The well was still producing muddy water, the last time he was on the site.  The well was never fully developed, nor pump tested.  

Work under this contract will include, well development, pump testing, furnishing and installing PVC casing, supplying and installing a submersible pump, and electrical and water pipe from the well to 10’ from the casing.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Office of Freight Operations has a need to study selected States’ Overweight Commercial Vehicle permitting programs to determine their methods of operation and their procedures for issuing permits to commercial motor carries for oversize (OS) and overweight (OW) loads.  The objectives of this study are to describe the basis (e.g. legislative, economic, environmental) for each surveyed State’s issuance of OS/OW permits to commercial motor carriers, define the scope of issuance activity (e.g. single-trip, multi-trip, season-specific, commodity-specific), identify where permitted OS/OW operations take place within the sample State, determine the extent to which commercial motor carriers seek permits and the major reasons, identify State methods for tracking OS/OW operations (if any), evaluate State screening preceding permit award, compare state permit fee structures, and determine how revenues from permit issuances are used.   The contractor will develop and propose appropriate statistical methodologies to gather a robust sample of quantitative and qualitative information about various States’ OS/OW permit operations.  NO FURTHER SOLICITATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This solicitation, all related documents, and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://eps.arnet.gov under the “EPS for Vendors” option followed by selection of the “DOT” center.  Accordingly, no written, telephone, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.

Be sure to “Register to receive all notices from selected organization”.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for any solicitation amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by FHWA.

<DESC>The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and tools necessary to perform at Offutt AFB, NE and designated areas.   This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing support on behalf of Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for modeling and integration work in support of The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) and Battlespace Environment Institute (BEI).  The ESMF collaboration is building high-performance, flexible software infrastructure to increase ease of use, performance portability, interoperability, and reuse in climate, numerical weather prediction, data assimilation, and other Earth science applications.  The ESMF defines an architecture for composing multi-component applications and includes data structures and utilities for developing model components.  ESMF is aiming to create a framework usable by individual researchers as well as major operational and research centers, and seeks to engage the community in its development.  ESMF is on schedule and will be the dominant whole-earth framework for decades to come.

DoD established the Battlespace Environments Institute (BEI) within the broad ESMF, of which, AFWA is a co-founder.  This will allow DoD to tailor access to 19 major earth system modeling components and 30 ESMF applications to meet its requirements.  The BEI will foster cross-service and cross-agency collaborations and savings, and the rapid transfer of new models to support DoD Battlespace Environments Missions. The emphasis of this requirement is to exploit existing technology, establish a close working relationship between AFWA and the earth scientists and computational experts from major U.S. Earth modeling centers, and assist AFWA in fulfilling its set of BEI obligations. More specifically, the short- and long- term space weather model development goals of a multi-year project 

Requirements include but not limited to are: 1) Establish definitions, evaluation methodologies, metrics, presentation formats, and contribution policies for a Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) high-performance computing benchmark with relevance to AFWA operational requirements and the WRF user community at large.  2) Establish a WRF parallel benchmark web presence on the maintained WRF web site, also accessible through the official BEI web site. 3) Select a WRF benchmark case, preferably a case that coincides with a theater configuration targeted for operational implementation at AFWA.  4) Establish a threshold (minimum) set of benchmarks should be generated for the following series of super computing machines: IBM P4, Cray X1 and Origin 3000.  5) Act as the technical lead and objective officiator, final arbitrator and judge for all generic and vendor-specific optimizations made to officially released WRF baseline codes by hardware and/or software engineers working for AFWA and/or BEI.  6) Establish an objective verification method to determine the effects of generic and vendor-specific optimizations on the WRF benchmark case solution(s).  7) Make available starting WRF baseline (V 2.0.3.1) and all follow-on, optimized releases to the numerical weather prediction community off of the official WRF and the BEI mirror web sites.  8) Improved WRF performances should be tracked, quantified, graphically depicted and displayed on the WRF and BEI web sites on an as needed basis.  9) Ensure that WRF can interoperate as a coupled component within ESMF, to the extent that this can be done without compromising WRF performance or functionality for other users, applications, or coupling modalities.  10) Investigate feasibility of extending or integrating ESMF coupling mechanisms and approaches with other existing mechanisms and approaches to coupling (e.g. I/O API based techniques).  11) Participate in relevant BEI meetings and other activities, traveling when necessary and appropriate.  12) Consult and provide limited technical support to BEI application groups using WRF as a coupled component within ESMF.  13) Collaborate with the AFWA BEI team on the design of the extended space weather forecast system (coupled Hakamada-Akasofu-Fry (HAF) - Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM) GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM within the ESMF).  13) Install and generate a proof-of-concept, retrospective run of a one-way coupled the HAF-GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM systems (outside the bounds of the ESMF) on AFWA’s development system.  14) Work with scientists and AFWA to devise an integrated software development plan to deliver prototypes real-time, one-way coupled HAF-GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM modeling systems that is ESMF compliant/compatible.  15) Generate and provide WRF parallel benchmarks using the latest official release of the WRF modeling system, V 2.0.3.1.  16) Generate benchmarks using a case preferable to AFWA and coincident with a theater configuration targeted for operational implementation.  17) Work with the AFWA BEI team will generate a threshold (minimum) set of benchmarks for the following series of super computing machines: IBM P4 and P5, Cray X1 and Cray XD1, and SGI Altix 3700.  Objective set of benchmarks may also include Cray XT3 results. 18) Work with scientists to establish an objective verification method to determine the effects of generic and vendor-specific optimizations on the WRF benchmark case solution(s). 

Required support is commercial; therefore, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, shall apply to this acquisition.  The contractor shall perform in accordance with the standards outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Four statements of work will be posted.  This acquisition will be solicited as a Request for Proposals (RFP) utilizing FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  A requirements contract will result from the solicitation.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (N3CA) has revised its timeline for this project (IFB-CO-11560-OPL). NC3A intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of a Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) radio network in support of Stages 1 and 2 of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) Expansion.

The estimated value of this procurement is not available at this time.

NC3A was nominated as Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The Committee noted that the project will be handled under the Two-Stage Authorization Procedure. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is IFB-CO-11560-OPL and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFIB/IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

NATO has envisioned the need to establish an ISAF FM-radio network in Afghanistan to transmit over-the-air broadcasts to the ISAF target audience, the citizens of Afghanistan. (The radio broadcast studio and satellite transmission/reception terminals are established and are not part of this project.) This project main objective is to acquire the equipment and services necessary to allow for the rebroadcast of the original ISAF-generated audio 
within nine Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) areas, including possibly 20 remote areas surrounding their local periphery. To meet this objective, the contractor must perform radio coverage analysis for the broadcast areas, procure equipment (including power systems, housing for the equipment and operating personnel), and provide installation, maintenance activities and associated training to operate designated nodes of the radio network.     

At each of the nine PRT sites, the delivered equipment will accept an in-place digital audio signal and broadcast that signal over-the-air in a commercial FM band to a local Afghan radio audience. It is anticipated that some of those PRT sites will have the physical space and geographical characteristics to allow the contractor to connect radio transmission equipment directly to the satellite terminal receiving the digital audio signal. Other sites will require the contractor to provide additional equipment to retransmit the digital audio signal from the PRT satellite terminal to the remote radio transmission equipment. Contractor-hired personnel are to be responsible for the operation and physical security of the project equipment.

Additionally, it is anticipated that up to 20 remote areas will require coverage for which the PRT transmission sites are unable to effectively reach. In such circumstances, the contractor will propose locations within the main transmitter footprint to install additional equipment that can re-broadcast the PRT-FM transmission in order to extend the coverage to more remote areas. Contractor-hired personnel are to be responsible for the operation and physical security of the equipment. At the radio broadcast studio site, some miscellaneous communication equipment will be required to interface the digital audio signal from the radio broadcast studio (through in-place bandwidth managers) to the VSAT terminal multicasting the audio stream.

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

Radio coverage analysis of broadcast areas;

FM over-the air re-broadcast;

Retransmission of FM radio signal between PRT satellite terminal and FM transmission equipment (when equipment not physically co-located together);

Complete power generation for project equipment:
24-7 requirement for the nine PRT sites,
Backup power generation for remote locations;

Environmentally controlled sheltering for project equipment (at PRT site locations), Sheltering for project equipment (at remote locations);

Interfacing the audio signal from the broadcasting studio into the NATO Bandwidth Management Equipment (BME); extracting the audio signal from the BME; interface the audio signal into the VSAT up-link;

Civil works associated with the contractor provided equipment;

Operations and periodic/emergency maintenance of equipment to be performed by the contractor;

Equipment must operate under the rigors of harsh climatic conditions;

All equipment acquired is to be transportable by military means, including air (C130/C160);

General training of ISAF personnel regarding operations of equipment at PRTs

INSTALLATION SCENARIOS:

Civil works preparation of the PRT site areas will be done by the contractor with regard to the project equipment requirements. The sequence and timing of the installations will be given according to the operational requirements of ISAF. All project equipment installation activities are to be done by the contractor.

Three different equipment installation scenarios are envisioned for the contract to perform:

Scenario 1: FM broadcast system located directly on a PRT compound;
Scenario 2: FM broadcast system located nearby a PRT compound;
Scenario 3: Radio repeater system located at a remote village site

IMPLEMENTATION:

This procurement generally consists of the same sets of equipment being installed and operated from different locations. Site equipment for each PRT will be independent from all other PRT sites with respect to operations. Implementation will be done in a sequence consistent with the operational requirements of ISAF.

LOGISTICS SUPPORT:

The contractor will be asked to provide a comprehensive Integrated Logistics Support package. This would include, but may not be limited to, providing: spare parts, warranty, periodic and emergency maintenance, technical documentation, as well as initial and follow-on training.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract to Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA to conduct a modification concept study for the addition of an external voltage current monitor to the Inboard Power Supply (IPS) control panel assembly used to power the Outboard Transducer Array Assembly, part of the AN/WSQ9 Signal Analysis System, and provide a tested prototype.  The basis for the sole source is that Instruments, Inc. is the designer and fabricator of the IPS units, and is currently under contract for additional units.  An external IPS Voltage Current monitor is required to address a safety hazard associated with troubleshooting and isolating IPS failures.  Presently, voltage and current monitoring test points used as troubleshooting aids are located behind the IPS Front Cover Assembly, which can expose technicians to electric shock.  The external monitor must be form, fit and functionally representative of the corresponding baseline assemblies, which are currently built by Instruments, Inc.  Their IPS units are the only power supply units that are “submarine qualified” for use in the AN/WSQ9 system.  The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source using SAP and commercial item procedures as set forth in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the closing date will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  Price evaluation preference will be given to HUBZone Small Business concerns, in accordance with FAR 52.219-4.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS’ INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS’ BEST TERMS.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation/revitalization/alteration, and repair primarily by design-build or secondarily by design-bid-build of various bachelor enlisted quarters, bachelor officer quarters, and lodges at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility including, but not limited to, Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (Architect-Engineer) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  In an effort to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Offerors are encouraged to offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months.  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months.  For each contract, the estimated maximum dollar value over the base year and all four option periods combined is $100,000,000.  Task orders will range between $3,000,000 and $30,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following:  Factor 1 – Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 – Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach; Factor 5 – Engineering Solutions of Offeror’s Team (based on Proposed Task Order 0001); and Factor 6 – Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows: 14% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 13% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 2% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; - and 35% Other Small Business.  Source Selection procedures will be used and award may be made to the Offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Proposed Task Order (PTO) 0001 includes all labor, materials and equipment necessary to design and construct a new 200 room Bachelor Enlisted Quarters (BEQ) at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to increase the level of effort for the duration of the existing contract (PBGC01-CT-03-0668) with BAE Systems (formerly User Technology Associates (UTA)) for operating and managing PBGC's computer hardware located in the Corporate Computer Center, LAN rooms and at the WAN sites as well as performing tape back-up and restore activity.  The additional level of effort is required to accommodate more monitoring and back-up activity resulting from the significant increase in PBGC hardware and data created by the trusteeship of pension plans.  The contractor has also been tasked with additional backup reporting requirements.  This is a continuation of work already undertaken by the existing provider. It is in the best interest of the PBGC for the current provider to complete this work by increasing the hours under the existing contract. This increase under the existing contract will ensure continuity in the work.  This is not a request for proposal. See Note 22.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) (formerly known as the Health Care Financing Administration) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with 3M Health Information Systems for the services outlined below:

Section 507 of the MMA requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to study physician-owned cardiac, surgery, and orthopedic specialty hospitals, and to report the results of their studies to Congress.  After reviewing the results of the studies, CMS stated that it would assess four methodological reforms related to payments for inpatient hospital services.  

1.	Refine DRGs to more fully capture differences in severity of illness
2.	Base DRG weights on estimated cost of providing care
3.	Base DRG weights on national average of hospitals’ relative values in each DRG
4.	Adjust DRG weights to account for differences in prevalence of high-cost outlier cases

This procurement will allow these reforms to be studied using a proprietary severity of illness system, the “all payer refined DRGs (APR-DRGs),” which was referenced by both MedPAC and CMS in recommending solutions.    

The government anticipates a period of performance for twelve (12) months from date of award.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  See number Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The form has two parts: Part I  Contract-Specific Qualifications, and Part II  General Qualification.  Although there has been a sligh t delay in the implementation, firms interested in the electronic submission of a Standard Form 330 Part II will soon be able to submit it to the Business Partn er Network (BPN) at www.bpn.gov.  For a logon and password, firms will use their DUNS number and the Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) they selected when registering on the CCR web site, www.ccr.gov.  Part II is prepared on a branch office bas is, which aligns with the assignment of DUNS Numbers.  Submission of the SF 330 Part II to the BPN is voluntary.  However, it will increase a firms visibility in the Federal marketplace and may lead to opportunities for contracts that are exempt from publ ic announcement.  Do not submit a SF 254 or a SF 330 Part II to the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS). ACASS will be modernized in late 2005 to retrieve the SF330 Part II data from BPN and make it available to contracting ag encies.  Until then, agencies will require A-E firms to submit Parts II with Part I when responding to a solicitation of A-E Services.  A Part II is required for each branch office of the prime firm and any subcontractors that will have a key role in the p roposed contract.  After ACASS is modernized, contracting agencies have the option of requesting firms submit Part II with Part I or retrieving Part II from ACASS is a firm has one on file in BPN.  You may direct any policy questions on the SF 330 Part II to Marilyn Nedell at the ACASS Center at 503-80804590, or by email at Marilyn.B.Nedell@usace.army.mil.  Use the help feature on BPN for general questions about the use of BPN.  In order to comply with Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1966, all contractor s must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be considered for award of a federal contract.  For information regarding registration, contact: CCR Web site at http://www.ccr.gov.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  This is not a request for proposal

<SOLNBR>W9O9MY-05-R-0007
<RESPDATE>080905
<ARCHDATE>10082005
<CONTACT>Patricia Davis, 703-325-1713
<DESC>It is the intent of the CECOM Acquisition Center Washington to issue a competitive Request for Proposal for the 60,000 BTU/HR Improved Environmental Control Unit (60K IECU) program.  The 60K IECU program is a joint Army and Air Force effort to replac e heavy and inefficient field environmental control units that utilize ozone-depleting refrigerants.  The proposed full and open competitive acquisition will result in a single contract award.  The single acquisition will be executed in three phases:  1) a n 18-month Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase, 2) a 6-month Firm-Fixed-Price option for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Phase, and 3) 5 one-year Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity options for the Full Rate Production (FRP) Phase.  During the SDD phase, the selected contractor will be required to design and fabricate 8 prototype 60K IECUs to support Production Qualification Testing, Logistics Demonstration and a field user evaluation . If the LRIP option is exercised, the contractor will be required to deliver 60 LRIP units for First Article Testing.  If exercised, the FRP phase will occur over a 5 one year periods and it is anticipated that a maximum of 5,747 IECUs will be acquired du ring this phase.  The 60K IECU will be a replacement for the existing Army 54,000-Btu/hr ECU and the Air Force developed 66,000-Btu/hr Field Deployable Environmental Control Unit (FDECU).  The 60K IECU will be much lighter in weight than these existing mil itary standard ECUs which are currently used to provide environmental control capability to Force Provider, Deployable Medical Systems, Tactical Operations Centers, and other joint services including the Air Force.  The need for the lightweight 60K IECU is  shared by all services especially the Army and Air Force who are striving to reduce the logistics footprint and increase system deployability.  Present and emerging command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissanc e (C4ISR) systems require environmental control to moderate the environmental temperatures in which these systems operate.  The key performance driver and constraint for military systems today and in the future is system weight.  Additionally, the primary shortcoming is that refrigerants for existing military standard (MIL-STD) ECUs use ozone depleting hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), namely HCFC-22.   This ozone depleting chemical has been regulated according to a specific schedule that prohibits its manu facture after 1 January 2010, and bans its use altogether by 1 January 2020 for servicing of existing equipment.  These phase-out dates occur much earlier in some allied nations where the U.S. Army must continue to operate.  Additionally, existing MIL-STD ECUs are becoming increasingly unreliable due to lifecycle expiration and/or are no longer supportable by Army logistics and training systems.  MIL-STD ECUs and their associated components were designed to operate with ozone depleting refrigerants and cann ot be economically modified to accept environmentally friendly alternatives.  These ECUs in all sizes and configurations will not meet stated domestic legal requirements or international agreements and shall be used until no longer repairable and then repl aced with the Family of IECUs.  A recent revalidation to the IECU ORD was approved that identified new requirements for 60K Btu/hr and 120K Btu/hr capacity IECU systems. Performance parameters set forth in the ORD include reduced power consumption, reduced  weight/logistics footprint, increased reliability, compatible with current military shelter systems as 'drop-in' replacement for MIL-SD ECUs including FDECU, elimination of ozone depleting refrigerants and designed to field and sustainment level maintenan ce.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on the Interactive Business Opportunity Page (IBOP), https://abop.monmouth.army.mil on or about 5 July  2005.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 1 to Solicitation No. 14350405RP43251 is as follows: 1.  To correct the following sentence of the announcement posted to FedBizOpps on June 22nd, as indicated in bold: It is expected that the resultant Contractor will have to travel to Kansas City, MO; Davis, California; Raleigh, North Carolina; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Illinois; and, Valdosta, Georgia. 2.  To revise paragraph C.1.3 of Section C.3 of the SOW as follows, as indicated in bold: The Contractor's evaluation shall include interview sessions with applicable RMA RO specialists or staff from the five RMA RO's (Davis, California; Raleigh, North Carolina; Spokane, Washington; Springfield, Illinois; and, Valdosta, Georgia) with responsibilities for perennial Category C APH crops growing areas.  Information on these RMA RO's can be found at: http://www.rma.usda.gov/aboutrma/fields/rsos.html 3.  Questions and Answers The following concerns were posed in regards to this solicitation. Please note that the verbiage of the concerns may have been revised, but have not lost their significance. A.   Q- Can geographical areas other than those listed in paragraph C.1.3 of Section C.3 of the SOW, Specific Tasks & Work Assignment, be proposed for the interview sessions? A- RMA limited the RMA ROs to the five that have the largest number of perennial Category C APH crop programs and contracts.  This was done with the intention of trying to controlling the cost of the contract.  These offices are also the ones RMA utilizes and has on the Perennial Crop Workgroup.  RMA believed that this should not limit the contractor's ability to gather data and make meaningful analysis, evaluations and any proposed changes that may be applied in all regions.  B.   Q- As a concern with more than $6M in average revenue, would we be eligible to be a subcontractor to a prime contractor who qualified as a small business concern? A- A large business can act as a subcontractor to a small business.  However, please see the clause at 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.

<DESC>This contract requires the Contractor to produce and deliver specified quantities of the AIP and demonstrate by testing that the initial deliveries conform to Government specifications.  Deliveries of AIP during option years of this contract will be used by the Government (not the Contractor) to test the operational utility of AIP prior to any Government decision to fully deploy AIP.  The AIP will be used in conjunction with the standard 463L Cargo Nets, Pallets and associated material handling equipment.  DOD customers requiring cargo transport will load/band cargo on the AIP.  The AIP will be delivered to the aerial port.  Then the AIP will be loaded and “netted” on the 463L Pallet for transport throughout the military airlift system which includes cargo loaders, forklifts, and conveyor systems.  The cargo carrying equipment includes the C-130, C-5, and C-17 aircraft, flat bed trailers, and intermodal containers.

It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

2.  Amend Specification (h) to change the STANAG 4055 reference to STANAG 5066.

3.  Amend Specification (m) to add the following:

The antenna coupler must be capable of providing an efficient transmission line antenna impedance match over the entire frequency spectrum from as low as 2.0 MHz and as high as 29.999 MHz. The following are typical of some of the impedances the coupler must be able to efficiently match:
 
02.00 MHz = .4 + J52.4
10.40 MHz = 9750 + J2080
10.54 MHz = 5270 - J4520
29.999 MHz = 78 + J78.5
 
The antenna coupler must also be able to deliver adequate power to the antenna such that the ratio of the radiated power to the power delivered to the coupler should not be less than 15% as determined from the following equation:
  
Ia2xR / Pc  =   Þ
  	  
Where Ia = antenna current as measured by a thermocouple ammeter.
R = “real” part of the antenna impedance
Pc= Power delivered to antenna coupler.
Þ = Efficiency in percent, must be > 15% at the frequency with the lowest efficiency.


4.  Delete FAR Clause 52.225-1.

5.  Offerors shall be required to propose on ALL or NONE of the CLIN Items.

The NAIC code is changed to “493190” “OTHER WAREHOUSING AND STORAGE”.  Additionally, the services to be provided is for Navy DEPMEDS that are either designed and packed to be deployed in configurations or platforms, which meet the individual requirements of each mission, or designed, packed, and pre-positioned for deployment as a specific configuration in anticipation of future missions.  In each case, items comprising DEPMEDS are categorized and packed into groups or assemblages designed to provide a specific functional capability (i.e. pharmacy, laboratory, surgery, radiology, intensive care wards, dental, power generation, power distribution, potable water, wastewater collection and storage, laundry, staff housing, galley, public works, etc.).  These functional area assemblages are called authorized medical allowance lists (AMAL) or authorized dental allowance lists (ADAL) and are the building blocks used by FHSO staff to create DEPMEDS configurations in the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) computer network system.   These configurations typically range from 10 to 500-bed systems but can be as small as an individual AMAL /ADAL assemblage or greater than, the 500-bed system, depending on the mission (up to 2500 different configuration).  The basic concept is worldwide “just-in-time” delivery for any potential need or mission.  The solicitation will be issued on or before 11 Jul 2005.

<DESC>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:

The SBA requires contractors to develop and support initiatives proposed by American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians and non-profit organizations for economic development projects on disadvantaged and underserved Indian reservations and tribal areas that will empower Native American entrepreneurs in accordance with the attached statement of work.


Office of Native American Affairs
Native American Economic Development Projects

Statement of Work

Background

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), through its Office of Native American Affairs (ONAA), is continuing the Native American initiative begun in FY 2003 that will provide economic development services to small businesses.  SBA will work closely with American Indians, Native Alaskans, Native Hawaiians, tribal governments, tribal colleges, Indian organizations, and other Federal agencies, as well as the private sector, to supplement and support the Indian nations’ plan for economic stimulus.  

Scope

The SBA/ONAA will support economic development projects that represent the interests of American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians.

1.  The projects must have the ability to meet the objective of providing increased entrepreneurial development opportunities for American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians

2.  The projects must have the potential to become “best practices” for implementation by other entities around the country.

3.  Each project must specify the targets/ milestones, and deliverables to be met to ensure completion of agreed-upon targets, goals, and outcomes.

4.  The projects must include viable plans for identifying alternate funding options so that successful projects can continue without further SBA funds.

5. Examples of some of the economic development projects SBA contemplates include but are      not limited to the following:

•	Establishing cooperatives to allow American Indian, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian small business owners to obtain economies of scale, including better pricing for equipment, supplies and services (e.g., accounting, insurance, employee benefits, payroll services, etc.), more efficient inventory systems and distribution networks and shared marketing, etc.
•	Setting up peer roundtables (taking advantage of teleconferencing or other electronic tools when feasible) to share information, experiences and best practices, to problem-solve, and to provide outside expert consultation.
•	Developing and implementing strategies to increase Internet access for individuals residing on remote locations such as tribal lands and rural areas (e.g. assisting Indian tribes to establish Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies.)
•	Developing and supporting non-traditional business structures (such as home-based businesses, agribusinesses, aqua-farming, folk art, etc.) and niche markets including exporting, e-commerce, trade and tourism, etc.
•	Establishing local resource centers to provide American Indians, Native Alaskans and Native Hawaiians entrepreneur’s access to the most current resources available, including the necessary hardware and software to access information online.
•	Developing and implementing quality training, counseling and access to resources to specialized target groups such as Youth Entrepreneurs, Veterans, active Military and Reservist. 

6.  Deliverable products could include activities such as:

•	Business Training Programs					
•	Brochures								
•	Website Development						
•	Business counseling						


7.  The contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities to perform the tasks listed in this Statement of Work.

8.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all personnel working on this project have adequate training to perform their assigned tasks.  Any courses or other training needed to ensure that staff skills are commensurate with the work to be performed are the responsibility of the Contractor and shall be undertaken at no direct cost to this contract.

9. A construction project is permissible if it meets all of the criteria in the RFP/statement of work, and if it falls within the total budgeted amount.


Place of Performance

Work may be performed at the contractor’s offices or on site as necessary.  Proposals must state where work will be performed.

Period of Performance

The period of performance is one year from date of award.

Government Furnished Items

The government will not furnish items outside the scope of the contract unless otherwise provided for in this Statement of Work. 



Reporting

By the 15th of each month the contractor is expected to submit monthly activity reports to the SBA Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) on progress against targets/milestones, and include any recommendations regarding performance/deliverables to demonstrate proper monitoring of project performance and completion of agreed-upon targets, goals, and outcomes.  Any schedule adjustments will be agreed-upon between the contractor and SBA management, and the implementation strategy will be modified accordingly.  A standardized monthly reporting template will be provided by SBA/ONAA or information requirements for monthly reporting will be provided by SBA/ONAA.

Contractor is required to report client activity data and provide copies of intake forms associated with all services provided to clients on behalf of the SBA in the Entrepreneur Development Management Information System (EDMIS).  The SBA will provide the contractor with EDMIS training and access.

Invoices

By the 15th of each month the contractor is to submit an invoice to the SBA COTR, covering all services rendered during the preceding monthly time period with sufficient detail to clearly explain all services provided and the corresponding portion of the total price incurred under this contract.  The invoices are to clearly match against the agreed-upon contract terms, and maintain an accounting of cumulative charges and available balances.


Funding

SBA will not approve for funding any contract that includes any provisions requiring the clients to be served to pay for any related services, or to make payments to the contractor based on the success of the ventures assisted.

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has conceived of a device to convert thermal energy (heat) directly to electricity.  This device may operate using a working fluid or may be based on mechanical motion.  It uses heat transfer to create cyclic motion and the same motion is then the driver of electromotive potential.  Consequently, it approaches solid state in simplicity and reliability.  The heat may come from such sources as chemical reactions, the sun, fission, fuel, or radioactive decay.  This device could power everything from personal computers to satellites. It is not expected to power commercial power grids.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology.  It is anticipated that commercialization will be carried out by licensing this technology to a company.  Additional development and support may be possible through Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with some or all of the funding support being provided by the participant(s).  The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and implementing this technology into an operation.  Interested parties should respond on or before July 29, 2005.  For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Ida Shum:

<DESC>Solicitation for Expressions of Interest
Geodetic Surveys to Support Height Modernization in Mississippi

The Mississippi Height Modernization Program (MHMP) is seeking to identify qualified firms to perform geodetic survey work under a federally-funded grant.  The MHMP plans to enter into agreements with two prime consultants to perform both first-order leveling surveys and GPS surveys according to National Geodetic Survey (NGS) standards, specifications, and guidelines.  All projects completed under this program will be submitted to NGS for inclusion in the National Spatial Reference System database.  Selected firms may be required to perform any or all phases of field observations, data reduction, preparation and submission to NGS for leveling and GPS surveys.  Surveys performed under this project will be conducted generally along the US 90 corridor between approximately Pensacola, Florida, and Pearlington, Mississippi, and in adjacent areas.  As a general scope, we anticipate that the total project may include approximately 400 km of leveling and multiple occupations on 50 GPS points.  The MHMP presently plans to begin the field work on this project during October of 2005.

Firms interested in being considered for selection as one of the prime consultants must submit their complete qualifications to the MHMP by the stated due date.  Expressions of interest will include a completed federal SF 330 (obsolete forms are not acceptable) documenting the firm’s qualifications and experience to perform all aspects of both types of geodetic surveys cited above.  Include as a separate attachment a list of all projects, including accession numbers, previously accepted by NGS, and provide copies of letters received from NGS indicating successful acceptance of leveling and GPS projects previously submitted.  Expressions of interest should include enough additional information, in sufficient detail, for MHMP to judge the firm’s qualifications on each of the criteria listed below.  Be concise, clear, and direct in all submitted material; the thickest book is not always the most interesting one.

The MHMP strongly encourages each firm that submits expressions of interest to included one or more small businesses (as defined under federal procurement guidelines) as sub-consultants on their team.  The MHMP’s goal in this regard is to encourage capacity building among small businesses to accomplish these types of geodetic surveys.  Primes must identify any proposed small business sub-consultant firms in their expressions of interest.  Proposed sub-consultants need not meet all of the qualification requirements; they need only be established surveying firms based in Mississippi with experience in leveling and/or GPS surveys.  It is up to the prime firm to adequately document these qualifications in an attachment to their submission.  Qualifications of any proposed sub-consultant(s), relative to the selection criteria, will strengthen the overall qualifications of the consultant team.

Two prime consultants will be selected on the basis of these criteria:
1.	Demonstrated successful completion and submission of geodetic leveling and GPS survey projects according to NGS standards and specifications;
2.	General experience with geodetic leveling and GPS geodetic survey projects;
3.	Possession of suitable experienced staff and sufficient material resources needed to accomplish these types of surveys;
4.	Geographic proximity to, and familiarity with, the project area;
5.	Extent of proposed inclusion of small-firm sub-consultant(s) in roles designed to build their capacity and qualifications to perform this type work in the future;
6.	Record of conducting safe surveying operations in this environment.

Expressions of interest for selection as a prime consultant on this project must be submitted to the Administrator, Mississippi Height Modernization Program, Gulf Coast Geospatial Center, P.O. Box 7000, Ocean Springs, MS, 39566-7000.  All proposals must be received by C.O.B. on August 1st, 2005.  Submit one hard-copy of your expression of interest and two digital copies on CD-ROM, in either PDF or Word document format.  Clearly identify the point of contact within the firm for this project.  

The MHMP is in no way obligated by this solicitation to ultimately enter into agreements with any of the proposing firms.  Nothing in this request for expressions of interest may be construed or interpreted as a promise or contract as to how work on this project, conducted under subsequent agreements, will be assigned or apportioned to the selected prime firms.  The final selection of consultant teams to be offered agreements under this project will be made by the MHMP Administrator.

<DESC>The Federal Occupational Health Service is seeking entry level personnel(s) to assist in collecting data for a research project involving highway and street construction workers being conducted out of Morgantown, WV.  This multi-disciplinary project  will involve data collection, proximity warning systems evaluation, set up of GPS receivers on all pieces of construction equipment,  and video recording. Work in hot environments are expected.  Field work is typically scheduled for 10 contiguous days, including weekends. Work days typically begin at 4 or 5 am, and extend up to 12 hours.  Sundays are always limited to 8 hours, and other work days may be limited to 8 hours as a result of unanticipated changes in scheduled paving work and/or weather.     

Daily set up and take down activities are extensive.  Before paving crews arrive at the work site, Field crews install GPS receivers on all pieces of construction equipment, prepare GPS receivers to be worn by workers, and set up a research trailer for video reception.  Additional GPS receivers are prepared for asphalt delivery truck drivers.  These are sometimes installed at the construction site; at other times, part of the crew travels to the asphalt plant to install receivers on trucks and to give drivers their receivers.  On study sites where data are being collected on proximity warning systems, field crews spend additional time setting up data loggers and video recorders on asphalt trucks.  Once data collection begins, one person regulates all data collection activities, two record observations of worker exposures, one records site and paving operation data, two record video footage, and one provides relief for observers and videographers throughout the day.  At the end of each day, data are verified and filed, additional site and operation data are recorded, the research trailer is broken down, and GPS receivers and other equipment are retrieved from all construction personnel and equipment.

Field work is currently scheduled through early October at sites in Indianapolis, IN; Beckley, WV; and Parkersburg, WV.   Plans are to schedule additional field work throughout Fiscal Year 2006.  

Necessary Training:  
As a minimum, a BS degree in the following disciplines are required: industrial hygiene, public health, occupational health, environmental science, technical research, engineering, occupational safety, and  social sciences or administration.
  
Qualified individuals should submit their resume to Federal Occupational Health, Attn:     Michelle Stemmons, Suite 714, 536 S. Clark Street, Chicago, IL 60605.     Or by email to:     mstemmons@psc.gov.     All resumes will receive equal consideration without regard to race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, political affiliation, age, or any other factor not related to the evaluation process.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice:

The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards Air Force Base, CA is seeking potential sources capable of providing a Hypermod MMT28 S-Band and L-Band transmitters.  The purpose of this device is to transmit weapon test data. The following is the description of the unit:

§	Capable of transmitting multiple Advanced Range Telemetry waveforms: ARTM Tier II (Multi-h CPM), Tier I (SOQPSK), & Tier 0 (PCM/FM)
§	Available in 6 and14 cubic inch packages
§	3x data capacity versus legacy transmitters – up to 27.8 Mbps
§	Spectral mask meets or exceeds IRIG 106-04 telemetry standards

The Hypermod Transmitter is the only device capable of transmitting all three Advanced Range Telemetry (ARTM) waveforms including the spectrally efficient Tier II and Tier I modulation schemes.  Combined with Hypermod demodulators, this new flight test telemetry system allows more efficient spectrum usage, higher data rates and a greater communication range.

Hypermod MMT28 multi-mode airborne telemetry transmitter is distinctive in its ability to take full advantage of the spectrally efficient ARTM Tier I (SOQPSK) and ARTM Tier II (Multi-h CPM) waveforms, as well as the widely used ARTM Tier 0 (PCM/FM or CPFSK) waveform.  Hypermod with this ARTM Tier I waveform has been proven to effectively use only one-half of the channel bandwidth of the Tier 0 waveform and supports data rates up to 27.8 Mbps.

Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide Hypermod MMT28 S-Band and L-Band transmitters.

Firms responding to this synopsis must identify their company’s capabilities to perform the requirements described herein, reference the synopsis number and indicate whether or not that they are a small or small disadvantaged business concern as defined in FAR 52.219-1.  The NAICS code is 334220.  The Small Business size standard is 750 employees.  

The information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought synopsis.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded in July 2005.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) desires the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from SOF aviation platforms.  USSOCOM intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to qualify a multi-purpose warhead that is effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships. (1) Penetration: When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead will function after penetrating 24 inches of reinforced concrete and  four feet of timber/earthen bunkers at typical engagement ranges. (2) Non-Developmental / In Service Status:  The multi-purpose warhead must be non-developmental and qualified by other allied (NATO) countries.     (3) Mass/CG Flight Characteristics:  When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M229/M151 warhead to insure  minimum need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (precision kill weapon system).  (4) Incendiary Effect:  The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact. (5) Training Warhead: It is desired that the vendor provide an inert day/night warhead (to replace the M274) warhead that provides a visible hit signature. The new warhead should minimize UXO hazards. When deployed overseas, the new warhead should allow SOF forces to conduct training on allied ranges without creating UXO hazards or creating in-advertent range fires. (6) Facilities, Expertise and Safety: These warheads should meet stringent Navy WSESRB requirements /standards. The warheads should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (IM characteristics) and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. ** Responses to this market survey are due on or before 01 Aug 2005 and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than  01 Aug 2005. Questions may be submitted in writing to CW5 Bob Fairhurst at the above address or via email to fairhur@socom.mil. Interested Parties who are willing to provide qualified warheads at no cost for USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper. No further information is available from the contracting office.

<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought is to identify potential sources capable of manufacturing Light Weight (LW) 30MM M789 HEDP cartridge, NSN 1305-01-268-9373, Part No. 12902728. Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges. The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal parts, (2) production of propellant, (3) cartridge case priming and loading w/propellant and (4)  load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment are required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Experience in ballistic  testing, expertise in the formulation and production of propellant, and process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistics test range, M230 MANN barrels and M230 Automatic Gun are required to perfo rm First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate system s, ultrasonic test equipment and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.   Production of the cartridge is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition process/design engineers, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunit ion component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control engineers, ultra sonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test personnel, etc) needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the cust omers demand for timely deliveries, the producers must be able to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test within 120 days after award, with the first production delivery due within 180 days after award.  A respondents production cap acity must be sufficient to manufacture an average of 100,000 per month. The technical Data Package (TDP) associated with the LW30mm M789 HEDP cartridge is coded Distribution X, which means distribution is authorized to U.S. Government agencies and private individuals or enterprises eligible to obtain export-controlled technica l data in accordance with regulations implementing 10 USC 140C.  To receive the TDP, all interested contractors must have a current approved DD Form 2345 on file at the defense logistics service center HTTP://www.dlis.mil/jcp/.   Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing the M789 cartridge are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companys capabilities, facilities, personnel and past manufacturing ex perience to: HQ, AFSC, ATTN: AMSFS-CCA-F/Amy VanSickle, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, IL  61299-6500.

The preferred approach will utilize vapor compression technology, however other novel approaches will be considered. The system shall also integrate with current SCBA systems in use by the military EOD user community to include various field protective masks.  The cooling system may serve as a complete replacement of the  currently available Med-Eng BCS-3 Cooling System to include the Tube Suit with Cooling Bottle.  Alternatively, the microclimate cooling system could be a replacement for the Cooling Bottle alone and integrate with the Med-Eng BCS-3.  It is envisioned that  the microclimate cooling system will provide a cooling capacity of approximately 250 Watts at 100deg F ambient temperature.  The system power source shall be 24-volt, powered by commercially available batteries or a rechargeable battery pack.  The batteri es shall be capable of being easily replaced in a field environment and provide a minimum operating time of 1 hour.  Additionally, the system shall weigh less than 12 pounds (cooling system, including garment). The cooling suit with cooling fluid shall wei gh less than 4 pounds and be available in a variety of standard sizes.  The suit shall be lightweight for extended wear and machine washable.  Firms which have products that meet the above characteristics/capabilities are invited to submit the following in formation within their Capability Statement: 1) Product summary, 2) Complete detailed technical characteristics and specifications (including but not limited to the parameters mentioned above), Pictures/drawings of system, 4) Unit price and delivery (based  upon individual unit quantities).  Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements.  Vendors are requested to submit their Capability Statement to the address below no later than 20 July 2005. It is requested that no Capability Statement be sent via e-mail.  This sources sought/Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acqu ire any product.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement of a payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of s ubmission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the n on-restricted/non-proprietary information.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  Responses to the RFI shall be mailed to the following address:  US Army RDECOM Acquisition Center, ATTN:  AMSRD-ACC-A/Paula Kestler, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdee n Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.

<DESC>U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) has submitted a Request for Information (RFI) regarding information technologies that can be applied against the development of a global visibility capability as described below.  This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201 (c).  The intent of the RFI is to identify market interest and to solicit recommendations regarding the best way to produce the desired global visibility capability.   

This is neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor can there be any claims levied against the Government as a result of any information submitted by respondents.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Potential uses for the information received may include development of requirements packages and possible future solicitations, but knowledge of this cannot be construed in any way as a commitment by the government.

The Joint Staff J8 (JS J8) and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Personnel and Readiness (OSD-P&R) are co-leading a Functional Solutions Analysis for development of a Global Visibility Capability in support of USJFCOM as the primary conventional Joint Force Provider.  The JFCOM J3/4 will be the primary customer for development of this capability.  Accordingly, JFCOM is advertising this Request for Information (RFI) to all organizations, as part of its search for mature technologies that can provide either a single information technology tool or an integrated suite of tools that will meet the capability objectives listed in the Use Cases below.  

The Global Visibility capability is a critical enabler for JFCOM in its role as the conventional Joint Force Provider.  JFCOM is pursuing a number of available options for the development of this capability.  The results of our review of the responses to the RFI and the results of the JS J8 Functional Solutions Analysis will be briefed to the Force Management Functional Capabilities Board in the Fall of 2005, and will be used in the continuation of the effort to develop the a global visibility capability.  

This Market Research and RFI is for planning only, and shall not be considered an RFP or IFB, an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services, or authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  The USG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds the USG to pursue any course of action described herein.  If the USG chooses to issue an RFP at some future date, another notice will be published.

Global Visibility Capability High Level Objectives

The following Use Cases, when taken as a whole, describe the desired capability.  The following Condition and Objective apply universally to all the Use Cases listed:

Universal Condition:  A SIPRNET and NIPRNET net-centric accessible application which accesses authoritative Joint, Service, and Agency data representing capabilities within Department of Defense (DOD) force structure regardless of classification.  Authoritative data sources and force structure shall be tailorable and dynamic to allow for evolutionary changes.

Universal Objective:  Retrieve/input query results and export/import data into application in compliance with joint system of record (GCCS-J, JC2, other?) application standards (> 95% accuracy). 

Use Case A – Force Structure

Task: Provide comprehensive inventory of DOD force structure that represents capabilities required to meet emergent and rotational requirements.

·	For Combat Support/Combat Service Support (CS/CSS) Forces, this breakdown shall be down to the smallest “deployable entity” (e.g., teams, dets, platoons, squads, troops, companies, elements, etc.); possibly down to the MOS/individual.  Requires comprehensive analysis of all RFF’s/RFC’s generated since OIF build up to identify required levels of reporting/visibility. (Note: This analysis is currently underway; status of effort will be briefed at information exchange day.)

·	For aggregation/ “rollup” of capabilities (CSG’s, BDE’s etc.), GVT shall account for each individual units/ “deployable entities” as they are tailored over time to meet requirements of requested aggregated/”rollup” capability.
  
·	Standard:  Provide JFP visibility of DOD Force/capabilities inventory.  Required to establish  units/“deployable entities” baseline to draw from to meet the requested force/capability.  Forces For layout is insufficient to meet JFP requirements.  
·	Objective: Be able to identify and track (1) all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of this Use Case and (2) all ad hoc “deployable entities” which are task organized to meet emergent mission requirements (examples are ETTs, ASTs, etc.).
  
Use Case B – Force Capabilities Identifier

Task:  Identify units/“deployable entities of units” (by name, UIC or other designator) that equate to the requested force or capability (RFF/RFC for contingency operations) and rotational requirements (for ongoing operations, e.g. OIF/OEF/SFOR, etc) and requirements to source contingency plan TPFDDs (OPLAN/CONPLAN/FUNCPLAN).  
Standard:  Provide JFP a preliminary list of candidate units/“deployable entities” to meet the requested force/capability.  This list of units/“deployable entities” shall represent the entire joint sourcing solution set for meeting each RCC requirement. 
Objective: Be able to identify (1) all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of the Force Structure Use Case and (2) any ad hoc force structure by capability.

Use Case C – Force Readiness

Task: Provide measured readiness (current/project OPTES: Overall, Personnel, Training, Equipment, Supplies) at the appropriate level of reporting for the required capability/force across the joint sourcing solution set in common language/standards of measurement (C-rating, R-Y-G, other?).  
Standard:  Provide JFP the visibility of measured readiness for candidate units/ “deployable entities” to meet the requested force/capability.  Readiness shall include traditional OPTES resource data as well as mission unique data requirements for units/“deployable entities” to meet each RCC requirement. 
Objective: Be able to identify current readiness levels as reported by the “unit” commander within one day of status change against (1) all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of the Force Structure Use Case by capability and (2) ad hoc force structure.

Use Case D – Global Force Management Strategic Guidance
 
Task:  Identify red-line violations/considerations for candidate units/“deployable entities” IAW accepted GFM Strategic Guidance.  Red-line considerations include (at a minimum): Mob history (Mobilizations, Demobilizations, Extensions, Re-mob, Mob Authority), Dwell, Transformation, Ops/Pers Tempo, Readiness (minimum standards for deployment), AC/RC/NG specific guidance and any others identified by OSD, Joint Staff or Services in the future.  
Standard:  Provide JFP the strategic guidance required to prioritize/eliminate candidate units/“deployable entities” to meet the requested force/capability.  Strategic guidance shall be dynamic and shall be updated by OSD, JS, and Services (as required) to ensure JFP visibility of recognized red-lines when recommending sourcing solutions to meet each RCC requirement. 
Objective: Incorporates all strategic guidance by OSD, Joint Staff and Services required to prioritize (1) all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of the Force Structure Use Case and (2) all ad hoc force structure elements.

Use Case E – Force Availability

Task: Provide comprehensive and tailorable (by filter) overview (current, historic and future) of force availability for each of the candidate units/“deployable entities” identified.  Required visibility includes (but is not limited to): deployments (operational, exercise, and experiments)/redeployments, PTDOs, Mobilization/Demobilization, Reconstitution/ Reset, Maintenance (include C-5 designations), Transformation, JSCP apportionment, COCOM assignment, OPCON/ADCON relationships, planned rotations (AEFPP, JPP, GNFPP, SSN global allocation, ISR allocation, other?), and Service identified considerations (“wildcard” entry for Service comments).  
Standard:  Provide JFP the overview of units/“deployable entities” employment over time and is required to prioritize/eliminate candidate units/“deployable entities” to meet the requested force/capability.  Force Availability data shall be dynamic and shall be updated (as required) by OSD, JS, COCOMs and Services to ensure JFP visibility of recognized red-lines/ considerations when recommending sourcing solutions to meet each RCC requirement. 
Objective: Provide historic (six year past), current, and future (six year forward) force availability for all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of the Force Structure Use Case.

Use Case F – Force Location

Task:  Provide integrated location information for each of the candidate units/“deployable entities” identified.  Required location visibility (historic, current, future) includes but is not limited to CONUS (major city/state) and Intra- /Inter-Theater (major city/nation) movements for each of the candidate units/“deployable entities”.  
Standard:  Provide JFP visibility required to prioritize/eliminate candidate units/“deployable entities” to meet the requested force/capability and to track units/ “deployable entities throughout the pre-deployment (mobilization if required), deployment, redeployment and reconstitution cycle.  Location information may be determining factor in transportation analysis in selecting one candidate over another or be used to confirm previous deployments/force availability considerations (e.g. BOG) for individual candidates (i.e. “who can get there first?”).  
Objective:  Provide historic (six year), current, and future (three year) force locations for all DOD force structure elements (down to the smallest “deployable entities” level) as defined in the “task” section of the Force Structure Use Case.   Provide historic, current, and future force locations for ad hoc force structure elements as they are identified.
  
Use Case G – Force Apportionment

Task: Identify units/“deployable entities of units” (by name, UIC or other designator) apportionment to COCOM plan requirements (OPLAN, CONPLAN, FUNCPLAN).   Standard:  Provide JFP visibility required to identify units/“deployable entities” aligned to a given COCOM plan and their readiness/status/availability to meet requirements.  In addition, require JFP to identify a substitute force/capability candidate if the apportioned unit/“deployable entity” is selected by JFP to meet other requirements or is otherwise engaged.  Include capability to identify units to fill TPFDD plan requirements, flag dual/multiple taskings (identify conflicts) and find substitutes when conflicts exist.
Objective: Be able to accurately track and report on the current apportionment process.

Task:  Provide integrated common operating picture (COP) which has tailorable, exportable graphics and reports.  Display features of COP shall be tailorable to display ad hoc and routine queries for requested force information but at a minimum allow the JFP to display/obtain information on the status and location of deploying, deployed and redeploying forces.  The reporting module of COP shall provide user defined and standard reports in both textual and graphical presentations.  
Standard:   COP must provide on demand and routine reporting capability to support the JFP requirement to supervise deployment of forces to meet UCP04 tasking.  
Objective: Retrieve/input query results and export/import data into application in compliance with joint system of record (GCCS-J, JC2, other?) application standards (> 95% accuracy).

Use Case I – Work In Progress

Task:  Save work-in-progress at end of day or in order to work another RFF/RFC or open previously saved work-in-progress and continue working.  
Standard:  Provide ability to: save work-in-progress (working set of forces being considered for a complete or partial RFF/RFC); load saved work-in-progress and update qualifications of forces (readiness, etc.); identify saved works-in-progress associated with a complete or partial RFF/RFC; and transfer a saved work-in-progress to another analyst at the JFP location.  
Objective: Save work-in-progress in < 5 seconds; number of works-in-progress should be limited only by available storage capacity which must be expandable

<DESC>The VA Network 22 Logistics Office, Long Beach, California intends to negotiate a sole source interim contract with Loma Linda University Health Care (LLUHC) - an affiliate; on behalf of VA Loma Linda Healthcare System (VALLHS)for emergent cardiac services to be perform at LLUHC.  The anticipated interim contract will be for a six (6) month period.  During the interim period, a solicitation will be issue for competitive bid to provide the same services (emergent cardiac surgery).  The procurement is being conducted under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), FAR Part 6.302-2: The Authority applies under unusual and compelling urgency condition.  Also, 41 U.S.C. 8153, Public Law 104-262, and 38 U.S.C. 8153 are applicable.  5.  VA Loma Linda Healthcare System does not provide cardiac surgery services, and does not have the facilities, infrastructure, or staff to perform such surgery.  Non-emergent cardiac surgery patients are referred to either VA San Diego Healthcare System or to VA Greater Las Angeles Healthcare System.  Both facilities are located too far from VALLHS to provide emergent services.  LLUHC is an affiliate, located near VALLHS, and have an excellent cardiac surgery team.  VALLHS has been referring selective cases (most complex and urgent) to LLUHC in time of emergency.  Accordingly, LLUHC is being utilized without competition for the interim contract period to maintain continuity of care while a long-term contract for emergent cardiac surgery can be competed and put in place. It is determined to be in the best interest of the government and the delivery of patient care.

Factor 1:  Technical Capability.  Factor 2:  Past Performance.  Factor 3:  Demonstration of Software Capability.  Technical Evaluation Factors (taken in their entirety) are more important than price; however, between proposals that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful offeror.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

There are no weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Good, Substantial response to each of the areas.    Vendor’s product meets mandatory requirements described above.  There are no significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.    Average:  Vendor’s proposal is responsive to requirements. It may be weak in substantiation of information or data presented.  There may be one or more significant weaknesses and no deficiencies.  Poor: A proposal may receive a rating of Poor for any of the following reasons:  Displays only a limited capability to meet requirements; lacks essential information to substantiate claims/data presented; or proposal omits required and pertinent information in major areas.  Technical Factor 2:  Past Performance.  The Offeror must provide a Project Profile for at least 3 projects.  Each Project Profile must represent work completed within the past 24 months.

All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates no risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Good:  All survey responses were positive with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction.  Any concerns were minimal or isolated and were satisfactorily addressed by the vendor (in follow-up).  All references have and/or would return to vendor to satisfy future requirements based on positive experience.  The vendor’s past performance history demonstrates very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality products, on time, or any degradation of performance or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable).  Neutral:  No Prior Past Performance.  Average:  At least two of the three survey responses were marginal or unsatisfactory with regard to on-time and accurate delivery, cost control, responsiveness to customers and commitment to customer satisfaction, and/or overall performance.  The offeror experienced periodic problems and/or was not consistently proactive in addressing issues or concerns.  Some references not as likely to return to the vendor to satisfy future requirements.  Some potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation or lack of customer satisfaction (or cost growth if applicable) based on the Offeror’s past performance.  Poor:  The Offeror’s past experiences are extremely weak, and/or inaccurate, and/or incomplete.  There is insufficient evidence to show that the contractor could perform the requirements of the SOW.  There are significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Factor 3:  The Government shall require a Demonstration of Software Capability from the most highly qualified vendors.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

STATEMENT OF WORK

The Defense Logistics Agency, DLA Training Center, Workforce Development Division, Leadership & Management Development Team, requires Contractor support for the development and delivery of a training course for non-supervisors entitled, “Is Supervision for Me?”

Project Description


A.	Background:
DLA established the Enterprise Leader Development Program (ELDP) in November 2003 based on the principle that everyone can be a leader.  It is a comprehensive program designed around the DLA leadership competency framework and provides avenues of development for leaders at all levels of the organization.  It also promotes competence in DLA’s potential leaders, those who have yet to be placed in leadership roles or supervisory positions, but who will carry the torch into tomorrow.  

There are five tiers to the ELDP, each designed for a particular segment of the DLA employee base as follows:

•	Tier I – Non-supervisory employees and Team Leaders
•	Tier II – New supervisors in their probationary period
•	Tier III – 1st line supervisors with 2-10 years of experience
•	Tier IV – 1st line supervisors with more than 10 years of experience and managers (supervisors of supervisors)
•	Tier V – Supervisors of managers and Senior Executive Service members

B.	Purpose/Objective:

Tier I of the ELDP is intended to guide non-supervisors in developing leadership skills; and, to assist them in determining if a career change to supervision would fit their interests and capabilities.  This course will provide insights as to the rewards and challenges of supervision and introduce students to the DLA Managerial competencies and how those translate into supervisor duties, responsibilities, and qualities.  

This course is not intended to build leadership skills, but to serve as a decision-making vehicle with the goal of determining if a position in supervision would be a good fit.

C.	Course Instructors:

Training will be delivered through one or more instructors who present for all DLA course sessions so as to ensure familiarity with agency climate/culture and facilitate consistency of content/presentation.  Contractor shall make instructor recommendations to the Government, with the Government having final say as to which instructors will teach the course.  In cases of unanticipated emergencies, substitution of instructors may be recommended, with prior advance notice to and final approval by the Government.  Resumes for potential instructors will be submitted to the Government for review along with the Contractor’s proposal.  Contract instructors must be expert facilitators with:

•	Substantial experience as a supervisor or manager, preferably in the DoD
•	Substantial experience working with DoD organizations
•	Experience in teaching leadership principles (communication, teambuilding, group development, conflict management, etc), to establish the link between knowledge and application, and
•	Have instructed a similar course within the past year.

D.	Content Requirements:

Training will be conducted in one (1) day with seven hours of instruction.  Course hours will include a one-hour lunch break and at least three 10-minutes breaks as needed.  Suggested course hours are 8:00-4:30, although the start and end times may vary if pre-arranged based on the needs of the student population.

Topics/Activities for Presentation

•	Foundation skills of supervisory leadership
•	Student self-assessment (provided by Contractor) of competence in supervisory skills mapped to the DLA Managerial Competencies (definitions and Competency Framework provided by DLA)
•	The roles and responsibilities of being a supervisor
•	The rewards and challenges of supervision (current DLA supervisor input will be provided)
•	What current DLA supervisors wish they would have known before becoming a supervisor (current DLA supervisor input will be provided)
•	Examples of realistic supervisor-employee interactions with opportunities for students to test their responses
•	Definition of leadership versus management (provided by DLA)
•	Qualities of good supervisors
•	What subordinates want from a supervisor
•	How a person’s work relationships change when becoming a supervisor
•	Discussion of future supervisory challenges under the National Security Personnel System (NSPS)
•	Planning for competency development using the ELDP Tier I Guide (Guide to be provided)

Travel Costs  -  Travel costs will be reimbursed in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation.

Training Methodology – The students will explore how the Managerial Competencies are applied in the day-to-day supervision of federal civilian employees and military service members.  The learning experience will be enhanced through hands-on and group activities throughout the course and may be supplemented by video presentations.  The final activity will involve the development of an action plan using the ELDP Tier I Guide.

Level of Performance – The Contractor shall ensure training materials measure student capabilities through structured instruction, individual and/or team exercises, active class participation, case studies, and simulations.  A Government-developed evaluation form will be completed by all students at the end of each session and provided to the Government POC within 15 calendar days after the last day of each session.  Contractor shall recommend training approach and techniques based upon DLA requirements; however, DLA will have final approval on all recommendations.
