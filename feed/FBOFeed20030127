<DESC>The Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility (ERDF) is a large CERCLA disposal facility that receives radioactive and chemically contaminated wastes from the Hanford Site.  The facility currently consists of 4 disposal cells and will be expanded by this project to 6 cells.  Each cell is approximately 500 ft by 500 ft at the base and 70 ft deep.  At the surface each pair of cells is approximately 710 ft by 1420 ft.  In addition to the currently operational cells, one half of cells 5 and 6 have already been excavated.  This construction project will complete the excavation of cells 5 and 6, install a double liner, double leachate collection system and excavate one half of cells 7 and 8. Some ancillary site work will also be included in this project.

The leachate collection system includes construction of one crest pad building for each cell housing a piping manifold and electrical controls and instrumentation cell?s 3 submersible pumps (a total of 6 submersible pumps).  Also included is the piping between the manifolds and sumps at the bottom of the cells, extension of double lined piping from the new crest pad buildings to the existing leachate collection system, and extension of existing electrical power and signal wires to the new crest pad buildings.  

Earthwork will consist of approximately 1.5 million bank cubic yards (bcy) of soil, most of which will be placed in a nearby stockpile.  Approximately 140,000 bcy of the excavated soil will be compacted at the edge of the excavation to form embankments for the new cells.  An admix of higher-silt-content excavated soils and imported bentonite will be mixed in a pugmill and will be placed in the bottom and on the side walls of the two new cells.  The volume of the admix is approximately 75,000 bcy.  A 3 ft thick operations layer of excavated soil will be placed on top of the completed liner system.

The liner system will consist of the admix layer, two one ft thick gravel drainage layers, and two high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liners with associated geotextile and geomembrane layers.  The primary and secondary liners each require approximately 86,000 square yards of 60 mil HDPE.  The liner system will be built to be RCRA compliant.

Ancillary site work will include addition of yard lighting and piping in the nearby waste transportation container queue area.

Subcontract value is estimated to be between $9 million and $11 million.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for a modification to an existing NASA LaRC owned Acoustic Measurement System. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from	Virginia Commonwealth University who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency Requirements.	Virginia Commonwealth University developed the original acoustic measurement system under a previous purchase order.  The system will be modified to develop digital portion of small size, lightweight, and power efficient Clear Air Turbulence (CAT) detection system.  This system will be used to develop an infrared array to (1) detect and locate clear air turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere and (2) integrate into a network to locate and track CAT and severe storms.	It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to generate the data necessary to recreate this system and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 10, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not	acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for renewal of the annual service maintenance contract on Government owned chromatographs and accessories.  Maintenance shall include routine inspection and replacement, when necessary, of parts; travel and labor.  This chromatographic equipment is used to purify, quantify, and characterize the molecular weights of aerospace polymeric materials.  This purchase will include a one year with two additional option years of performance. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from  Waters Corporation, who is the only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy Agency requirements.  This procurement is for a continuation of current maintenance contract on this equipment.  The equipment was manufactured by Waters Corporation and service is available only through the manufacturer.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to generate the supplies and services and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 12, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The technology is a versatile, non-invasive, on-line, and accurate method and apparatus for measuring the viscosity and other physical properties of liquids and slurries flowing in pipes or other conduits.  The technology is based on combined spatially-resolved ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry and sophisticated local speed-of-sound measurements.  The technology is ideally suited for the food processing, consumer products, and polymer industries where process fluids or products with complex physical properties (e.g., those that determine texture and consistency) need to be measured or monitored in real time for quality control.  The technology helps take the guesswork out of quality-related issues and supplants labor-intensive sampling procedures.  It provides desirable performance features in terms of automation, resolution, penetration, and speed.  The device meets plant operating requirements for physical size and robustness by integrating advanced sensors, miniaturized electronics, and digital signal processing technologies. The device can be mounted on the outside of piping for continuous or intermittent monitoring.   The base technology is patented (U.S. Patent No. 6,067,861 issued May 30, 2000) and related improvements are patent pending.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 60 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ intends to award a Firm Fixed Price contract on a sole source basis to The Ensign-Bickford Aerospace and Defense Company.  The requirement is for the acquisition of a M15 Cap, blasting Non-Electric, delay. The contract will consist of the production of 18,000 to 30,000 M15 units. The contract will be awarded as soon as possible after the solicitation is issued. The M15 blasting cap consists of a 70-foot length of shock tube coiled in a figure 80 configuration. On one end it is a factory- installed 200 millisecond delay number 12 commercial blasting cap (outside diameter of 0.294 inch to 0.298 inch) and with a 25 millisecond delay cap  packaged into a holder at the other end. The holder has the capability of  holding a range of one to five shock tube lines. The shock tube consists of a small diameter plastic tube of extruded polymer with a very fine layer of energetic materiel deposited on the inner wall. The shock tube is non- fragmenting and noiseless. Sixty (60) M15 units are packaged in a wooden shipping container.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Aviation & Missile Command intends to procure sole source from Teradyne Incorporated, North Reading MA, Digital Test Units and Spares. These Digital Test Unit and Spares are commercial parts and should be procured under FAR Part 12 entitled, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Digital Test Unit and Spares must be procured from Teradyne, Inc., as they will be used in the production of the Electro-Optics Test Facility (EOTF) and furnished to Northrop Grumman Corporation as Government Equipment  (GFE). The Teradyne design has already been incorporated in the production of the EOTFs. Northrop Grumman Corp.(NGC) chose Teradyne as the source of supply for the digital boards for the EOTF based on their reliability record in the industry. The Digital Test Unit must adhere to form, fit and function of original equipment. In addition, these boards must be backwards compatible with the previous designed Northrop Grumman circuit boards in the Base Shop Test Facility (BSTF). The design of the Digital Test U nit is proprietary to Teradyne and therefore, adequate description/techniques are not available for a competitive procurement. No other source exist that could produce Teradyne's unique and proprietary design utilized in the EOTF. The required Digital Test  Unit quantity, part number follows: 5 ea Teradyne M-920-80 Digital Test Units and 9 ea sets of Spares. See Numbered Notes 22.

<DESC>The U.S Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration (MARAD), South Atlantic Region (SAR), maintains a ship stowage facility for obsolete ships in the National Defense Reserve Fleet, at the James River Reserve Fleet (JRRF), located on the James River in Fort Eustis, VA.  These ships have become obsolete, many are in a dilapidated, unsafe condition, and to some degree all contain various quantities of fuels, oils, asbestos, PCBs, lead paint, and other hazardous materials and wastes.  It is the intent of MARAD to issue a Two-Step Invitation to Bid (IFB) within the next month for the complete dismantling and hazardous materials/hazardous waste (HM/HW) remediation and disposal of four (4) of the ships in the JRRF.  The IFB is limited to domestic ship disposal proposals due to the condition of the vessels and their inability to be towed outside of the United States. MARAD has not yet selected the four ships to be dismantled, but they will be identified at the time the IFB is released. Depending upon the bids received, each ship may be awarded separately, or multiple awards may be made involving any combination of the ships, or alternatively only one award may be made for all four ships.  It is the intent of the Government to contract for the dismantling portion of the work on a firm fixed price basis, with the HM/HW remediation/disposal performed on a cost basis based on actual, verifiable quantities.   It is expected that the IFB for this effort will be issued on the FedBizOps website in February of 2003. The IFB will be issued subject to the availability of funding.

<DESC>The SFW CBU-105B/B (NSN 1325-01-458-4828) is a 1,000-pound class, unpowered, unguided, gravity-drop wide area munition.  The SFW consists of a SUU-66/B tactical munitions dispenser, which houses 10 BLU-108/B submunitions.  Each submunition contains four projectiles, an orientation and stabilization system, a radar altimeter, and a rocket motor.  Each projectile contains an explosively formed penetrator warhead and a two-color infrared sensor.  The SFW is stored and transported as an all up-round in the CNU-411A/E container.  This solicitation for the eighth Full Rate Production (FRP) annual buy will consist of the procurement of 350 full-up CBUs and data.  Additionally, options will be included for the ninth FRP annual buy and the tenth FRP annual buy.  This effort requires contractor personnel be cleared for access to SECRET NOFORN.  Potential contractors must be certified and registered for STINFO export control by the Defense Logistic Service Center (DLSC), Battle Creek MI 49016-3412, telephone number 800-352-3572, to receive any resultant Request for Proposal (RFP).  This certification is above and beyond the requirements for a security clearance and may be obtained by submitting a DD Form 2345 to SLSC.  It is anticipated that only one source, Textron Systems Corp, Wilmington MA, developer of the SFW, can satisfy the Government?s minimum needs for this unique weapon system.

Once at the Website:  Find/Scroll on BAA Solicitation Number:  N00019-03-R-2008.  Click on the listing to open. 
A brief synoposis follows:

1.0 Introduction

Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) is required to provide safe and timely transportation for the President and Vice President of the United States, heads of state and others as directed by the White House Military Office (WHMO).  The global nature of these commitments requires HMX-1 aircraft to deploy worldwide and operate in varying environmental and climatic conditions without mission degradation.  When the President is aboard Marine One, this aircraft is the Commander-in-Chief?s primary command and control platform and must provide the President with the flexibility and capabilities necessary to execute the duties of the office.  

The VH-3D, the current primary aircraft providing this support to the White House, is approaching the end of its service life.  The Navy and Marine Corps have determined the need for a material solution for a Vertical Lift Aircraft (VXX) to Conduct Presidential Support Missions.  As part of the acquisition effort the Navy and Marine Corps intend to evaluate conceptual design trade studies to facilitate the process of developing and fielding a suitable system to perform the current and projected missions assigned to Presidential helicopters.  

2.0 General Description of the VXX Program

The objective of the VXX program is to replace the VH-3D aircraft with a new vertical-lift aircraft through an evolutionary acquisition program, which provides an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) as soon as 2007/2008.  Full Operational Capability (FOC) is desired no later than 2012/2014.

The VXX Mission Needs Statement was approved in September 1999 and an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is currently underway.  The Navy and Marine Corps are preparing for a Milestone decision in summer 2004 and require industry involvement to assist in the validation of program cost, schedule and performance expectations.  Industry is also encouraged to provide innovative concepts, including incremental upgrades, which would enable the Government to meet the acquisition schedule. 

3.0 Concept Design Effort

The Navy and Marine Corps intend that responders to this BAA will propose a concept design package that meets the requirements identified herein.  The proposal will include a detailed Statement of Work that addresses Sections A through J below.  The goal of the contracted effort will be to provide concept design alternative(s) for a VH-3D replacement, substantiated by trade studies and analyses that demonstrate the potential of the proposed alternative(s) to meet VXX performance, cost and schedule objectives.

4.0 Technical Approach - Overview

The VXX AoA is currently analyzing alternatives to fill the VXX mission.  Consistent with the mission needs timeline and affordability constraints, current expectations are that the VXX will be a derivative of an existing air platform; however the Government remains open to any air system that meets VXX requirements.  The Government does not intend to direct the use of any Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), enabling potential vendors maximum flexibility in meeting VXX requirements.  For planning purposes, although there is no commitment by the Government to proceed with any further contractual efforts, contractors should plan for funding levels commensurate with an Acquisition Category (ACAT) I program.  Exact dollar amounts are not provided to allow the offeror some flexibility when bounding performance and schedule expectations for the purposes of this effort.  Offerors are encouraged to optimize Total Ownership Cost (TOC) to best fit a proposed concept and not constrain design concepts to fit within funding levels identified in past, current or future federal budgets.

The appendix contains a statement of required and desired capabilities for the VXX that can be used as a technical point-of-departure for the design effort.  Compliance with the appendix will be a factor during proposal evaluations, however offerors should not discount the importance of utilizing Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) principles to meet affordability goals during concept development.  Therefore, it may be necessary to assess stated performance levels and modify them to meet cost or schedule targets and/or to use evolutionary acquisition concepts and deliver performance incrementally via pre-planned upgrades.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division intends to purchase the following services on a Sole Source Basis from the Institute for Advance Technology (IAT) of the University of Texas (UT) in Austin 3925 West Braker Lane, Austin, TX  78759-5316.  The purpose of the effort is to have IAT conduct studies, conduct research, and provide engineering services in support of an Electromagnetic (EM) Railgun that has the potential for development into long range, shorter time of flight, low signature, and a substantive directed lethality on target Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) weapon which could be based on the Navys all-electric warships with improved ship capability and survivability.  The R&D studies to be undertaken by the Institute for Advanced Technology (IAT) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin during the execution of contract are designed to address the Navys n eeds through analysis, simulation, and experiments that will validate lifetimes and scaling up to a full size Naval Railgun barrel.  The overall objective shall be to develop a reliable and experimentally validated physics and engineering basis for the design of a large-scale hypervelocity NSFS Railgun.   The estimated solicitation issue date is 21 October 2002.  The award is anticipated by 6 December 2002.   The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100 has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area, therefore the synopsis/solicitation with any applicable amendments will be available on the World Wide Web at <http://www.nswc.navy.mil.supply/>.  Hard copies will not be provided.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCDD website to ensure they have downloaded any and all amendments. IAT is currently condu cting research in this area under the Armys 6.1 Science and Technology (S&T) program for medium caliber launchers (MCL).  IAT is an independent, nonprofit organization, operates as a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) for the U.S. Army devoted to research in electrodynamics, hypersonic physics, and pulsed power.  The Army is the primary sponsor and 51% of the annual funds of the IAT are to be provided by the Army.  IAT has developed the capability over the last ten years to undertake focused research on the technologies that enable electromagnetic (EM) Railguns to successfully launch integrated launch packages to hypervelocities [2 to 3 kilometers per second (km/s)].  In all of these facilities, high-speed instrumentation and data collection techniques are employed, including flash X-Rays, B-Dot probes and high-speed cameras.  Combined with IATs other smaller Railgu n test facilities, this offers the possibility of evaluating scale effects experimentally so that the physics understanding obtained with these Railguns can be extrapolated with confidence to Navy capabilities. Interested parties other than IAT must be able to demonstrate, in writing, their capability to provide the requested services.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, through the Record Linkage Master Agreement Pool, is interested in awarding a master agreement order to provide new quantitative information on the relation between radiation dose and the subsequent risk of cancers of stomach, esophagus and pancreas and to generate new data on site-specific, age and temporal patterns of radiation-related cancers of stomach, esophagus and pancreas and the possible influence of chemotherapy and other factors.   This study is part of the larger effort of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics to identify, quantify and understand the risk of cancer in populations exposed to ionizing radiation, alone or in combination with other agents.  The study will also supply important new information relevant to clinical decision-making, as it will be undertaken in cancer survivors and constitutes the first analytic investigation of second gastrointestinal (GI) tumors, incorporating information on radiation dose and chemotherapy. 

The proposed study will focus on patients with a first primary diagnosis of Hodgkins disease, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) or cancer of the female breast, cervix, ovary or testis, who survived at least one year after diagnosis.  It is envisioned that cohorts of patients with a first cancer at one of these sites will undergo computer linkage with registry reports of second primary malignancies.  Lists of these subjects will also be linked to mortality files to identify those who died from a possible second primary cancer and may not have been reported to the registry.  Information on initial and subsequent courses of radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be abstracted for patients who subsequently developed cancer of the stomach, esophagus or pancreas and for matched controls.  It is anticipated that large cohorts of cancer survivors (614,596 breast, 116,746 cervix, 92,209 ovary, 30,055 testis, 95,000 NHL and 32,199 Hodgkins disease) will be identified from several registries and that multiple awards from the Master Agreement Pool will be made.  It is expected that approximately one to two years will be required to accomplish the work described, depending upon the number of patients identified, the accessibility of treatment data and the availability of vital status information. 

This Master Agreement Order (MAO) RFP is available to all population-based cancer registries in the United States and in other countries who were awarded Master Agreements entitled, Record Linkage Studies Utilizing Resources in Population-Based Tumor Registries.  Those firms currently in the Master Agreement Pool have already submitted proposals which have determined them to be prequalified to propose for work issued under this mechanism.  Proposals will only be considered from offerors currently in the Master Agreement Pool.  Those who are not currently in the Master Agreement Pool and who wish to be considered for inclusion in the pool should consult the Research Contracts Branch Home Page http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/  click on Current Requests for Proposals, scroll down to Master Agreement Announcements and refer to RFP NO1-CP-01003-13.  The duration of the existing Master Agreement Pool is through July 30, 2005.  The due date for Master Agreement proposals is March 20 of each year for those interested in being included in the projected annual review.  It is anticipated that the Master Agreement Order RFP will be available on or about February 12, 2003.  Anticipated award date is August 31, 2003.  No collect calls will be accepted.

During the life of the contract, and under its terms and conditions, the Government may request, or the Contractor may propose to provide, technologically advanced equipment, components, software or any other item(s) contracted hereunder. Types of Upgrades - The upgrades covered by this clause will generally be substituted for functional items/systems already in the contract. The substitution may be in total or in part. The upgrades discussed in this clause are not replacements for items or systems already ordered and installed, and nothing in this clause shall be construed as authority for such replacement of installed equipment. The one exception to this exclusion is software. Installed software will always be eligible for an "upgrade," to allow the Government to maintain currency, consistency, and the compatibility in its software. It is further understood by the parties to this contract that this clause envisages technological refreshment related to the general type of hardware and software covered by the scope of this contract. Minimum Qualifications for Acceptance of Upgrades - The Government is under no obligation to substitute any item for an item already listed in the contract. However, subject to mutual agreement when required above, when items are added to this contract under this clause, the item or items shall meet the following criteria: (1) have been sold to the general public in substantial quantities before substitution under this clause; (2) meet or exceed all mandatory requirements of the contract; (3) be fully compatible with the originally proposed equipment; (4) the price should be equal or less than the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the item. The Contractor shall agree to all terms and conditions, including delivery and installation, being equal to or more favorable to the Government than the substituted equipment; (5) be judged technically acceptable by the COTR; (6) be approved in writing, by execution of a contract modification, signed by both the FBI Contracting Officer and the Contractor's representative; and (7) shall undergo acceptance testing in accordance with the terms of the contract. Pricing of Upgrades - The pricing of upgraded item(s) shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis provided that the final price shall not exceed the limitations specified above. Delivery of Upgrades - Notwithstanding the delivery requirements set forth above, initial delivery requirements for upgraded items shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this contract at the time the upgrade item is added. The Contracting Officer shall have the right to set the delivery schedule based on the longer of the standard commercial delivery schedule of the item(s) or the contract's standard delivery schedule for similar item(s), if a mutually agreeable schedule cannot be met. After the first 60 days, the original contract schedule for delivery takes effect if it is less than the initial agreed upon delivery time. Identification of Technologically Advanced Products - While the Government reserves the right to independently solicit a proposal from the Contractor under the terms of this clause at any time, potential upgrades will normally be brought to the attention of the Government by the Contractor. Offers shall be submitted on an SF-1449 and are due by close of business on February 10, 2003. Please submit any questions, in writing, by January 30, 2003 to Karen Smith at the following facsimile number - (202) 324-5722.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Slovnaft Incinerator Upgrade Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the ugrade of incinerators at Slovnaft.  This study would assist Slovnaft in making a strategic decision on how best to deal with their aging incinerators, provide detailed upgrade/replacement solutions and outline a detailed strategy for complying with environmental standards. 

Slovnaft, a.s., is the major downstream oil and petrochemical company in Slovakia.  Slovnaft processes crude oil into a range of petroleum and petrochemical products, is the largest marketer of petroleum products in the country, and enjoys a significant wholesale and retail presence in surrounding countries.

Currently, Slovnaft operates three incinerators for processing solid and sludge waste, including hazardous waste, at its refinery and petrochemical complex in Bratislava.  The incinerators at Slovnaft are 20 to 30 years old and equipped with outdated and insufficient pollution control equipment that does not meet existing regulations for waste incinerators.  Noncompliance risks suspension of operations, which makes this project (the continuation of Slovnaft's operations) crucial.

The proposed project will reduce emissions of hazardous gases and other potential contamination and will help Slovnaft comply with new, stricter environmental regulations.  The project will enable Slovnaft to dispose of the industrial and solid waste it generates in an environmentally sound manner. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $250,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, March 7, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures a firm fixed price award to Ms. Marilyn Newton, 21 Old Granary Court, Catonsville, Maryland  21228.  The purpose of this contract is two-fold:  (1) to procure expert services to assist CMS staff in planning and conducting all data analyses relevant to developing proposed and final rules for the OPPS for 2004; and, (2) to procure expert services to prepare CMS staff to assume full responsibility beginning with the 2005 OPPS update for every aspect of planning and conducting the data analyses necessary for the annual OPPS updates, and to transition full coordination of the OPPS data programs and standard analytic data files to permanent CMS staff.  The contractor would perform the following tasks for the 2004 OPPS update and provide advice and guidance in transitioning these tasks to CMS staff for future updates:  Assist in coordinating activities related to incorporating new policy decisions into rate calculations and impact analyses.  Provide quality assurance of activities related to analyses needed for publication of the OPPS proposed and final rules for 2003, including construction of addenda and public use files. (1)Provide advice and assistance in coordinating individual and group tasks needed to generate work products.
(2)Provide advice on the development of specifications and data requirements to construct a standard analytical file for annual update of OPPS and policy analysis. (3)Provide advice on the development of the approach and processes needed to evaluate data obtained from secondary sources to evaluate the clinical integrity of specific payment groups and relative payment weights.
(4)Provide advice related to methods for renovating current programming to maximize efficient and accurate data processing.
(5)Evaluate and assess reasonableness of final results within the context of discretionary and statutory policies and requirements.
(6)Assist in developing thorough documentation of processes, analytical files and related workflows that underlie the proposed and final OPPS rules. Updating the OPPS for 2004 in accordance with statutory mandates and policy refinements implemented in the 2003 update requires the assistance of a contractor with extensive knowledge and experience in performing Medicare systems analyses combined with a thorough familiarity with the data and ratesetting models that were the basis of the 2003 OPPS update.  To ensure that accurate data are captured for the OPPS update requires expert knowledge of the claims processing format and system as well policy determinations made for the 2003 update related to the sunsetting of pass-through payments and special provisions implemented in 2003 related to payments for drugs and biologicals.  Marilyn Newton possesses the experience, knowledge, and expertise that are required for this project.  She has over 30 years of experience with Medicare payment systems that she acquired as a CMS employee.  For 26 of these years, she performed research, systems analyses, and data development for various payment systems including the Medicare inpatient prospective payment system and the physician fee schedule.  During a substantial number of those years, she planned, prioritized, and directed the work of a large staff responsible for completing such tasks.  As a result of this work, Ms. Newton has acquired in-depth knowledge of Medicare data reporting requirements and claims processing.  She has vast knowledge and experience with the various systems through which Medicare bills are processed and the types of edits applied to each system.  She has expert knowledge of the Claims Expansion/Line Items Processing (CELIP), which hospitals are required to use to bill for outpatient services paid under the OPPS, and the software that is used to edit and pay these claims.  She has considerable experience with and knowledge of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) that is required for OPPS billing and used to construct the OPPS analytical data files.  In 1999, Ms. Newton assisted in completing the system analyses and data modeling that resulted in the successful implementation of the new OPPS on August 1, 2000.  Ms. Newton provided invaluable assistance in modifying the OPPS analytical files to incorporate new policy decisions and requirements for the 2001, 2002, and 2003 OPPS updates.  Ms. Newton?s extensive experience in working with the OPPS analytical files and programs coupled with her extensive past experience as a leader in resolving policy issues, constructing appropriate data files, and coordinating the programming needed for the 2001, 2002, and 2003 OPPS updates amplify her importance in successfully updating the OPPS for 2004.  Her expert services are essential to assist a team of policy analysts in identifying the data elements, files, and programming that require modification; to analyze and resolve policy issues related to such modifications; to coordinate the programming that incorporates policy changes; to calculate payment rates and relative weights; to develop impact analyses; to construct all addenda and related public use files for the 2004 proposed and final rules; to renovate programs for maximum efficiency in data processing; and to implement appropriate data file documentation.  
In addition, CMS will be assuming full responsibility beginning with the 2005 OPPS update for every aspect of planning and conducting the data analyses necessary for the annual OPPS updates.  Because Ms. Newton was primarily responsible for these tasks for the 2001-2003 OPPS updates, Ms. Newton?s services are essential to prepare for the transition of full coordination of the OPPS data programs and standard analytic data files to permanent CMS staff.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

2002?
Due date has changed to December 19, 2002.
2. Can you clarify a statement that was made at the pre-submittal meeting on
November 5, 2002, and answer a question for me. On the Socio-Economic
Goals Chart the following information was given:
49% Small Business
5% Small Disadvantaged Business
5% Woman Owned Small Business
Does this mean that 50% of this project will be to a combined group of Small
Business, Small Disadvantaged Business and Women Owned Small Business?
No, the 40% represent the total Small business amount. The 40%
includes the Hubzone small business (2%), small disadvantaged (5%),
women - owned small business (5%), veteran-owned small business (3%),
and service-disabled veteran-owned small business (3%). Note that of the
40% to all small business firms, 18% is going to the minority category
and the remaining 22% is going to other non-minority small business
firms.
Secondly, can you explain what is meant by the ?Small Business
Competitiveness Demonstration Program.??
Yes. The Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program was
established to (a) test the ability of small businesses to compete
successfully in certain industry categories without competition being
restricted by the use of small business set-asides, (b) measure the extent to
which awards are made to a new category of small businesses known as
emerging small businesses (ESB's), and to provide for certain acquisitions
to be reserved for ESB participation only, and (c) expand small business
participation in 10 targeted industry categories through continued use of
set-aside procedures, increased management attention, and specifically
tailored acquisition procedures.

6. The Pre-solicitation notice for the New Courthouse project states that: ?All
services under this contract shall be performed under the direction/supervision
of professional architects and/or engineers with substantial construction
experience.? Is this required for the CM Services Contract for this project?
Yes, this is required for the members of the CM team who provide
direction/supervision and professional services oversight.

A selection has not been made to date. GSA has short-listed six firms to

want the CM to include in its team design architects and engineers to check
the drawings.

through the design/build phase and will review construction drawings for
design intent compliance only. The CM will provide design review
services for conformance with the Bridging documents.
9. During construction phase, will the CM team be responsible for providing a
full time on site inspector of record to check code conformance.

Consideration for contract services is limited to firms having an active
office in the State of California (geographic limit).

experience, GSA will consider this along with your design experience.
11/18/02

requirements apply at that point.
30. Who will prepare design specifications for the demolition/abatement contract?
The CM will assist in the preparation of the contract documents.

construction phase teams in Stage I.

selected prior to the 03 December 02 submittal date or after any job fair for
small businesses?

Any sub-consultants whose experience or capability will enhance your
proposal should be identified at Stage I.

<P></P>
<P>College Park, MD ! On Wednesday, February 5, 2003, the National Archives and 
Records Administration will host an Industry Day for the Electronic Records 
Archives (ERA). Vendors interested in obtaining information about ERA are 
invited to attend. The ERA Industry Day will include technical, program 
management and acquisition presentations about the ERA program. The National 
Archives will conduct an Open Panel Discussion to address questions and comments 
from vendors and industry attendees. Since there is no single commercial 
solution available today that meets the full end-to-end requirements for ERA, 
the National Archives is interested in exploring creative ideas and possible 
solutions to the continuing challenges posed by electronic records.</P>
<P>Industry Day will include:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Briefings about the ERA program, ERA's technical understanding, and the 
  acquisition strategy. 
  <LI>Vendor dialogue to ensure an accurate understanding of the challenges 
  facing ERA and the requirements to meet those challenges 
  <LI>Information gathering from vendors and industry about technology 
  availability and strategy issues</LI></UL>
<P>Industry Day, which is free, will take place in the Auditorium at the 
National Archives College Park facility, located at 8601 Adelphi Road. Sign-in 
will begin at 11:15 AM. The discussion will begin at noon and end at 5 PM. For 
more information call, 301-837-2990 or visit the ERA Industry Day website at: <A 
href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/presentations/industry_day/index.html">www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/presentations/industry_day/index.html</A>.</P>
<P>To fulfill its mission, the National Archives needs to respond effectively to 
the challenge posed by the diversity, complexity, and enormous volume of 
electronic records being created today and the rapidly changing nature of the 
systems that are used to create them. The Electronic Records Archives (ERA) will 
be a comprehensive, systematic, and dynamic means for preserving virtually any 
kind of electronic record, free from dependence on any specific hardware or 
software. ERA, when operational, will make it easy for NARA customers to find 
records they want, and easy for NARA to deliver those records in formats suited 
to customers' needs.</P><I></I>
<P>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) ensures, for the 
citizen, the President, the Congress and the Courts, ready access to essential 
evidence that documents the rights of citizens, the actions of federal 
officials, and the national experience. The National Archives is a public trust 
that plays a key role in fostering effective and responsible government through 
management of the life cycle of records in all three Branches of the federal 
government and through sustained access to historically valuable records in the 
National Archives and the Presidential Libraries. These records enable people to 
inspect for themselves what the government has done, allow officials and 
agencies to review their actions, and help citizens hold them accountable. </P>

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 45 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, Albuquerque, New Mexico, has a requirement for two (2) Kinemetrics/Quanterra Q330 advance broadband digitizers with 6 input channels, gps receivers and connector kits, and two (2) Kinemetrics Model ES-T EpiSensor Triaxial Force Balance Accelerometers.  This equipment is to be used to upgrade Kinemetrics seismic monitoring equipment currently in use on site in El Salvador. Digitizers must have low power consumption of less than 0.7 watts, high precision timing of 0.1 ms, and Ethernet interface capabilities.  Accelerometers must have low noise feature, extended bandwidth of DC to 300 Hz, user-selectable full-scale range, calibration coil, and differential.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 5.302-1, the Government considers the item specified as a sole source from Kinemetrics, Inc., 222 Vista Avenue, Pasadena, California, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered. Firms who feel that they can furnish the required supplies and services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement. See Note 22.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice seeks capability statements from qualified small business concerns (NAICS code 541611, small business size standard is $6 million) for competitive consideration.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue multiple indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity competitive task order contracts to supply technical support services to the CDC, its grantees, and other partners in the delivery of HIV, STD, and TB prevention programs, care/support included in Global Aids Program and related prevention services.  In addition, technical support will be provided to strengthen the capacity of governmental and the non-governmental/community prevention infrastructure in support of HIV, STD, TB and related services; to assist in the implementation of systems to ensure the quality and integration of services (particularly HIV, STD, TB) as well as linkages to treatment and cure; and to provide technical assistance in all aspects of program planning, implementation, and evaluation.  In order to accomplish this task, it is anticipated that the contractor will form partnerships with organizations having large networks of experts able to address the topics and needs of the Government and its grantees.  The Contractor shall provide ongoing technical support in the form of consultation, guidelines, training, capacity building and performance of surveillance, prevention interventions, and program planning, management, and evaluation.  The contractor shall be responsible for coordinating and conducting complex surveys, focus groups, workshops, and evaluations.  Specifically, the contractor shall be required to perform complex evaluation study designs, case studies, economic evaluations, data collection and analysis, impact evaluations, onsite program assessments, pilot studies, demonstration programs; formative research services, and other relates tasks.  The contractor shall be responsible for design, development, and implementation of training services for prevention programs including provision of curriculum development, training aids, and need assessments.  

Interested small business firms having the capabilities to perform this work must demonstrate and document, in any capability statements submitted, extensive experience performing the above tasks and especially must demonstrate the capability to administer and coordinate these interrelated tasks in an effective and timely manner.   It is estimated that 15-20 new task orders will be issued per year with a total value of $5M to $8M per year.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capabilities of businesses interested in providing dosimetry services to NIH.  NIH possesses a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license authorizing its use of radioactive materials that includes requirements to perform routine monitoring for external personnel exposure, notification of  individuals and supervisors of exposures approaching maximum permissible limits, and recommendations for  remedial action when appropriate.  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government (the Customer), the Contractor shall furnish the personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies necessary to provide a comprehensive exposure monitoring program, including associated services, in accordance with the requirements of the NIH license.  Through the Radiation Safety Branch (RSB) and Division of Safety (DS), the Office of Research Services (ORS) provides radiation exposure monitoring services to NIH employees who utilize radioactive materials and radiation producing equipment in the course of their research.  The ORS is seeking organizations that can provide state of the art dosimetry equipment, timely reading and reporting of the monitoring results, and a comprehensive, interactive database from which historical and regulatory data may be readily obtained. The period of performance will be for a base year with four (4) one year option periods.  The intended procurement will be classified under NAICS Code 541380 size standard 6.0 million.  The ORS intends to award a new contract to the dosimetry provider whose services most adequately support the programs of the office.  Services that will be required through this procurement will include, but are not limited to, the furnishing of all personnel, labor, facilities, equipment, parts, materials, and supplies considered essential for providing specified types of personnel, environmental, and calibration/monitoring of dosimeters and associated services in accordance with NIH requirements.  These requirements will include maintaining a Certificate of Accreditation from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through its National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) for all test categories applicable to whole body, extremity, and environmental dosimeters.  Additional requirements include the ability to utilize existing NIH systems for record keeping and identification of employees and lab groups, permitting direct computer access to personnel monitoring database(s), participation in a joint QA/QC program as directed by the RSB, and providing dosimetry equipment that is hermetically sealed such that it permits gas and/or liquid wash sterilization while guarding against damage from water and laboratory chemicals.  Additionally, qualified businesses should demonstrate a propensity for the development and incorporation of innovative and efficiency-improving systems, products, and services into their proposed dosimetry service. An example would be the availability of operational or electronic dosimeter systems that allow for on-site management of personnel exposures. Experience in managing similar dosimetry service contracts must be demonstrated. This market survey is being conducted through the CBD to reach the widest possible audience and to gather current market information.  Responding firms should provide two (2) copies of their capability statement to address this sources sought to the above address by the Office of Procurement Management at the address provided not later than February 24, 2003.

<SUBJECT>D -- Tecnical Computer Services Contract (TCSC)
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT: The 30th Space Wing intends to extend the Technical Computer Services Contract (TCSC) #F04684-98-C-0016 with MCA Engineers, Inc. for a period of six (6) months (1 Apr - 30 Sep 2003). By extending the TCSC contract, launch mission critical services will be uniterupted while the new eight year Western Range Operations Communications Information (WROCI) Contract services are being competed under solicitation F04684-01-R-0008. The current TCSC contract provides administrative and technical support to the overall diversified mission of the 30th Space Wing. This currrent contract provides support to include: delivery, installation, operation, maintenance, programming/reprograming (hardware and software) and management of computer resources; computer security, life cycle acquistion management at Vandenberg AFB CA. The requirements of this contract requires establishment of configuration control of hardware and software on user desktops, labtops, networks, installation and maintenance support for mission critical computers. All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, development of O&M procedures, and obtaining of certifications and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruprion of TCSC services or change to launch mission schedules. Phase-in will not be included due to the aggressive launch mission schedule, the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from the interuption of these services. The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay to mission schedules. Any replies to this notice must be received with 15 day of this notice.

<OFFADD>Department of Justice, Office of the Federal Detention Trustee, Headquarters Office, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1210, Washington, DC, 20530
<SUBJECT>D -- National Repository for Detention Space Availability
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit (1) comments and questions relating to the development of the Statement of Work for the National Repository for Detention Space Availability (hereinafter ''Repository'') that incorporate current technologies and best practices from the competitive marketplace, and (2) industry interest in the Repository project. 

BACKGROUND: The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) was established and activated in September 2001 by directive of Congress (Pub. L. 106-553, 166, 114 Stat. 2762 (2000)) in response to growing concerns regarding Federal detention.  The Federal Detention Trustee leads the development of Department of Justice (DOJ) detention policy and manages Federal detention resources to maximize available detention space and contain costs associated with the detention of criminal defendants and aliens awaiting adjudication and/or removal from the United States.  Additionally, the Federal Detention Trustee ensures that the DOJ provides safe, secure, and humane detention services and works with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to identify emerging detention-related problems and project future detention space needs.  Additional information describing the mission and activities of the Federal Detention Trustee is available on the Trustee's Internet web site. 

As part of the fiscal year 2003 budget, it is anticipated that the OFDT will receive an appropriation for the development of the Repository.  The primary goal of the Repository is to allow state, local, and private detention space providers to post detention space availability, daily rates, and services available for federal use.  The Repository will be used by federal law enforcement officers to identify (and place detainees into) operationally and fiscally efficient detention facilities.  It will assist the Federal Detention Trustee with ensuring that necessary state, local, and private detention space is identified and utilized in a cost-effective manner.  Additionally, the Repository will facilitate the processing and payment of invoices for detention services provided to the USMS and INS.  The Repository will support DOJ strategic objectives and annual performance goals by (1) improving procedures for acquiring necessary detention space;  (2) improving the management of detention-related resources to contain costs; and (3) using detention resources in a more cost-effective and efficient manner.

To meet the identified goals and to ensure nationwide accessibility, the Repository will be developed as an Internet-based application.  It will be designed to handle at least 5,000 user sessions daily.  Additionally, the Repository will be designed to be accessible via mobile personal digital assistants (PDAs).

PROJECT SCHEDULE:  Development and implementation of the Repository will be conducted in three phases: (1) planning and requirements analysis;  (2) system development and integration; and (3) operations and maintenance.  Phase 1 will include fully defining the scope of the Repository, developing a comprehensive concept of operations; preparing the necessary Department of Justice-required documentation to justify continued development, or termination, of the Repository; and identifying and resolving risks associated with implementation of the Repository.  Phase 2 will consist of system development, integration, and implementation to include software development, interfacing with legacy systems, as appropriate, pilot testing, preparation of documentation and necessary training manuals, start-up, and data migration from legacy systems.  (Phases 1 and 2 may be conducted concurrently.)  Phase 3 will consist of (a) operation of the Repository and providing support for external users and (b) application support, maintenance, and improvement.

Phases 1 and 2 will be performed in conjunction with two regional pilot projects the OFDT is undertaking in the Chicago, IL and El Paso, TX/Las Cruces, NM areas.  Accordingly, based on the anticipated costs, import to the DOJ missions, and the associated risks, the OFDT has selected the Rapid Application Development (RAD) work pattern, as defined in the DOJ Systems Development Life Cycle Guidance Document (See, http://www.usdoj.gov/jmd/irm/lifecycle/table.htm) as the appropriate work pattern to design and develop the Repository.

Development of the Repository is contingent upon Congressional approval of the President's budget request for the OFDT.  (See, S. 2778)

DISCLAIMER:  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Federal Detention Trustee.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by the Federal Detention Trustee to form a binding contract. The Federal Detention Trustee does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses or otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the use of such information.  All information received as a result of this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses will not be acknowledged or returned. Respondents may be invited to make an oral presentation to the Federal Detention Trustee concerning their response to this RFI.

As a result of this RFI, the OFDT may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an additional RFI.  However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the use of such information either as part of the evaluation process or in developing the specifications for any subsequent requirement.

SUBMISSIONS: Respondents may provide - but are not limited to providing - the following information: (1) a statement indicating interest and capability to perform the required tasks; (2) a statement describing the respondent's proposed technical approach to the identified tasks;  (3) suggestions regarding the Statement of Work or conceptual improvements to the project;  (4) suggestions for an appropriate schedule and/or development period;  and (5) suggestions for a fee schedule.  All submitted materials should be submitted to the OFDT on, or before March 13, 2003.  Materials should be mailed to: Office of the Federal Detention Trustee, Attn: Lori Ray, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1210, Washington, DC 20530.
