DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. 
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SK2 Vasylik vasylykd@saipan.navy.mil
