NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operat ional, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. ***SOURCE APPROVAL*** LOCKHEED MARTIN IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY FOR THESE ITEMS. LOCKHEED MARTIN IS THE DESIGN AGENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATOR AND THE NAVSEA APPROVED SOURCE OF SUPPLY AND CERTIFIED DEPOT FOR THE AN/UYQ-70(V) WEAPON SYSTEM.

Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing/repair knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from/repair by other sources, nor qualify testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and select items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review disclosures that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be econmoically obtained. The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase / contract repair of this part from additional sources. It has been determined to be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer the part.

This part must be acquired from/repaired by a source(s)specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by thecurrent version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing/repair knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from/repair by other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.
