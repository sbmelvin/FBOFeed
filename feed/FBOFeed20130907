Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid.

<CONTACT>Mario D. Gray, Phone 3014352238, Email Mario.Gray@nih.hhs.gov
<DESC>INTRODUCTION:<br /><br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support Contracts and Simplified Acquisitions Branch (SS/SA), on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition to Tucker-Davis Technologies Incorporated for an Upgrade to the Existing Proprietary Tucker-Davis Electrophysiological Recording Equipment.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE:</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 334519 with a Size Standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY:</p>
<p>The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-69 effective September 3, 2013.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in the FAR subpart 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures at an amount not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p>STATUTORY AUTHORITY:</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. Acquisitions using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.</p>
<p>Government's Requirements and Need Description:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the equipment needed for an Upgrade to the Existing Proprietary Tucker-Davis Electrophysiological Recording Equipment according to the general description of the salient physical, functional, and performance characteristics as follows:</p>
<p>The Existing Proprietary Tucker-Davis Electrophysiological Recording Equipment:<br />- Headstages<br />- Amplifier<br />- IO board for data acquisition<br />- Computer and software solutions</p>
<p><br />The needed equipment for an Upgrade to the Existing Proprietary Tucker-Davis Electrophysiological Recording Equipment:<br />- Equipment/Description/Quantity:<br />RZ2-4/Z-Series 4 DSP High Performance Processor/1.<br />Trade-in/Trade-In Credit to Return RZ2-4 (2009)/1.<br />RZ_DSP_S/DSP for RZ Processor for RS4 Streamer/1.<br />RS4-1/Z-Series 1-Port Data Streamer/1.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The NIH/NIMH has recently used laminar multicontact arrays to show that the perirhinal cortex provides a unique set of functional mechanisms that support memory formation. However, the role of the primate hippocampus in memory is poorly understood. This stands in contrast to a large body of evidence from rodent studies suggesting an involvement of the hippocampus in memory. However, rodent studies typically use tasks that are based on spatial navigation. To test whether the primate hippocampus is important for navigation-based spatial memory in primates, just like it is in rodents, we will record single unit activity from the primate hippocampus while monkeys perform a computer-based virtual-reality spatial memory task.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie memory function in the primate brain. To that end we will record single neurons using bundles of up to 128 microwires. The recording system needs to be able to simultaneously record broadband activity at a high sampling rate, as well as to perform online spike sorting algorithms. Our present system is not fully capable of this, and, therefore, needs to be upgraded.</p>
<p>Period of Performance or/and Delivery Information/Contract Type:</p>
<p>Delivery Within: 8 - 10 Weeks After Receipt of Order. The contract type will be Firm-Fixed-Price.</p>
<p>Project Description:</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie memory function in the primate brain. To that end we will record single neurons using bundles of up to 128 microwires. The recording system needs to be able to simultaneously record broadband activity at a high sampling rate, as well as to perform online spike sorting algorithms. Our present system is not fully capable of this, and, therefore, needs to be upgraded.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>Not Applicable</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION:</p>
<p><br />The determination by the government to award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) is based upon market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research, specifically the review and evaluation of responses received to the sources sought notice published in the FedBizOpps on August 26, 2013.</p>
<p>The results of the market research concluded that the Tucker-Davis Technologies Incorporated (TDT) is the only company which can provide the needed Upgrade to the Existing Proprietary Tucker-Davis Electrophysiological Recording Equipment. Therefore, TDT is the company which can provide equipment needed for the purpose of compatibility with the Government's existing equipment to identify the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie memory function in the primate brain.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT:</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All responses must reference the identifier code as follows: PS3033406. All responses must be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist, Mario Gray, using the e-mail address as follows: Mario.Gray@nih.hhs.gov, and, by the closing date and time of this notice. Fax responses will not be accepted.</p>

<p>The purpose of this requirement is to provide a broad range of support tasks needed to operate, develop, maintain and enhance the Bureau's critical IT system, the BCRS Management Information System Solution (BMISS).  This will enable the BCRS to better utilize BMISS by sustaining existing and integrating new business processes into the software to manage legislative updates and other changes that occur periodically.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSA) Bureau of Clinician Recruitment and Service (BCRS) mission is to coordinate the recruitment and retention of health professionals in underserved communities and support efforts to build more integrated and sustainable health care systems. BCRS recruits health care providers through scholarship and loan repayment programs that help underserved communities and health care shortage facilities recruit and retain qualified primary care health professionals.  Program participants provide primary health care to underserved populations, in communities designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs), in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Trust Territories.<br />In 2009, BCRS started a bureau-wide project to consolidate a number of independent software applications used to manage the participant application process throughout their term of service along with managing health care delivery sites where clinicians serve. This development effort resulted in the launch of BMISS.</p>
<p>BMISS is a mission-important system designed to ensure that Loan Repayment and Scholarship Programs administered by the BCRS are managed efficiently and in compliance with mandated Agency-wide and Federal policies, procedures and legislation.  The system supports planning, application submission, application review, application prioritization and ranking, selection, awards, payment tracking, payroll and invoice processing, self-service customer service portals, Sites and Participant lifecycle program compliance, and closeout phases.  BMISS supports work load management within the BCRS as well as reporting of program data and task management metrics.<br />BMISS includes a Section 508-compliant user interface with workflow tasks, a user specific task-list and advanced search capabilities.</p>
<p>BMISS supports more than 100,000 external user accounts and 300+ internal users. The system has eight (8) active loan and scholarship programs supported by 889 accredited schools and 16,742 approved clinical sites. In FY 2012 alone, the BCRS issued $294,608,924.85 in loan and scholarship dollars through 6,309 awards. The BMISS system routinely handles hundreds of concurrent users.</p>

<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Intent: </span></strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) intends to award a purchase order to support SAMHSA's efforts to educate the general public about the benefits of addiction treatment and recovery for those experiencing alcohol and drug problems.</p>
<p>In Accordance with 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) Entertainment Industry Council, Inc. (EIC) is the only responsible source that is able to satisfy agency requirements. In order to ensure mission success it is essential to utilize EIC unique access National Association of Broadcasters and the American Society of Journalists and Authors, they have the capability to reach millions of viewers on a daily basis through programs the audience chooses to watch and through the characters with whom they have a strong affinity. EIC possesses exclusive contacts and access to the entertainment creative community which generates the scripts and storylines for movies and TV programs alike. EIC is able to relay to screenwriters what the national addiction recovery leadership witnesses, including the challenges and benefits of recovery, via their expertise, anecdotes, and research.<br />Background:</p>
<p>The use of terms and language in television, radio, and written press related to mental and/or substance use disorders greatly influences public opinion related to these issues. To reduce the negatively nuanced language and promote positive terminology for referring to mental and/or substance use disorder issues, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will seek to educate television and radio producers, screen writers, and the entertainment journalists and authors on how to best use language that promotes a better understanding of the issues, and that is free of biased and discriminatory overtones.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description: </span></strong></p>
<p>SAMHSA proposes to continue its work with the Entertainment Industries Council (EIC) to organize two webinars: one in collaboration with the National Association of Broadcasters; and one with the Association of Journalists and Authors. The webinars will be conducted in a panel format using health, social marketing, and persons in recovery. Topics to be covered will include the anatomy of current language that is used to refer to persons in recovery in the entertainment industry media and conversely, the appropriate terminology to use when referring to those that have a mental and/or substance use disorder. Moreover the panel will cover the potential negative consequences of not using appropriate language and hear examples of experiences lived by those in recovery as a result.</p>
<p>By working with writers and producers, EIC can help the entertainment industry in producing programs that depict these issues in an entertaining and educational way. Ultimately, with accurate onscreen portrayals that there is hope in recovery from these conditions, more people who are suffering, their friends, family, and peers, may seek prevention, treatment, and recovery support services and join the ranks of those who live healthy and productive lives in recovery.</p>
<p>EIC will work to educate broadcast industry producers and writers, technical and non technical production staff, and the magazine industry editors who cover the entertainment industry on how the use of language can affect the broader community as it relates to mental and/or substance use disorder issues. The effort calls for the webinars to be conducted in partnership with the National Association Broadcasters and the American Society of Journalists and Authors. The effort aims to increase the knowledge and understanding within these sectors about how the use of language can positively or negatively affect public opinion about individuals who have or are in recovery from mental or substance use disorders.</p>

Purpose of this acquisition - The Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) seeks to procure a Storage Area Network (SAN) solution to support its Mainframe processing environment. The provided solution shall replace the RRB's current EMC<sup>2</sup> Symmetrix DMX 1000 SAN to provide disk storage for RRB applications and data run on an IBM Z9 Mainframe model 2096-S07 L03 200 MIP. B. RRB General Information - The U. S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is an independent Federal agency that administers a retirement and survivor benefits program for railroad employees and their families.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The RRB was established by the Railroad Retirement Acts of 1937 and 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its benefits program was the forerunner of the more familiar Social Security System.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Railroad Retirement System is unique inasmuch as it is the only federally administered benefits program covering a single private industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The RRB also administers the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, which provides unemployment and sickness benefits to railroad employees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>C. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background </span>The RRB was advised that the EMC<sup>2</sup> Symmetrix DMX 1000 SAN had reached its end of service life as of June 30, 2013.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EMC<sup>2</sup> stated that "they would no longer be able to provide contracted support for the hardware &amp; software after that date. Although fully operational, the RRB wants to replace the EMC<sup>2</sup> Symmetrix DMX 1000 SAN with a SAN, that fully supports its IBM mainframe based applications and data, and is in current production and fully supported by the manufacturer to ensure continuity of IT operations supporting the RRB's benefit program mission. *<span style="text-decoration: underline;">SEE ATTACHED FORMATTED RFP; SF 1449 and ATTACHMENTS.*</span></span></p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Description of Requirement
The USEPA Western Ecology Division (WED) is looking to procure overhead warehouse doors for several of their buildings in the Corvallis, Oregon area.

Two (2) are located in the Shop supply building and they are both 10'x15', the Terrestrial Effects Research Facility (TERF) building has one (1) at 12'x12', and the Willamette Research Station (WRS) has one (1) at 12'x16'.  Sizes of doors are expressed in by feet measurements. Work is to be performed at two sites.  The Shop and Supply building and the TERF building are located on EPA's WED main site, 200 SW 35th Street Corvallis OR 97333.  The WRS building is located at 1350 SE Goodnight Ave, Corvallis OR 97333.
WED's Shop and Supply building is a two story structure constructed precast tilt-up, one door has failed and the other is nearing the end of its useful life.  WED's TERF building is a one story structure with a high bay area constructed precast tilt-up structure whose door has failed. WED's WRS main building is a two story structure of conventional construction whose door has failed.  Some of the doors do not have emergency stop features which present safety issues.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal Criminal Tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have" the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF. The WAWF website is located at https://wawf.eb.mil. There is no charge to use WAWF.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in caseswhere enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award,the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d)Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    <br>    <br>  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This synopsis/solicitation is issued for commercial items in accordance with FAR Part 12 using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-69 effective September 3, 2013.    <br>  This acquisition is set aside 100% for small business.   Applicable NAICS 332312 (Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing) small business size standard is 500 employees.   <br>  13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.  <br>  (a) A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.  <br>  (b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.  <br>  (c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)  <br>  ===============================================================  <br>  Contract Line Item Number (CLIN):    <br>    <br>  0001, Mobile tower unit, Qty 1, Each  <br>    <br>  Description of requirement: The Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG) requires one (1) each, mobile (trailer), 100 foot tower in accordance with the below descriptions:  <br>  1.  PURPOSE  <br>  The Florida National Guard Counterdrug Program conducts communications and reconnaissance support to the Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) throughout the State of Florida.  The FLCDP requires the ability to integrate disparate communications and surveillance systems with supported LEAs in order to bolster operational cohesion in the joint environment.    <br>    <br>  Due to a lack of natural elevated terrain in Florida, extending line-of-sight communications and surveillance capabilities to cover large or specific target centric areas of operations has proven to be difficult. A mobile, trailered tower system will give the FLCDP the ability to:  <br>    <br>   	Extend the range of UHF/VHF and 800 mhz radios as a mobile repeater station.  <br>    <br>   	Emplace long-range surveillance devices for increased stand-off distance for site   <br>  survey selection and target monitoring.   <br>    <br>   	Conduct aerial and maritime radar surveillance in operating environments that   <br>  lack man-made or natural elevation.   <br>    <br>  2.  Requirement  <br>  The Mobile (trailer) Tower System must include:  <br>    <br>  Tower:  <br>  A.

Minimum of 2 x 110VAC 50/60Hz and 2 x 220VAC 60-50Hz power outlets at top of tower mast with mast length commercial grade cabling to generator.  <br>    <br>  E.	At least Five (5) Co-axle/auxiliary cable rings to keep cables organized while tower is extended.  <br>    <br>  F.	Medium intensity Aviation Obstruction Lighting compliant with FAA AC 70/7460-1K.  <br>    <br>  G.	Halogen Work Lights.  <br>    <br>  H.	Tower locking mechanism when at extended height.  <br>    <br>  I.	Tower transport lock.  <br>    <br>  J.	Hydraulic tilt assembly with integrated safety features.  <br>    <br>  K.	Weather rated 1Horse Power motor assembly.  <br>  Trailer:  <br>  A.	Multi-terrain draw-bar tandem axle trailer for off road/emplacement operations.  <br>    <br>  B.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  <br>    <br>  	A.  Tower system shall be deployable to maximum height by two operators in a minimum of 30 minutes.  <br>    <br>  	B.  The vendor shall provide at minimum, one year return to manufacturer warranty and include telephone or internet support.  <br>  	C.  System should be natural aluminum or galvanized steel color in nature.  If any vendor submits a requirement to paint the system any other specific color to preserve metals/materials, the customer reserves the right to review available options and select color at time of contract award.  <br>  ===============================================================  <br>  Notices:  <br>  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision at 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors---Commercial, applies to this acquisition.

Therefore, the offeror's initial quote should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint.  Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your quote. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their quote. Request for such information does not constitute discussions.

The SAMHSA Government Project Officers have used and are familiar with this organization, its history, its marketing strategy, and specific expertise in reaching the audience needed for this conference at best value to the government. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span></strong><br />Since its inception, the National Association of Drug Court Professional (NADCP) has highlighted drug court programs which exhibit exemplary practice to serve as educational and training sites for the drug court and broader justice field and public through the Mentor Court Network. Continuing in this tradition, National Veterans' Treatment Mentor Courts (VTMC) serve as model court programs for individuals and court teams interested in seeing a well-functioning Veterans' Treatment Court (VTC) in action. Observing a VTC in action is critical to the learning curve of someone who is new to the model. In addition, the National VTC Mentor Court Network serves as a national "evaluation platform" for outcome studies on the model as well as for the development, identification, and testing of Veterans Treatment Court best practices. This new purchase order continues SAMHSA/CSATs program goal of providing training and information to current and potential treatment drug courts in order to improve their clinical interventions and to improve their overall effectiveness. This purchase order allows support for technical assistance, which includes on-site visits to these courts with experts in the field and court teams interested in learning about how to implement a court within their jurisdiction. This allows them the opportunity to visit an operational VTC. NADCP/NDCI is the contractor selected for this purchase order in order to maintain continuity of effort as this was the initial vendor who developed the application process for selecting the VTMC sites and developed the plans for technical assistance for other drug court sites to visit these courts.</p>
<p>This directly links to SAMHSA's Strategic Initiative on Trauma and Justice of reducing the pervasive, harmful, and costly health impact of violence and trauma by integrating trauma-informed approaches throughout health, behavioral health, and related systems and addressing the behavioral health needs of people involved in or at risk of involvement in the criminal and juvenile justice systems. <br />This services contract will provide training and information to current and potential treatment drug courts focusing on the veteran population in order to improve their clinical interventions and to improve their overall effectiveness. The tasks in this purchase order will allow SAMHSA/CSAT to use its expertise in criminal justice (specifically drug courts) and substance abuse treatment linkages to provide more knowledge to the field. Specifically, how to identify and serve military/veterans and deal with the multi-faceted issues that this group is facing upon returning to the U.S. from overseas assignments, often involving combat/war assignments. In the past few years, the interest in and funding of Veterans Courts has increased significantly. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:</span></strong></p>
<p>Renewal of direct services provision for SAMHSA with National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP); National Drug Court Institute (NDCI) for continuing support and expertise in providing knowledge, training and technical assistance and knowledge dissemination in the form of materials to the behavioral health field. This discrete services activity is a continuation of technical services provided by this vendor over the past three years. <br />This services contract will provide training and information to current and potential treatment drug courts in order to improve their clinical interventions and to improve their overall effectiveness. The tasks will allow SAMHSA/CSAT to use its expertise in criminal justice (specifically, drug courts) and substance abuse treatment linkages to provide more knowledge to the field; specifically, how to identify and serve military/veterans in order to deal with the multi-faceted issues this group is facing upon returning to the U.S. from overseas assignments, often involving combat/war assignments. <br /><br /><strong>Contractors possessing equal capabilities are encouraged to respond in writing no later than September 21th, 2013.</strong> All responses should provide at a minimum:<br /><br />1.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Title: <br /><br /></span></strong>Promoting Children's Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Health Forum<br />Solicitation#: 13-233-SOL-00529<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Date: <br /></span></strong><br />September 7, 2013</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Notice of Intent: </strong></span></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award a contract to support SAMHSA's efforts to establish a Forum on Promoting Children's Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Health (C-CAB Health Forum.) The Forum members and participants will engage in dialogue and discussion to connect the promotion, prevention, treatment, and implementation sciences with settings where children are seen and cared for, including primary health care, schools, preschools and child care, social service and child welfare, juvenile justice, family court, military, and community based organizations, and to create systems that are effective and affordable in addressing children's needs. <br />The National Academies was mandated by Congress in 1997 and consist of four organizations with The Institute of Medicine (IOM) being one. IOM is an internationally recognized and trusted resource for independent, expert advice related to health and medicine. Their reputation for independence and ability to bring together leading experts, weigh the evidence, and produce reports that inform sound policies, makes them a unique source for this type of expert review and consensus building. The IOM is uniquely positioned to be able to not only identify relevant partners and stakeholders but also garner their participation in the proposed activities because of their existing structures and established reputation. Because of their routine and continuous on-going engagement with a variety of high level healthcare stakeholder, they are in a unique position to meet the needs of this contract. <br />In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(;), competition is being restricted because The National Academies, Institute of Medicine is the only reasonable source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /><br /></span></strong>Research has demonstrated that almost half of Americans will meet one or more clinical criteria for mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders sometime in their life, with the first onset usually in childhood or adolescence (Kessler et al., 2005.) Lifetime prevalence may be as high as 37 percent by age 16 (Costello at al., 2003.) Such disorders convey a tremendous personal burden to the affected individuals and their families, as well as social costs to the broader community. One study has indicated that the national expenditures on mental health and substance abuse treatment for children and adolescents alone are almost $12 billion annually (Ringel and Sturm, 2001.) Another source has estimated the annual aggregate economic costs of services, health, and loss of productivity due to mental health and substance abuse disorders for individuals' ages 0-24 to be at least $247 billion per year (Eisenberg &amp; Neighbors, 2007.)<br /><br />The major findings of the National Research Council/Institute of Medicine report on the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders (Prevention of MEB; NRC/IOM 2009) and the report on parenting and depression (NCR/IOM, 2009), clearly identify a larger number of effective programs that could make major improvements in the mental and behavioral health of our country. They also address the importance of building public health infrastructure that will support states, communities and the nation in addressing mental, emotional and behavioral health through systematic approaches that include use of prevention science to inform broad population based strategies. Such prevention and intervention systems inform programs, coupled with effective treatments and delivery of services, form a solid scientific foundation on which to design and build new models for promotion and prevention systems including those that address environmental risk /protective factors as well as opportunities for delivering these programs to families, in schools, the military or the workplace, and through the health care and child welfare systems to improve outcomes for children and their families.<br /><br />In May, 2011, the NRC/IOM's Board on Children, Youth, and Families (BCYF) convened a multidisciplinary, multi-sectored group of representatives from fields as diverse as pediatrics, child psychiatry, public health, maternal and child health, neuroscience and human behavior, adolescent health and medicine, substance abuse, health care policy, child welfare, health insurance, psychology, developmental pediatrics, childcare, and social science research, to discuss integrating children's MEB health services into primary care settings. This meeting provided participants an opportunity to discuss integrating treatment and prevention services in multiple settings that see children and families on a regular basis. The C-CAB Health Forum will build off this group of stakeholders and add representatives from education, and possibly juvenile justice and the military.<br /><br />BCYF will use the C-CAB Health Forum to build off the momentum of the Prevention of MEB and the Parenting and Depression Reports, as well as the May, 2011 meeting. The establishment of the C-CAB Health Forum at this time is a critical next step to identifying opportunities for effective implementation solutions that to link the science to settings with multi-sectored stakeholders in the field of children's cognitive, affective, and behavioral health and to advance the knowledge of mental health promotion.<br /><br />In addition to the important national-level impacts that we are hoping this Forum will achieve, the work will also support important SAMHSA initiatives and priorities - specifically those related to Strategic Initiative for Prevention including priority areas of underage drinking, tobacco use, suicide prevention, and work to support military families. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description:<br /></span></strong><br />A major goal of the forum is to highlight and address gaps in the science of implementing programs and practices in the service of informing research, policy, and practice. One necessary component of addressing implementation science is knowledge utilization of the end user or decision maker, which can be at the local, state, or federal level. The Forum will address gaps in the science of implementation by convening a multi-sectoral group of representatives from academia, federal agencies, professional organizations, and philanthropy in an ongoing way. This group of forum members will decide on two workshop topics per year and work with the Academies staff to design the agendas and invite speakers and guests to participate. Workshops can be designed to engage the users of research from state and local agencies as well as intermediaries who translate research for legislators and service providers.<br /><br />Communications products such as one-page fact sheets, e-blasts, and online resources will be developed, and background papers will be commissioned for distribution at the workshops. Forum members will select the topics for the workshops, which are intended to inform future meetings of the forum.<br />The Forum membership will consist of researchers and representatives of: federal and state agencies; health, social service, and education providers; community-based organizations; professional societies; foundations; and consumer interest groups. <br /><br /><strong>The objectives of the forum are to:<br /></strong><br />&bull; Develop a workable plan to move an agenda on promoting children's cognitive,&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; affective, and behavioral health and implementation science forward, while keeping<br />&nbsp; an eye on what is not getting enough attention in this field.<br /><br />&bull; Identify and address gaps in implementation science.<br /><br />&bull; Identify topics for workshops and communications products (implementation tools<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;and measurement and/or program and systems implementation.)<br /><br />&bull; Work across sectors and systems, including businesses to get evidence-based<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;practices into settings where children and families are.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Date: <br /></span></strong><br />September 7, 2013</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Intent:<br /><br /></span></strong>The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) intends to award a contract to support SAMHSA's efforts to establish a Forum on Promoting Children's Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Health (C-CAB Health Forum.) This initiative will help SAMHSA address information gathered via a series of SAMHSA-sponsored listening forums that address negative attitudes and misconceptions, such as prejudice and discrimination, towards those in treatment and recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders. The prioritized issues of focus are HIV and the recovery workforce. To address these issues, messaging tools, strategies and resources for people in recovery will be developed. The messaging tools would be incorporated into Faces &amp; Voices existing recovery messaging and media training to develop a HIV webinar training as well as a Workforce webinar.. A HIV and a Workforce-specific "Questions and Answers" guide will be developed to assist advocates in strategically addressing issues of concern that are raised in efforts to locate services. This guide will assist recovery advocates in delivering effective information that promotes services as a bridge from treatment to sustained recovery. This level of informed advocacy will prove beneficial to the recovery community in that they will understand the breadth of HIV and Workforce issues in the recovery community and current public attitudes about it. Policymakers, the media, and other officials can then be engaged to raise awareness of the issues while also focusing in on possible solutions and best practices.<br /><br />In Accordance with FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1)(i) Faces &amp; Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) is the only responsible source because they are the only nationwide organization in the country that mobilizes tens of thousands of individuals and organizations from across the U.S. to advocate for policies and attitudes that will make recovery from substance abuse a reality for even more Americans. It is essential for SAMHSA to reach out to these individuals and organizations on a platform of this magnitude. FAVOR promotes long-term recovery and helps even more of our friends and neighbors overcome addiction by building a strong, organized recovery community. The recovery community is organizing around key priorities - to gain needed resources and to end discrimination against people in or seeking long-term recovery. The organization supports local, state and regional recovery community organizations and helps them raise their profile at the national level. These webinars are a continuation on youth housing support, which will increase knowledge and educate participants on public attitudes about: the relation between recovery and HIV: and about the recovery workforce experience. These areas were identified through a series of SAMHSA-sponsored listening forums that addressed negative attitudes and misconceptions, such as prejudice and discrimination, towards those in treatment and recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:<br /></span></strong><br />A need exists for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (SAMHSA/CSAT) to develop initiatives that help promote recovery and social inclusion for those individuals in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Barriers, like discrimination and prejudice, present a problem in the United States that affect policies and attitudes towards the recovery community. According to a comprehensive survey of the general public on stigma conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and Robert M. Teeter's Coldwater Corporation, two thirds of the public interviewed believed that a stigma exists toward people in recovery, with stigma was defined as "something that detracts from the character or reputation of a person, a mark of disgrace." Similarly, 80 percent of the people surveyed said that discrimination in the workplace and that the availability of health insurance for people seeking recovery is an issue in the United States.</p>
<p>Individuals' perception of recovery, as well as their negative attitudes and misconceptions, play a major role in their decision as to whether or not to seek treatment. This is especially true for young people in recovery for substance use disorders in comparison to their adult counterparts. Young people in recovery describe prejudice and discrimination in recovery community situations, where older people in recovery devalued them as too young to experience addiction or need recovery and dismissed their substance use experiences as developmental or growing-up issues. It is important for young people to feel validated in their lived recovery experiences and be able to express that not only to adults, but also to the public as well as their peers in recovery. This further alludes to the need for effective messaging for people in recovery not just around prejudice and discrimination, but also around specific policy issues. Housing and recovery residences, for example, are one of the frontline policy issues that can significantly affect whether an individual seeks and maintains long-term recovery. Across the country, proposals to locate recovery residences and treatment facilities frequently come up against opposition to safe, stable and drug-free homes and residences. Community opposition can be one of the greatest challenges organizations face as they work to establish services for people that are considered "threatening." "Not in My Back Yard" - commonly referred to as NIMBY - opposition can result in significant program delays, public and often hostile debate, and even failure to open desperately needed residences for people in early recovery from addiction to alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description of work:<br /></span></strong><br />The awarded contractor will host four (4) two-hour webinars to specifically address the issue of people with HIV in recovery as well as the recovery workforce to dispel the negative attitudes and misconception issues pursuant to those individuals recovering from mental and/or substance use disorders. Additionally, messaging tools, strategies and resources for people with HIV in recovery and those in the recovery workforce and advocates for recovery workforce will be developed.</p>
<p>The contractor should submit contract plan within 30 days of award of contract, and develop a series of outreach materials that will be used and explained throughout all of the webinars. Contractor will conduct a total of at least four (4) two-hour webinars on both people with HIV in recovery and the recovery workforce. The contractor shall utilize the web and other outreach efforts to engage a widespread number of individuals, community members, and organizations to elicit their attendance at the webinar sessions. Contractor shall compile all information gathered from each webinar and draft an authoritative report, or "white paper." This document must address, but is not limited to: (a) a literature review, (b) issues encountered, (c) major findings, (d) trends as well as (e) observations and recommendations for reducing misconceptions and negative attitudes towards those in recovery. Observations and recommendation should be highlighted using the most appropriate categories, i.e. division of environments, age groups, genders, etc.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solicitation#: <br /></span></strong><br />13-233-SOL-00531</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Date: <br /></span></strong><br />September 7, 2013</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Notice of Intent:<br /><br /></span></strong>The Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) plans to gain an understanding of attitudes and perceptions of mental health stigma of the general public. This will provide a fifth year of information and findings related to the subject matter and will provide a continuing platform for future surveys, analysis and reporting. The overarching objective of this project is to accomplish the following. Obtain a dataset of the results from the 2010 HealthStyles Survey related to the variables addressing mental illness stigma and the associated demographics. <br />In Accordance with 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1 (b)(1)(i) Porter Novelli is the only responsible source that will satisfy agency requirements. Porter Novelli is the proprietary owner of the HealthStyles Survey and Database that will be utilized within this project, therefore, no other source will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed work builds on a variety of topics that are of high interest and this data is made available through licensing which is of exclusive use and isn't licensed to any other organization. The survey conducted by Porter Novelli in 2006 and subsequent years through a similar contract, it is critical for mission success that this source again be used. The 2006 survey results provided a baseline of information, and the proposed work of this project will continue to build on that baseline. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p>The 1999 U.S. Surgeon General's report on mental health revealed that stigma has largely contributed to an "unwarranted sense of hopelessness about the opportunities for recovery from mental illness," and that "stigma surrounding the receipt of mental health treatment is among the many barriers that discourage people from seeking care."</p>
<p>The final report of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health identifies stigma as one of the most pervasive barriers "to understanding the gravity of mental illnesses and the importance of mental health." The report indicates that stigma is widespread in the United States and states the following.</p>
<p><br />[Stigma is] a cluster of negative attitudes and beliefs that motivate the general public to fear, reject, avoid, and discriminate against people with mental illnesses. Stigma leads others to avoid living, socializing, or working with, renting to, or employing people with mental disorders - especially severe disorders, such as schizophrenia. It leads to low self-esteem, isolation, and hopelessness. It deters the public from seeking and wanting to pay for care. Responding to stigma, people with mental health problems internalize public attitudes and become so embarrassed or ashamed that they often conceal symptoms and fail to seek treatment.</p>
<p>In general, stigmatization and discrimination contribute to the economic poverty and social isolation of many mental health consumers. Such attitudes have a substantial impact on everything from mental health care penetration rates to support for public mental health services.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services'(CMHS) has undertaken many efforts to address stigma and discrimination associated with mental illnesses. In March 2000, CMHS convened a national mental health symposium to address discrimination and stigma. The symposium offered an opportunity to learn what works and what does not work on this issue, how exemplary practices can be disseminated and replicated, and what it would take to implement a national endeavor.</p>
<p>The HealthStyles survey, conducted annually since 1995 by Porter Novelli with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) support, provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine perceptions of stigma of the general public to assist SAMHSA in assessing the effect of its anti-stigma efforts, particularly the national campaign. The HealthStyles survey, a comprehensive look at the American public's health orientations and practices, assesses people's attitudes and beliefs about chronic and infectious diseases and behaviors, exposure to health information and communication campaigns, and self-reported symptoms, diseases and disorders.</p>
<p>In order to get a baseline of data about public perceptions in the United States before the launch of the Campaign for Mental Health Recovery, CMHS placed six questions in the 2006 HealthStyles survey related to assessing the burden of mental illness stigma. The survey was fielded to 6,000 persons annually that results in a sample size of about 4,100 persons. This original survey provided baseline data for the CMHR, and it has been repeated yearly yielding valuable information about the impact of the campaign on public perceptions.</p>
<p>This proposed project builds on the findings of the first three years of the survey. It will fund a fifth year of the survey and provide the opportunity to continue assessment of the impact of the national campaign. The survey is a proprietary product of Porter Novelli. CMHS anticipates licensing the data set from Porter Novelli, minus personal identifying information, for internal use upon completion of the survey. The proposed project allows CMHS programs to provide input into development of important public health data, provides timely access to specific communication planning data, and requires minimal resources for the data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION:</span></strong></p>
<p>This project plans to gain an understanding of attitudes and perceptions of mental health stigma of the general public. This will provide a fifth year of information and findings related to the subject matter and will provide a continuing platform for future surveys, analysis and reporting. The overarching objective of this project is to obtain a dataset of the results from the 2010 HealthStyles Survey related to the variables addressing mental illness stigma and the associated demographics. <br />Porter Novelli Washington, D.C. Strategic Planning and Research Department is the proprietary owner of the HealthStyles database and is responsible for conducting the HealthStyles survey. SAMHSA will enter into an Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement with Porter Novelli for access to certain licensed items of the database. The dataset produced under this project, according to the terms of the licensing agreement, can only be used internally by SAMHSA. SAMHSA may share reports derived from the data and publish the results of analyses of the data.</p>
