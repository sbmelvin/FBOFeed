<DESC><strong>Note: FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT.</strong>
<p>This project will provide hot mix asphalt concrete pavement (HMAC) to patches of road which were washed out with the 2010 Flood Event on National Forest System Road 39 (Hells Canyon Scenic Byway). These sections of road were repaired via a Federal Highway Administration contract in the fall of 2010, but were left in an aggregate surface condition. Project activities are located in thirteen sections of road and will include removal and disposal of approximately 3" of the top crushed aggregate surfacing (retaining enough material to replace the shoulder rock), and replacing this material with 3" of HMAC. All associated work such as preparatory work, placement of tack coat, haul, processing, compacting of HMAC and shoulder rock, and any brooming or cleanup work is considered indirect to the placement of the HMAC. Contractor shall be required to provide temporary traffic control during his construction operations.</p>
<p>The project is located approximately 20 miles east of Halfway, OR on NFSR 39 (Hells Canyon Scenic Byway and All-American road). The project begins just south of the junction of Lake Fork Campground road (MP 40.78) and ends at MP 47.25, approximately 1.4 miles north of the junction with Oregon State Highway 86.</p>
<p>This project is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>

The project will consist of removal of an existing bottomless arch and its footings, placing or casting new footings, installing the new plate arch culvert, rehabilitation of approximately 150' of streambed, and rebuilding the road to pre-flood elevations. Two material sources are identified in the plans. The in-water work window is July 1 to August 31.</p>
<p>The project is located in Baker County, OR approximately 10 miles north of Halfway, OR (T7S, R45E, NW &frac14; of Section 4). There are two separate routes which may be used to access the project site (see plans sheet 2 of 8 for a vicinity map). From Halfway take State 413 (Cornucopia Highway) to County 1009 (Fish Lake Rd.). Turn left on County 999 (Clear Creek Rd.). County 999 will eventually become FSR 66. The site is located approximately 6.5 miles after turning onto County 999. Alternatively, stay on County 1009 (it becomes East Pine Creek Rd. at the Jct. of County 999). County 1009 eventually becomes FSR 6625 and dead ends at FSR 66. Turn left on FSR 66. The project site is about 0.25 mi from Junction of 66 and 6625.<br /><br />This project is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>

8.  Provide one year warranty on labor and parts.

4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).

RATIONALE SUPPORTING USE OF AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE:  The installation alarm system is a closed secured system that provides coverage for all of the facilities on the installation to include Bio-security laboratories and Secured Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIF). These facilities contain a range of items from supplies, drugs, research data, Top Secret information, unclassified information, and information vital to National Security, within their walls. The alarm system in use is ICIDS and it is mandated and sanctioned in order by the Intrusion Detection Security Working Group (IDSWG) to the Physical Security Equipment Working Group (PSEWG) to the Army Physical Security Equipment Action Group (APSEAG) up to the Office of the Provost Marshal General (OPMG) where it was sanctioned and accepted by the Department of Defense (DoD) as the standardized DoD Intrusion Detection System. No other IDS/alarm system or devices can be tied into this closed looped alarm system, all of which terminates at the Installation Provost Marshal Office who has the responsibility for monitoring and responding to all activated alarms.
        Due to the proprietary control over the components of this security system, there are a limited number of companies that are certified and trusted with the capability of installing, maintaining and servicing the alarm system.

5.  DETERMINATION OF FAIR & REASONABLE COSTS:  The negotiated price of $198802.83 has been determined to be fair and reasonable, since we have an estimate of $207359.45, and exceeds the contractor's price, so the cost is therefore fair and reasonable.

6.  MARKET SURVEY:  A market survey was not conducted.

7.  Additional Support:  None

8.  OTHER INTERESTED SOURCES:  Expressed interest, but do not have the qualifications and access approval to Fort Detrick. 

9.  FUTURE COMPETITIVE PLAN:  N/A

Technical Certification

I certify that the facts and representations are under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and for a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate and meet the minimum needs and schedule requirements.

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Objective:</strong></p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has a need to procure services to provide technical assistance to states that are seeking to adopt the Model National Standards for Entry-Level Motorcycle Rider Training, track the number of States that have adopted the Model National Standards for Entry-Level Motorcycle Rider Training, and determine the feasibility of establishing a certification/accreditation process for entry-level motorcycle rider training curricula and/or programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
<p>NHTSA's mission is to save lives, prevent injuries and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. The agency develops, promotes and implements effective educational, engineering and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 495.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;As early as 1968, NHTSA identified the license process as a primary measurable countermeasure that could reduce motorcycle fatalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Key to that process was training and testing to ensure motorcycle riders possessed the basic skills and knowledge needed to safely operate a motorcycle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 495.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;In 1973, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) published The Beginning Rider Course that, at that time, contained <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">"what is presently known about motorcycle operation."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 495.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;Starting in 1974 and continuing through 1979, research projects led to the MSF Motorcycle RiderCourse which was introduced in 1975 and finalized in 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Combined with refinements in methodology by MSF to further enhance the course, the course received a new name in 1985; Motorcycle RiderCourse: <em>Riding and Street Skills </em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">(MRC:RSS)</span>. However, the application of the Curriculum Specifications and other research remained unchanged. The MRC:RSS was used almost exclusively throughout the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 495.0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;In August 2005, a motorcycle safety grant program was authorized by Congress to provide funding to States for the improvement of rider training programs and the conduct of motorist awareness activities with the enactment of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>An eligible use of this grant program's funding, based upon the language in the Final Rule for the grant program, included, "Improvements to motorcyclist safety training curricula," which could be interpreted as providing States with grant funding to develop their own rider training curricula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2008, NHTSA began work on the development of Model National Standards for Entry-Level Motorcycle Rider Training (hereinafter referred to as "the Standards").<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent of the standards is to serve as a model for all entry-level motorcycle rider training curricula developed and offered in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The standards are being developed with input from an Expert Working Group on the minimum standards needed for entry-level rider training.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In 2011, NHTSA will publish the Model National Standards for Entry-Level Rider Training and begin the development of Model Motorcycle Rider Training Program Administrative Standards, which shall be published in 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Specifically, the contractor shall:</p>

<p>&bull; Collect the following data over an 18-month period from "permit" to 6 months after provisional (independent driving) licensure: amount of supervised practice; routes, locations, and distances traveled; instruction provided by adult supervisors; crashes and near crashes; g-force events; secondary task engagement; and driving performance in complex driving conditions such as when merging or dealing with intersections;</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain high quality data collection and subject retention;</p>
<p>&bull; Employ standardized procedures within a secure environment to reduce and code the data for analysis;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze teen driving exposure and performance, including skill, judgment, attention, g-force events, and crashes and near crashes; compare teen and parent driving performance;</p>
<p>&bull; Compare driving performance among youth from different school districts with varied supervised practice driving experience;</p>
<p>&bull; Compare the data to similar data collected by VTTI with other funding;</p>
<p>&bull; Store the collected data and maintain its confidentiality.</p>
<p><br />The proposed work would provide new information about important research questions that have implications for behavioral, technical, and policy interventions to reduce crashes among young drivers.</p>
<p>The contractor is uniquely qualified by virtue of its continued performance and is the only source that can provide the data for the following reasons: Under the existing contract VTTI has begun recruiting and instrumenting the vehicles of the 100 teenagers and their parents. VTTI developed the technology that is being used for these studies and only VTTI has the capacity for standardized, validated, and confidential data coding and reduction procedures for assessing driving performance, risk, and crash/near crash events.</p>
<p>The unique qualifications of the contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1) This research involves the collection of massive amounts of data too large to transfer. The data are stored electronically in a structure built for this purpose at the VTTI with elaborate data security provisions.</p>
<p>2) VTTI is the proprietary owner of the vehicle instrumentation used to collect the data and is uniquely qualified to code, reduce, and analyze the data.</p>
<p>3) VTTI has developed unique, standard coding and data reduction procedures for the naturalistic data collected, including video footage and accelerometer data.</p>
<p>4) VTTI has developed standard training procedures for complex data reduction.</p>
<p>5) The data are highly confidential, given the use of cameras in the vehicle and could not ethically be made available to other researchers before the data were reduced and subject confidentiality could be assured. The data reduction laboratory provides unique data confidentiality procedures.</p>
<p>No other contractor can meet all of the following requirements:</p>
<p>A. Recruit teenagers and parents for naturalistic studies involving driving data acquisition systems;</p>
<p>B. Maintain a cohort of teenage and parent participants over the course of at least 12 months;</p>
<p>C. Obtain a supply of at least 100 data acquisition systems for continuous recording of data from at least the following components: accelerometers; global positioning systems; four cameras that can view the drivers', the vehicle cabin and the forward and rearward roadway; audio recording; connection to the vehicles ODP port; and a CPU that can be installed in the vehicle to store the captured data;</p>
<p>D. Staffing, training, experience, and quality control for installing driving data acquisition systems in any vehicle within 3 hours;</p>
<p>E. Mechanisms and procedures for downloading from vehicles data from driving data acquisition systems;</p>
<p>F. Storage capacity of at least 100 terabytes for the naturalistic driving data; and</p>
<p>G. Trained and experienced staff and a secure laboratory for coding and reducing large amounts of naturalistic data for use in analyses of crashes and near crashes, g-force event rates, and driving exposure and performance.</p>
<p>To obtain the proposed data from a contractor other than VTTI, the government would need to (1) fund a full observational study that would cost millions of dollars and take many years and be highly duplicative; or (2) contract with an offeror that would subcontract with VTTI to provide data collection, coding, reduction and analyses, resulting in much higher costs to the government. <br /><br />While the government has unlimited data rights, it is not feasible for the government to take control of data storage, given its size and security requirements. If another offeror were awarded a contract for this work, they would need to subcontract with VTTI to gain access to the stored data, would need to develop coding, reduction, and analytic procedures that would be duplicative of costs and work already paid for by the existing contract with VTTI and would be redundant, time consuming, and expensive. However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they may submit, within 30 days of publication of this notice, two (2) copies of a capability statement (no more than five (5) pages), which will be considered by this agency to: Janet Glazer, Contract Specialist, NICHD, CMB, NIH, 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7510 (or overnight/express/courier service: 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Rockville, MD 20852), plus an electronic copy to glazerjl@mail.nih.gov.

Please limit responses to five (5) pages or less. Any proprietary information should be so marked.

<SUBJECT>J--INLS Side Connector Overhaul and Repair
<SOLNBR>N0002511R0001
<RESPDATE>053111
<ARCHDATE>05312011
<CONTACT>Michael Fanizzo Jr. (202) 685 6017
<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Sealift Support Program Office (SSPO) has a requirement for the overhaul and repair of Side Connectors, Remote Hydraulic Carts and 8ft X 8ft X 20ft ISO 668 Containers. The overhaul and repair will take place at the contractor's facility. 

The Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) Side Connector System consists of two major assemblies: the INLS Side Connector and the Remote Hydraulic Cart. The main purpose of the connector is to provide a means of connecting INLS Combination Modules (CMs) side-by-side to form a rigid connection. The connectors mate with female pockets located on the side of each CM when engaged. The connectors are designed to be capable of operation through Sea State 2 and survive in Sea State 4.

The connector is a two-trapezoidal box structure which houses four bullets at top and four at bottom for connection.
 These eight bullets work in pairs and are moved inward or outward by hydraulic cylinders with control connections at the top of the connector. Each bullet engages with a female socket that conforms to the shape of the bullet. Female sockets are cast in the CMs. The objective is to use four side connectors to hold two CMs together side-to-side. For each connector, all eight bullets engage the female sockets forming a rigid joint. The hydraulic power is supplied via flexible quick disconnect hoses that connect to the top of each connector. 

The Remote Hydraulic Cart provides the means to hydraulically power and electrically monitor the connector operation. The cart receives 2500 psi hydraulic pressure from a separate hydraulic power unit to a hose connection into the back of the cart.
 Electrical power (24 VDC) is provided via a generator located in the crew shelter and cabling into the back of the cart.

The wheeled cart houses a mobile multifaster, remote control station, electrical interface box, manifold assembly, gage panel and floodlight. The mobile multifaster is designed to mate with the hydraulic and electrical connections on the connector's fixed multifaster. The remote control station contains the operator controls and indicators for operation of the connector. The remote control station is operated via a hand held tethered remote. The manifold has five solenoid operated valves (one for circulation of fluid and four for supply/return to the connector cylinders).
 The gauge panel is provided with four pressure gauges, one for each of the side connector lines.

The electrical interface box is mounted on the rear side of the cart. The box provides connections for the incoming hydraulic and electrical power. Also contained in the box is a programmable relay module that receives inputs from the side connector cylinder sensors and the remote control station, and provides outputs to the solenoid valves and the remote control station status indicators. The electrical interface box also contains a proportional valve controller module that receives inputs from the remote control station operator control, and outputs to the hydraulic proportional valve that is located with the Hydraulic Power Unit (HPU).

One INLS ship-set, 20 connectors and two carts, are shipped and stored in three 20-foot long ISO containers.
 The containers contain pallets, strapping material and safety chains required to keep the connectors secure while in transit. The ISO containers can be shipped via commercial means. 

Principle features of the work will include the following: 

Side Connectors:

- Unload 20 connectors, each weighing 4760 lbs, out of the ISO containers.
- Electrically, hydraulically, mechanically test connectors.
- Repair/Replace items as necessary on connectors.
- Brush blast entire assembly then repaint.
- Create label plates out of Stainless Steel and affix to connectors.
- Machine eight bullets per connector on lathe to meet dimensional requirements.

ISO Containers:

- ISO containers shall be inspected for conformance to ABS rules of certification for cargo containers.
- Examine for any missing lashing hardware in the ISO Containers.
- Examine for rust/holes in ISO Containers.
- Repair and Repaint ISO containers as necessary.
 

Remote Hydraulic Carts:
- Electrically, hydraulically, mechanically test remote hydraulic carts.
- Repair/Replace items as necessary remote hydraulic carts.
- Repaint remote hydraulic carts as necessary.

The contractor shall establish storage space for depot level material and three ISO containers at their facility during the length of the contract. The Government will access these materials and containers as needed.

The solicitation will include indefinite-delivery-indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) and option line items. These will cover configuration changes and fabrication of new connectors and carts, as well as, overhaul and repair services for additional connectors, carts, and containers.
 Only equipment loss will trigger the award of the fabrication line items. Options for services for additional connectors, carts, and containers will be executed only if funds are available. Configuration changes will be IDIQ and awarded when required by the Government.

This is a new procurement; it does not replace an existing contract. 

Offerors will be able to view/ download the solicitation at https://www.neco.navy.mil/ when it is posted.

When the solicitation is released, offerors may email requests to michael.fanizzo@navy.mil to receive a copy of the technical package.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to VJ Technologies, 89 Carlough Rd, Bohemia, NY 11716 for non-destructive digital x-ray inspection of 116 each Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) lightweight armor (LWA) panels at Assault Craft Unit Five  (ACU-5) onboard Camp Pendleton, CA.  The order will contain an option to x-ray an additional 290 LWA panels at ACU-4 onboard the Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek, VA.  VJ Technologies developed proprietary unique software capable of identifying cracks in the LCAC armor panels.  This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the current inspection requirement as it would add significant testing cost and time delays required to develop alternative software that would not be recoverable through competition.
  Therefore, it is in the Governments best interest to purchase non-destructive digital X-Ray inspection services from VJ Technologies for this requirement.  Interested Contractors may submit their interest and capability to the agency point of contact at: tim.e.reed1@navy.mil.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center  Panama City, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Pacific Star Communications, Inc, on a sole source basis for the acquisition of one (1) each part number IQC-SW IQ-CoreTM.  PacStar IQ-Core supports the monitoring and configuration of hardware and software devices currently existing within the target system.  PacStar IQ-Core is currently fielded with the target system.

Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.
  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to HTX Technologies LLC., P.O. Box 1036, Carrboro, NC 27510 for the acquisition of a HTX Technologies TM-Sprayer platform. The HTX Technologies TM-Sprayer platform reproducibly and uniformly sprays matrix solution onto thin tissue slices for mass spectrometry imaging. The new technology created by HTX Technologies is proprietary and patented, as it uses new controlled gas flow and digital technology to control the reproducibility of the spray pattern, which directly relates to improved data quality control.  When coupled with mass spectrometry this instrument will provide for greater sensitivity, reproducibility and resolution of peptides and proteins in thin tissue samples which will have a direct positive impact on the quality assurance of the research. EPA has identified HTX Technologies, the only vendor capable of satisfy the requi rement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.301-1, ?only one responsible source?. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 10 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement only, and no contract will be awarded based on responses to this announcement.
<p>SYNOPSIS: The US Coast Guard (USCG) seeks to award one contract for the procurement of a commercially off the shelf (COTS), suitable and proven Electronic Flight Display System (EFDS) for the USCG HC-130H Avionics I Upgrade (A1U) Project. This contract will consist of a two-year base and three (3) one-year option periods, not to exceed a total of five years. The base period will consist of a firm fixed price NRE effort and the purchase of approximately 3 ship sets to be installed in prototype aircraft and a System Integration Lab. The option periods will be for EFDS ship sets for approximately 15 fleet aircraft plus approximately 2 ship sets for USCG initial sparing. The exact numbers of ship sets ordered during each option period will be estimates contingent on funding. Select Engineering and Technical Support Services during the base and each option period may be ordered by labor hour. This requirement will be satisfied by using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12 and negotiated procedures specified in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The USCG HC-130H long range surveillance maritime patrol aircraft is undergoing a series of upgrades to enable the continued effective and safe operation of the HC-130H through the year 2027. The first group of avionics upgrades (i.e. A1U) addresses critical modernization issues including internationally mandated Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements, flight safety, mission performance, interoperability, component obsolescence and related mission availability concerns. The USCG Aviation Acquisitions Program Office (CG-931) is utilizing the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Manager Air, Air Combat Electronics program office (PMA 209), as the Integrating Agent for the A1U project. The A1U project has completed the system requirements definition, system functions allocation, and initial design development, and has finalized the system level technical architecture. The A1U technical architecture is based upon CNS/ATM architectures developed by joint PMA 209 / contractor teams for the Navy's P-3C, C2A, E-2, and the Marine Corps CH-53 aircraft. Incorporating this A1U architecture into the HC-130H host requires subsystem additions, replacements, removals and applicable modifications to the host platform systems and interfaces. The A1U architecture will integrate and manage different hardware/ software systems &amp; equipment, most of which have not been previously employed in the HC-130H. This technical architecture includes the following major A1U subsystems described by function: Flight Management System (FMS); Navigation System; Autopilot System; Communications System; Identification &amp; Surveillance System; and Electronic Flight information Displays System (EFDS). The Flight Management System (FMS) will use the CDU-7000 (proven successful for Navy, USCG, and Army avionics upgrade projects) to control all data and information flow to and from the EFDS components. The EFDS subsystems will contain digital "glass cockpit" integrated flat panel displays (aka multifunction displays), their data processors, a Caution Warning &amp; Advisory Panel (CWAP), an Electronic Chart Server, associated Display Control Panels (DCPs) and Hand Controllers.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: The party must provide and demonstrate a suitable, proven, high quality, readily producible &amp; supportable COTS EFDS that fits into and works with the current A1U design and HC-130H legacy systems. The party will need to perform non recurring engineering, technical, integrated logistics, manufacturing, subcontract and overall EFDS project management tasks, to successfully integrate a suitable, proven EFDS product for the USCG HC-130H Avionics I Upgrade (A1U) - to include providing associated functional integration and A1U system level testing and demonstration assets and their support. This EFDS work effort will require close technical coordination and cooperation with other key A1U contractors. This EFDS effort will also include creating and providing to the USCG the EFDS familiarization training and the EFDS engineering and associated integrated logistics and manufacturing technical data (drawings, manuals, etc).</p>
<p>USCG TOP LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>A. A proposed EFDS will readily accommodate the existing physical, functional, and information processing and display requirements for the A1U system and its discrete subsystems. This includes providing/integrating all hardware, software and interface modifications needed to meet the applicable CNS/ATM exhibition and other performance requirements of the EFDS such as:</p>
<p>- Display of Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation (RNP RNAV) data.<br />- Display of required Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro VNAV) data.<br />- Display of communication radio data.<br />- Display of dual Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) data.<br />- Display of dual ARN-118 TACAN, dual ARN-123 VOR, ARN-149, and DF-430 data.<br />- Display of Digital Video/Imagery.<br />- Control and display of digital mapControl and display of electronic chart data.<br />- Display of Terrain Avoidance &amp; Warning System (TAWS) data.<br />- Display of Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) data.</p>
<p>The system must also have growth capability to meet the following future requirements:</p>
<p>- Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS).<br />- Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).<br />- Display of flight director data.</p>
<p><br />B. A proposed EFDS will be based on avionics COTS components readily available and certifiable for installation and integration into commercial and military aircraft.</p>
<p>C. Interested parties should be advised that within 30 days after contract award that they must participate and support a Subsystem Technical Review to ensure the system can proceed into detailed design, and can meet the stated performance requirements within cost, schedule, risk and other system constraints. A Critical Design Review will be convened 90 days after contract award, followed shortly thereafter by an Installation Readiness Review and then the initiation of the A1U modification efforts to the prototype aircraft.</p>
<p>Replies:</p>
<p>Offerors may express interest by emailing Mr. Danny Sawyer, Contracting Officer, at Danny.R.Sawyer@uscg.mil. Request each offeror provide cage code and mailing address.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business); and (2) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>CMS is looking for, but not limiting to, small businesses that are currently on a FWAC or GSA Schedule, have experience in the commercial health insurance industry and Medicare as well as knowledge of Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) was established by section 1102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted on March 23, 2010. Congress appropriated $5 billion for this temporary program and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to set the program within 90 days of enactment. Accordingly, HHS published an Interim Final Rule to implement the ERRP on May 5 with an effective date of June 1, 2010, and the program began accepting applications on June 29, 2010. The ERRP is scheduled to end no later than January 1, 2014 and will serve as a bridge to the new health insurance marketplace to be established through State-based Health Insurance Exchanges in 2014.</p>
<p>The ERRP was designed to provide financial assistance for health plan sponsors-including for-profit companies, schools and other education institutions, unions, State and local governments, religious organizations and other non-profits-to help early retirees and their families continue to have access to quality, affordable health coverage. People in the early retiree age group (i.e., ages 55 to 65) often face difficulties obtaining insurance in the individual market because of age or chronic conditions that make coverage unaffordable and inaccessible. The ERRP provides needed financial help to group health plans that provide health coverage to retirees and their families, who depend on the coverage for their health care needs. The ERRP reimburses participating plan sponsors for a portion of the costs of providing health coverage to early retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses, and dependents.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this notice is to seek out small businesses interested in performing certain requirements that will support the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP).</p>

Notices to plan participants indicating participation in ERRP</p>
<p>&bull; Perform detailed audits of health insurance claims data, plan enrollment information, and price concessions data (e.g. rebates) submitted by plan sponsors for the purpose of receiving reimbursement for high dollar healthcare claims through the RRP. Audits may include travel to plan sponsor locations throughout the country.<br />&bull; Review and audit plan sponsors use of received ERRP reimbursements.<br />&bull; Answer questions and concerns from plan sponsors in response to ERRP payment adjustments indentified through audits and analysis of their claims, price concession, enrollment, program reimbursement and program fund usage.<br />&bull; Conduct quality assurance and continuous improvement processes.</p>

<p>CMS is looking for, but not limiting to, small businesses that are currently on a GWAC or GSA Schedule, have experience in the commercial health insurance industry and Medicare as well as knowledge of Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 11-148), hereafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Recovery Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152). Section 1101 of the Affordable Care Act establishes a "temporary high risk health insurance pool program" (which has been named the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, or PCIP) to provide health insurance coverage to currently uninsured individuals with pre-existing conditions. The Affordable Care Act authorizes HHS to carry out the program directly or through contracts with States or private, nonprofit entities. The PCIP program is intended to remain in place from the time of its establishment until the Exchanges established under Sections 1311 or 1321 of the Act go into effect on January 1, 2014.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this notice is to seek out small businesses interested in performing certain requirements that will support the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP).</p>

<p><br />FOOD AND NUTRITION SERVICES (FNS) ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD NUTRITION DIVISION Recipes for Healthy Kids Competition RECIPE STANDARDIZATION PROJECT</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.</p>
<p>The USDA Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services mission area works to harness the Nation's agricultural abundance to end hunger and improve health in the United States. Its agencies administer federal domestic nutrition assistance programs, and link scientific research to the nutrition needs of consumers through science-based dietary guidance, nutrition policy coordination, and nutrition education. The mission of FNS is to provide children and needy families' better access to food and a more healthful diet through its food assistance programs and comprehensive nutrition education efforts.<br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) seeks a qualified contractor team for the preparing, testing, revising, standardizing, photographing, and formatting of the top 30 recipes submitted to FNS's Recipes for Healthy Kids (R4HK) Competition. Upon successful completion of the initial 30 recipes there is an option for an additional 70 recipes (100 total) to be completed at a future date. <br />Let's Move!, in association with the USDA, challenged school nutrition professionals, chefs, students, parents and interested community members to create tasty, healthy, exciting new recipes for inclusion on school lunch menus across the country through the Recipes for Healthy Kids (R4HK) Competition.<br />Contestants formed teams, developed, documented, and prepared at least one healthy recipe in one of three categories (Whole Grains, Dark Green and Orange Vegetables, or Dry Beans and Peas). Their creations were served in the school's cafeteria, and rated by students. The top five recipes in each category were posted for online voting by the public to determine a Popular Choice Winner. These recipes and the 15 runner-up recipes (total 30) will be standardized for use in homes and Child Nutrition Programs and formatted with photos for publication. As an option at a future date, additional recipes (up to 70) will require standardization and formatting.<br />The recipes generated by the competition will require recalculation and revision for use in the Child Nutrition Programs. These programs receive federal funds based on meeting the meal pattern requirements established for the individual programs. As a result, all 30 recipes (with the option for an additional 70 in the future) will require preparing, testing, and revision to assure accuracy in standardization and in contributions made toward meal pattern requirements. <br />FNS will contract for the revision and standardization and in some instances the modification of these recipes to meet the USDA recommendations on fat, sugar, and sodium in the diet and in contributions made to meal pattern requirements. The project must be conducted following the work plan and in the time period negotiated by the contractor and FNS. The project completion date is August 31, 2011</p>
<p>The overall objective for the R4HK Competition Recipe Standardization project acquisition is to procure services for preparing, testing, revising, standardizing, photographing, and formatting of the top 30 recipes from the R4HK Competition. The completed recipes are for use in the Child Nutrition Programs. Upon completion of this project FNS will publish the recipes into a recipe book for schools and a recipe book for families. <br />Using that information as a baseline, the following must be met: <br />1.1 Fulfill FNS requirements to revise, prepare, evaluate, modify, and standardize for 6, 25, 50, and 100 servings the recipes provided by FNS.<br />1.2 Format each recipe using provided templates; 6 servings, 25 and 50 servings, 50 and 100 servings. <br />1.3 Take professional-quality photographs of each recipe according to USDA requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Marine Fisheries Service, (NMFS) in Miami, FL , acquires services the University of south Carolina for using massively parallel DNA Sequencing to Characterize complex Mixtures of Fish Eggs. Massively parallel DNA sequencing is the &lsquo;next' generation sequencing technology that currently promises hundreds of megabases of DNA sequence per reaction. Small fragments are generally characterized from a single genome (currently ~ 400 bp), and then assembled into a series of over-lapping fragments representing the entire genome under investigation. Recent modifications to this basic technique have allowed the possibility to sequence small fragments from hundreds of individuals rather than hundreds of fragments from a single individual. The technique uses 'barcodes' or short oligonucleotide tags that uniquely define individuals. In the current context, individuals would represent unique collections of fish eggs, and fragments would represent small DNA sequences that carry mutations unique to each species in the sample. DNA would be isolated from all eggs within a sample, this DNA would be used as template to amplify a diagnostic locus whose information content could identify individual species in the collection, and the resulting count of sequences unique to each species representative of the number of individual eggs that can be assigned to each species. For this approach to work, an assay that targets a locus with sufficient discriminatory power to define species and that has available a large database of sequences from voucher specimens is necessary. The University of South Carolina is the only known source that has on hand hundreds of sequences representing many fishes found in the Gulf of Mexico, including tunas, billfishes, snappers and groupers; these species have been characterized with a hort section of the mitochondrial DNA 16s rRNA locus. This locus will be used to characterize eggs to species where feasible and sequence information is available. <br />Description of Work:<br />Oligonucleotides will be &lsquo;labeled' with unique barcode sequences defining each sample of eggs and used to amplify individual 16s rRNA sequences from 800 selected eggs from the entire CUFES sample (40 individual samples, 20 eggs per sample = 800 total). Each individual will be sequenced in its entirety, then characterized and matched against current snapper/grouper databases or used in BLAST searches against sequences in GenBank. These sequences will form the basis for &lsquo;proof of concept' of massively parallel DNA sequencing. Two complementary approaches will be taken. First, 16s rRNA amplifications from 800 individual eggs will be pooled in equimolar amounts. Each individual collection will be &lsquo;labeled' with a unique barcode primer, then all PCR products characterized via pyrosequencing. This pyrosequencing run serves as a positive control' that is, we expect to see the same number of individual taxa as in the 800 separately characterized sequences and in the same amounts, barring any inherent bias in the normalization of PCR products across 800 samples. Second, they will pool equimolar amounts of total genomic DNA isolated from each egg into their respective samples (20 eggs/sample), uniquely barcode each sample, amplify the 16s rRNA fragment using template from each sample (40 samples total), equalize the contribution of each amplified sample to the final template, and subject this final template to pyrosequencing. If no bias exists in terms of, for example, egg volume contribution to each sample, or implicit in the designed oligonucleotides, then we expect to see the same taxa in the same proportions as the 800 individually characterized eggs. Assuming no bias exists, then any future characterizations will use pooled eggs from each sample to isolate and amplify target DNA. Otherwise, if a bias does exist, then individual DNA isolation and amplification, irrespective of sample, would be most reliable, and yield quantitative information on species composition.
<p><br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source the Baruch Institute located at the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC. They are the only known company able to provide the service for the existing government requirement. The Baruch has prior experience in producing DNA barcoding databases for tunas, billfishes, snappers, groupers and sharks, and continuing work on larval identification. Their prior experience and technique barcoding will help form the basis of this proposed proof of concept. The researchers from the Baruch Institute have years of experience in the genetic analysis of fishes, and a history of experience in this form of using massively parallel DNA sequencing to characterize complex mixtures of fish eggs.</p>

<p>The purpose of the project is to narrowband the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) Comprehensive Communications Radio System (CRCS) in accordance with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandate.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">Information contained in this document</span></strong></p>
<p>This document is a request for Expression of Interest (EOI) and provides information for contractors interested in providing a solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">Requirements for Presentation</span></strong></p>
<p>WMATA is seeking contractors with interest and capacity to provide a proposed solution as outlined in the following Scope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested contractors <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> be invited to make a presentation of their proposed solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors will need to demonstrate an awareness and understanding of both FCC and WMATA requirements.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">Scope</span></strong></p>
<p>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) currently operates a Motorola ASTRO Smartzone 3.Z Digital Trunked Radio System using UHF frequencies. This advanced communications system is known as the Comprehensive Communications Radio System (CRCS) is used by multiple WMATA departments, including the Metropolitan Transit Police Department (MTPD), Rail, Bus, Paratransit and Maintenance departments.</p>
<p>WMATA is seeking qualified contractors that will narrowband the existing CRCS system in accordance with the FCC mandate for reducing channel bandwidth from 25 KHz to 12.5 KHz by the mandated date of January 1, 2013, or soon thereafter.</p>
<p>The CRCS consists of 10 radio transmitter sites strategically located to provide better than 95%/95% in street coverage using portable radios at hip level across the entire WMATA service area, about 1,600 square miles. The CRCS system is configured for [15] voice channels, [4] AVL data channel, [1] Data TAC/PMDC mobile data channel and [1] paging channel. All of these channels operate at 25KHz bandwidth. The CRCS operates as a redundantly controller, single cell wide-area similucast system. There are approximately 6,000 mobile and portable radios in use daily on the CRCS. Approximately a total of 74 dispatch consoles are currently in operation. Furthermore, one of the remote radio sites is used as a donor site feeding RF signals to a below ground distributed antenna system covering 105 miles of tunnel sections of the Metro Rail system.</p>
<p>The selected contractor shall engineer, procure, install, configure, integrate, test and commission the necessary hardware and software components required to convert the current CRCS to narrowband operation while maintaining same level of radio coverage, seamless operation and maximizing use of existing infrastructure and subscriber units.</p>
<p>While meeting these goals the migration to the end solution must be done in a manner compatible with WMATA's on-going operations and system consideration as follows:</p>

  Micropact Engineering, Inc., is considered the supplier who can supply an eVersity software subscription renewal and maintenance.  eVersity is a unique software that comes pre-loaded with the data tables and report format required by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions (EEOC) Management Directive (MD) 715.  eVersity automatically generates reports and workforce tables for data analysis purposes which is critical to DONs barrier identification and elimination efforts.  With eVersity, DON is able to compare workforce statistics with internal and external benchmarks, such as the 2000 Census data and other relevant civilian labor force.  In addition, when the 2010 Census data is released and when there are updates to EEOC MD 715 requirements, the changes can be implemented quickly with little ramp-up and minimized maintenance needs.
  Micropact Engineering Inc created the eVersity product and there is no other product in the current market that can provide the same service. The applicable North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 511210.

<DESC>SOLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION CONDUCTED UNDER THE TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS, FAR 13.5PR:	0040005576REF:	FAR 13.501(a)	DIAPR 2008-10 with Amendment 1	SM 404.31. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.  The Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey, Office of Acquisition and Grants, Sacramento Branch intends to contract on a sole-source basis.  This document sets forth the justification and approval as required by FAR 13.501(a).2. Nature/description of the action being approved.The contemplated action is a new contract to Telonics, Inc. of Mesa, AZ.  The contract will be issued on a firm-fixed price basis (per unit) for a quantity not exceeding 100 units to be delivered in two (2) batches, the first not later than 01 July 2011 and the second not later than 01 August 2011.  The exact quantity per batch will depend upon funding availability and successful arrangement of collaboration with Russian wildlife partners.3. Description of supplies/services required to meet the agencys needs, including estimated value.The USGS requires satellite telemetry transmitters with pressure transducer used for remote deployment (via crossbow or jab stick) on Pacific walruses fit with attachment anchors, which will be provided by the USGS.  The transmitters must be capable of:1)	Remote deployment on walruses without the use of immobilizing chemicals;2)	Enduring physical shocks of remote deployment and daily wear on free-ranging walruses inhabiting ice bearing waters and coastal haulouts;3)	Acquiring walrus haulout and foraging behavior records based on hourly on-board processing of conductivity and pressure transducer sensor data as specified by USGS (hauled out = 1 if more than 90% of conductivity readings indicate a dry state; and forage = 1 if more than 50% of pressure readings indicate a depth of 10m or deeper);4)	Producing transmissions that may be relayed through the Argos satellite data collection system that encode a message containing 119 hours of accumulated behavior data, a low voltage indicator, and a check sum;5)	Producing a minimum transmission power of 0.5 watts;6)	Achieving a mean minimal functional longevity of 7 weeks with a daily duty cycle of 12 hours on and a 60 second transmission interval; and7)	Being fit with a mechanism that allows activation of the transmitter under arctic field conditions.To enable remote deployment of transmitters units shall not exceed 140g mass and shall be configured to accept a deployment mechanism that may be propelled by a crossbow (or jab stick) and to be securely fit to a standard USGS sub-dermal anchor.  To ensure secure attachment to target walruses, the units must be securely fit with a standard USGS walrus anchor.  To ensure optimal battery reserves for each deployment, USGS requires that units be built in small batches in the months prior to planned deployment expeditions.  These requirements are all met by the Telonics LPT-145 tag, the replacement model to the previous LPT-125 model tag.If the USGS purchases the maximum quantity (100), the estimated value of this acquisition will be approximately redacted.Data on how the Pacific walrus is responding to changes in the arctic ecosystem is critically needed by the Department of the Interior (DOI).  The Pacific walrus is a high profile species managed by DOI, subject to a substantial and Alaska Native and Chukotka Native (in the Russian Far East) subsistence harvest, and currently under review for an Endangered Species Act listing.  Furthermore, DOI has leased sizable tracks of offshore lands for oil and gas development in a region that is used heavily by female and young walruses for foraging throughout the summer.  DOI urgently requires a refined understanding of walrus movement and foraging in these lease sale areas, and must develop an understanding of how Pacific walruses will respond to loss of sea ice over their summer foraging grounds.  Ice free conditions in recent years have resulted in unprecedented movements of walruses to U.S. Chukchi Sea coasts.  The altered movements and foraging patterns of these walruses and their unprecedented arrival in the tens of thousands on U.S. Chukchi Sea coasts have captured global media attention.  Solid data are urgently needed to place these new phenomena in a scientific context so that DOI may make sound management decisions. 4. Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.The proposed action may be awarded on a sole source basis under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  Telonics is the only source that can meet the USGS requirement as described in paragraph 3 above.The required items are determined to be commercial items as defined in FAR Part 2.  Satellite telemetry transmitters have many commercial uses and are routinely sold to the general public for purposes other than governmental purposes.  These particular items have been modified with regard to their attachment method, sensor package and on board processing algorithms to meet the USGS requirements, but this modification falls within the minor modifications language of the definition of commercial items.5. Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.The design of the LPT-145 rests on the development of the haulout monitoring data-logging satellite relayed tag that was developed for the 2006 Pacific walrus aerial survey.  This haulout monitoring tag was developed by soliciting and testing prototype tags developed by three vendors (redacted, Telonics, and redacted) beginning in 2002.  Based on data from 4 years of field trials, USGS selected the tag design that best met USGS scientific needs in 2006.  For a technical account of this process, see citation redacted.  At that time, the Telonics model of tag redacted tag was the basis of Telonics contribution to the study.When USGS began development of the requisitioned tag, in autumn 2006 USGS contacted the two (2) firms known to be capable of producing such a tag: Telonics and redacted.  Redacted declined to work with USGS on this project, even when approached in subsequent years (2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010).  Beginning in 2007 Telonics invested development costs to work with USGS researchers on this new tag.  USGS conducted laboratory and field trials of a prototype tag in 2007.  Based on positive results, USGS began deploying a commercial production model of the new tag (Telonics model redacted) in spring of 2008.USGS worked with Telonics in autumn of 2008 and spring of 2009 on a second round of product development focused on extending functional longevity and ensuring data integrity.  Product improvements included development of a superior energy delivery system and reduction of the tag size.  Deployments of the improved tag (Telonics model redacted) in 2010 demonstrated greater functional longevity and increased data integrity.Telonics has demonstrated a solid commitment to working with USGS to continually improve this telemetry system to meet the USGS science needs.  Each year subsequent to tag deployments, Telonics has worked closely with USGS to interpret data recovered from the tags for clues on how to further improve the tags.  During 2010 Telonics provided their chief engineer at no cost to USGS as a field assistant during a July 2010 tag deployment mission.  Working aboard a ship offshore in the arctic sea ice, USGS assembled a team of senior scientists for a hands-on workshop to further improve this telemetry system.  Participants in this workshop included the USGS chief scientists responsible for satellite-linked telemetry of wildlife, name redacted, and a senior scientist involved with analysis of telemetry data from marine mammals, name redacted from the institution redacted, as well as the chief engineer from Telonics, and USGS Alaska Science Center Walrus Research Program staff.It is critical that USGS maintain consistency in data results across studies over several years; and continuity in the incremental development of these tags, which have undergone software and housing configurations specifically for walrus telemetry.  USGS has deployed over 290 of these data logging satellite-linked telemetry tags capable of collecting walrus haulout and foraging behavior since the autumn of 2007.  A tag with similar performance and capable of producing data consistent with these previous deployments is not available from another vendor, and no other vendor has demonstrated the commitment to this effort that Telonics has. 6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.A notice of intent to award this action will be posted to the GPE as required by Subpart 5.2, inviting other interested offerors to submit their capabilities statements for review to determine whether competitive opportunities exist.  After award, the contracting officer will publicly post this justification, as required by FAR 13.501(a)(1)(iii).  7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.It is anticipated that both the per-unit and total prices will be fair and reasonable.  This anticipation is based on the USGS acquisition history with Telonics and the contracting officers knowledge of the broader market for satellite telemetry transmitters.  After a formal quotation is received, and prior to executing an award, the contracting officer will conduct a more detailed analysis and document the file accordingly.8. Description of the market research conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.In addition to the facts presented above, the contracting officer has conducted extensive market research in the wildlife telemetry tracking market.  There are a handful of well-qualified companies known to the contracting officer and his colleagues (names of nine (9) companies redacted.)  None have a product that is comparable to the Telonics product the USGS intends to acquire with this acquisition.9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.Previous recent purchase G10PX01022 for the same product was conducted by the previous contracting officer as a competitive acquisition utilizing a brand-name-or-equal specification referenced on the Telonics product.  Only one response was received, from Telonics.10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None.  Any responses to the notice of intent to award this proposed action and/or capabilities statements submitted will be documented in the contract file.  Updated information as of award  no responses to the notice of intent to award were received.11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.None at this time.  The USGS has made a strong effort to engage various potential sources during the developmental stages of this type of product, and continues to acquire this product in an open and transparent way.  The USGS cannot control that other manufacturers with the technical expertise to expand into this product offering make the business decision not to do so.  12. Certifications.12.1.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>

<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Original contract price" means the award price of the contract; or, for requirements contracts, the price payable for the estimated total quantity; or, for indefinite-quantity contracts, the price payable for the specified minimum quantity. Original contract price does not include the price of any options, except those options exercised at the time of contract award.<br /><br />(b) Amount of required bonds. Unless the resulting contract price is $150,000 or less, the successful offeror shall furnish performance and payment bonds to the Contracting Officer as follows: <br />(1) Performance bonds (Standard Form 25).

<p>I.7 652.225-71 SECTION 8(A) OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACTS OF 1979, AS AMENDED (AUG 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation. The Boycott of Israel by Arab League countries is such a boycott, and therefore, the following actions, if taken with intent to comply with, further, or support the Arab League Boycott of Israel, are prohibited activities under the Export Administration Act:</p>
<p>(1) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to do business with or in Israel, with any Israeli business concern, or with any national or resident of Israel, or with any other person, pursuant to an agreement of, or a request from or on behalf of a boycotting country;</p>
<p>(2) Refusing, or requiring any U.S. person to refuse to employ or otherwise discriminating against any person on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin of that person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such person;</p>
<p>(3) Furnishing information with respect to the race, religion, or national origin of any U.S. person or of any owner, officer, director, or employee of such U.S. person;</p>
<p>(4) Furnishing information about whether any person has, has had, or proposes to have any business relationship (including a relationship by way of sale, purchase, legal or commercial representation, shipping or other transport, insurance, investment, or supply) with or in the State of Israel, with any business concern organized under the laws of the State of Israel, with any Israeli national or resident, or with any person which is known or believed to be restricted from having any business relationship with or in Israel;</p>
<p>(5) Furnishing information about whether any person is a member of, has made contributions to, or is otherwise associated with or involved in the activities of any charitable or fraternal organization which supports the State of Israel; and,</p>
<p>(6) Paying, honoring, confirming, or otherwise implementing a letter of credit which contains any condition or requirement against doing business with the State of Israel.</p>
<p>(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ``compliance with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs <br />(a)(1)-(6) above:</p>
<p>(1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:</p>
<p>(i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,</p>
<p>(ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;</p>
<p>(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;</p>
<p>(3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;</p>
<p>(4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;</p>
<p>(5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,</p>
<p>(6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.</p>
<p>I.8 652.229-71 PERSONAL PROPERTY DISPOSITION AT POSTS ABROAD (AUG 1999)</p>
<p>Regulations at 22 CFR Part 136 require that U.S. Government employees and their families do not profit personally from sales or other transactions with persons who are not themselves entitled to exemption from import restrictions, duties, or taxes. Should the contractor experience importation or tax privileges in a foreign country because of its contractual relationship to the United States Government, the contractor shall observe the requirements of 22 CFR Part 136 and all policies, rules, and procedures issued by the chief of mission in that foreign country.</p>
<p>I.9 CONTRACTOR IDENTIFICATION (JULY 2008)</p>
<p>Contract performance may require contractor personnel to attend meetings with government personnel and the public, work within government offices, and/or utilize government email.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel must take the following actions to identify themselves as non-federal employees:</p>
<p>1) Use an email signature block that shows name, the office being supported and company affiliation (e.g. "John Smith, Office of Human Resources, ACME Corporation Support Contractor");</p>
<p>2) Clearly identify themselves and their contractor affiliation in meetings;</p>
<p>3) Identify their contractor affiliation in Departmental e-mail and phone listings whenever contractor personnel are included in those listings; and</p>

<p>K. 5 52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (MAY 2008)</p>
<p>(a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have __ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(C) Are ____ are not ____ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have ___, have not ____, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ____, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principals," for the purposes of this certification, means officers; directors; owners; partners; and, persons having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment, and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

The government will award a contract to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal, conforming to the RFP, will be most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical factors stated in this RFP.  Failure to propose a price for all CLINs will render the proposal unacceptable and the proposal will be rejected.<br><br>     2.  Evaluation factors upon which award will be based, are set forth below.<br><br>(b)  Evaluation Approach<br><br>     1.  The Government will evaluate each proposal by employing the lowest price technically acceptable method.  The written proposal, in conjunction with the on-site evaluation, will be used to assess evaluation factor ratings.<br><br>     2.  All proposals will be subjected to an initial screening by the Contracting Officer to determine whether proposals are complete before being evaluated as detailed below.  Proposals that are considered substantively incomplete after initial screening shall be rejected and offerors will be notified they are no longer eligible for further consideration.  Offerors are advised that unsupported promises to comply with contractual requirements will not be sufficient.  Additionally, a proposal that is unreasonable or incomplete in terms of price will not be considered for award.<br><br>     3.  The Government intends to award without discussions.  Offerors shall ensure their initial proposal contains its best terms from a technical and price standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to hold discussions if necessary.

Proposals submitted in response to the solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following factors:  Price, Past performance, and Mission Capability.  The Mission Capability and Past Performance factors are equal in importance and when combined are less important than the Price factor.  <br><br>1.  Mission Capability.  Under Mission Capability the following elements will be evaluated: Expert knowledge of JEFTS/ECS2 systems and the timeline for completion of tasks 1-7.  These elements will be evaluated together for acceptability in the Mission Capability area.  The Mission Capability factor will receive one of the following adjectival ratings:<br><br>	ACCEPTABLE  -  Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation (See Note below).<br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br><br>NOTE:  Expert knowledge of JFETS/ECS2 systems will be a key factor in the selection consideration process. A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.<br><br>	2.  Past Performance. Under Past Performance the following elements will be evaluated:  Experience working in JFETS/ECS2 environment.  The Past Performance Factor will receive one of the adjectival ratings:<br><br>ACCEPTABLE  -  Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (See Note below). <br><br>	UNACCEPTABLE  - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>NOTE:  No record of past performance will result in an acceptable rating.  Offerors shall submit only past performance relevant to the requirements set forth in this solicitation.  A proposal receiving an Unacceptable rating in this area will NOT be eligible for award.		<br><br>	3.  Price.  Price will be evaluated for reasonableness IAW FAR 15.403-1(c)(1).

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.
Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.
Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.
Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIA, OIEP Personnel Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.
If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 
If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.
Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

<DESC>TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE - FIRM FIXED PRICE
<p>Background:</p>
<p>AIDS.gov serves to support the policy and programs of HHS Federal programs and their grantee communities. AIDS.gov serves as an information gateway to drive Web traffic to Federal domestic HIV/AIDS information and resources along with the development of new media tools that improve the response to HIV/AIDS. In addition, we report on and monitor key Federal resources and policies that support the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. AIDS.gov and OHAP need a senior researcher who can provide support for HHS' Strategy implementation efforts.</p>
<p>The following pages include:</p>
<p>&bull; Introduction<br />&bull; Qualifications<br />&bull; Scope of Work-Tasks<br />&bull; Past Performance<br />&bull; Delivery Schedule<br /><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) is the first comprehensive, coordinated national HIV/AIDS plan. The Strategy identifies clear and measurable targets to be achieved by 2015, and requires multiple Federal Departments and agencies to compile detailed annual implementation plans and submit them to the White House and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>OHAP coordinates a variety of activities within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement the NHAS, and also collaborates with other Federal agencies to support the Strategy. The Secretary and the White House have tasked OHAP with a number of Strategy-related communications tasks which must be completed rapidly.</p>
<p>Many of the Federal implementation activities for the Strategy are predicated on all Americans having access to a common baseline of information about the current HIV epidemic. This includes: knowing how HIV is transmitted and prevented; knowing which behaviors place individuals at greatest risk for infection; and understanding the importance of early diagnosis and access to treatment. Equally important is sharing information about the Strategy and how various sectors of society are contributing to the national effort to achieve its goals. As such, the Department and White House are committed to continued transparency in implementing the Strategy and engaging stakeholders and the public in these efforts.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: The period of performance will include a base year (one year) and two one-year options. The deliverables will be the same for all years.</p>
<p>Base Year: July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012 tiny_mce_marker___________________<br />Option I: July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013 $&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;____________________<br />Option II: July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014 $&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;&not;____________________</p>
<p>QUALIFICATIONS<br />AIDS.gov and OHAP need a Senior HIV/Public Health Researcher who has:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge and experience of HIV/AIDS in the United States and its disproportionate impact on certain populations<br />2. Significant knowledge of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, including the Strategy, the accompanying Presidential Memorandum, the Federal Implementation Plan, lead agency operational plans, and the NHAS blog series<br />3. In-depth knowledge of the six lead Federal agencies (the Departments of Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, and the Social Security Administration) and their respective NHAS operational plans<br />4. Understanding of the roles, function, and members of the Department's NHAS Implementation Group and the HIV/AIDS activities of various HHS operational divisions and staff offices<br />5. Understanding of, and experience working with, the Office of HIV/AIDS Policy<br />6. Familiarity with purpose, audiences, and components of AIDS.gov and with HHS Web policies and procedures<br />7. Understanding of the Affordable Care Act and how it affects HIV prevention, care, and treatment<br />8. At least five (5) years of experience working on HIV/AIDS issues at a senior level<br />9. At least five (5) years of experience in public health communications activities across multiple Federal agencies dealing with diverse constituencies (e.g., public health leaders, national networks, local community-based organizations) and using a variety of communications channels, including fact sheets, blog posts, websites, and videos/podcasts.<br />10. Masters degree<br />11. Ability to attend at least 3 meetings per month in Washington, DC</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and<br />(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided<br />that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received. <br><br>1. SCOPE<br>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed. The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<br><br><br>2. REQUIREMENT<br>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide a lightweight, robotic improvised explosive device (IED) defeat system for both dismounted and mounted operations support. One possible solution would be a small robotic vehicle with an electrical generator and trailing arm used to disseminate electrical current into the ground at a high enough voltage so as to disrupt or pre-detonate command wire IEDs. Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <br><br><br>3. INSTRUCTIONS TO POTENTIAL RESPONDENTS/DELIVERABLES<br>The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. <br><br>Please submit specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph two (2) above, or otherwise solves the problem identified above. <br><br>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a response which supports the company's claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above. The response should discuss the company's ability to develop and or provide existing technologies that have the abilities described above. Companies should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed. Respondents shall also discuss whether their product is considered commercial in accordance with "commercial item" definition found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 2.101.<br><br>The response should discuss related company experience, business size and include point(s) of contact. The response should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to BOTH the Contract Specialist at Thomas.Marousek@us.army.mil and the Contracting Officer at Kandi.McDonald@us.army.mil. <br><br>The government will review submissions as they are received. <br><br>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN TUESDAY 19 APRIL 2011 AT 10:00 AM EST. However, the government reserves the right to close this Sources Sought Notice once they have received adequate response(s).<br><br>All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. For questions, potential respondents shall email BOTH the Contract Specialist at Thomas.Marousek@us.army.mil and the Contracting Officer at Kandi.McDonald@us.army.mil to obtain information.

<DESC><p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307</p>

<DESC><strong>Note: FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT.</strong>
<p><strong>The solicitation for this project will be posted on or about April 28, 2011.<br /><br /></strong>This project will provide hot mix asphalt concrete pavement (HMAC) to patches of road which were washed out with the 2010 Flood Event on National Forest System Road 39 (Hells Canyon Scenic Byway). These sections of road were repaired via a Federal Highway Administration contract in the fall of 2010, but were left in an aggregate surface condition. Project activities are located in thirteen sections of road and will include removal and disposal of approximately 3" of the top crushed aggregate surfacing (retaining enough material to replace the shoulder rock), and replacing this material with 3" of HMAC. All associated work such as preparatory work, placement of tack coat, haul, processing, compacting of HMAC and shoulder rock, and any brooming or cleanup work is considered indirect to the placement of the HMAC. Contractor shall be required to provide temporary traffic control during his construction operations.</p>
<p>The project is located approximately 20 miles east of Halfway, OR on NFSR 39 (Hells Canyon Scenic Byway and All-American road). The project begins just south of the junction of Lake Fork Campground road (MP 40.78) and ends at MP 47.25, approximately 1.4 miles north of the junction with Oregon State Highway 86.</p>
<p>This project is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>

<DESC>AMENDMENT #2

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS


1.	I am interested in Construction Management agent (CMa) opportunities.  Will the VA be looking for CMa on this project?  If so, please advise when the RFQ might come out.

The decision to solicit for Construction Management services has not been determined at this time.

2.	Can you please share with me how I can be made aware of the winning bidder?  

Contract award will be announced in the FedBizOpps website at www.fbo.gov. 

3.	The solicitation calls for resumes of Key Personnel.  It also mentions Additional Personnel.  Are resumes required, suggested or not required for the additional Personnel (Historic Preservation Specialist, Blast Consultant, Commissioning, etc.)?

This is a business decision of the firm.

4.	The solicitation limits the size of the submittal to 100 pages with specific criteria related to formatting, text and how many pages are counted.  How will the evaluation of the submission be impacted by including over 100 pages?

Only the first hundred pages of the submission will be reviewed if package exceeds one hundred pages.

5.	I need to come by the site tomorrow morning and take some pictures.  I was wondering what the procedure is for issuing a permit for that purpose?

A site visit is not scheduled before the submittal date.

6.	What is the anticipated range for the construction value of the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center Project No. 691-408, Build New Essential Care Tower, Correct Seismic Deficiencies and Renovate Bldg. 500, Solicitation Number: VA10111RP0101?

The estimated price range for construction project is more than $100,000,000.

7.	Regarding the statement "The prime contractor should have, at least, the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines as members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architects, Medical Planners, Structural Engineers, Seismic Design Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Geo-technical Engineers, Historic Preservation Architects, Environmental Engineers, Communications and Electrical Engineers, Interior Designers, Sustainable Design and LEED Accredited Professionals, and Cost Estimators", does everyone on the team have to be licensed in CA or can they be licensed anywhere, with preference in CA?  

Applicants must have an established working office within one hundred (100) mile radius of the project site, West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, 11301 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90073; be of sufficient size and experience to accomplish the work; and be licensed and insured to work in the State of California.  Preference will be given to firms with working offices capable of performing all design work within one hundred (100) miles of the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center.

The requirement for Registration of Designers is specified in FAR Clause 52.236-25.

52.236-25 Requirements for Registration of Designers (June 2003)

Architects or engineers registered to practice in the particular 
professional field involved in a State, the District of Columbia, or an 
outlying area of the United States shall prepare or review and approve the 
design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or 
other engineering features of the work.

(End of clause)

8.	I notice that you are requesting both a searchable pdf and word file electronically.  Are we required to submit a word version of our submittal or is pdf sufficient?

Please submit six (6) hard copies and two (2) electronic copies (one in Microsoft Word and one in a searchable pdf) on CD or DVD.

<DESC>DUNS 196202402Contract DE-LM0000356 in the amount of $154,044.14 was awarded to Recall Total Information Management (Recall) for immediate support to permanently withdraw and ship all record holdings from the Recall Total Information Management (Recall) records storage facility in Las Vegas, NV to the LM Business Center in Morgantown, WV and to the Hillshire office complex in Las Vegas, NV.
Recall will permanently withdraw, palletize, stretch wrap, transport, and ship the records stored at the Recall facility. The scope of this effort is due to the transfer of long-term surveillance responsibilities of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Repository Project from the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (RW) to LM.
Recall is uniquely qualified to support LM in providing these services due to its access to records at its facility and its ability to immediately prepare the records for permanent withdrawal to DOE sites. The final withdrawal of the records was intended to be accomplished through the previous award; however, due to the cancellation of the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Repository Project, the records management withdrawal was not completed. No other company has immediate access to the government records and is prepared to immediately transport these files to DOE sites. Due to the fact that the records are currently stored at the Recall facility and the withdrawal of the records is the final transaction for this project, Recall was awarded a contract to provide these services.
In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 USC 253 [c] [1], as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC><br />Pursuant to FAR 6.301-1, LCE is the only contractor that can satisfy the requirement, because its employee, Mr. John Mazurana, is the only individual that can satisfy the necessary requirements of this procurement. The task requires specific knowledge of the requirements for the new T-AOE 6 Class MCS. Mr. Mazurana is extremely knowledgeable about the requirements of the new MCS replacement's technical specification and how it relates to the ship class. A Justification and Approval more thoroughly explaining MSC's decision to issue this requirement on an other than full and open competition basis was synopsized on Federal Business Opportunities on 01 April 2011.
<p>A firm-fixed-price contract strategy was researched and discussed, however, it was determined that a fixed price contract would not be an optimum contractual strategy for this procurement. The level of effort for this requirement is contingent upon the progress made under the MCS contract and is thus unknown. For instance, the Contractor may be tasked to review Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs) required under the MCS Project. The data involved is not always complete and often requires further revisions that may, through no fault of its own, delay the Contractor. This creates uncertainty in projecting hours, with sufficient accuracy, needed by the Contractor to finish the task when issuing an order.</p>
<p>When the level of effort is unknown, using a fixed-price contract will result in higher costs due to the large administrative burden. Because of the high level of unknowns and the high administrative costs of managing a firm fixed price contract with an unknown level of effort it is recommended to utilize a cost plus fixed fee type contract.</p>
<p>Orders issued under this contract will be cost reimbursable labor and will be paid at cost and the Contractor will be provided a fixed fee per hour. Orders may be term or completion type. Completion type orders will be used to the maximum extent possible as they provide incentive for the efficient and effective completion of the requirements of the order within the required period of performance. While the labor rates will have been found reasonable prior to award of the Contract, a cost realism analysis shall be conducted prior to the issuance of each order to ensure that the price is realistic and LCE has considered all elements of the order requirements in their approach. Each order shall include a funded ceiling price that the Contractor exceeds at its own risk.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Postgraduate Schools .EDU network requires an external provider of CND service as directed by Navy NETWARCOM to monitor network traffic at the .EDU network boundary for suspicious or anomalous behavior.  The addition of an external CND will provide a secondary perspective to analysis of threats detected by Intrusion Detection Systems at NPS and will add functionality to the CND service that is already in place.  One requirement of this project is that the CND service provider be able to interface with Information Assurance staff and, if necessary, system administrators to assess potential threats detected by internal and external IDS systems.
