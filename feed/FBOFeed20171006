<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>SYNOPSIS: MEDTRONIC VERTEX KIT<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />This synopsis is issued in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1) and FAR 5.207. This proposed action is for the procurement of Medtronic Vertex Kit. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a sole source award under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113: Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard for NAICS 339113 is 750 employees. PSC code: 6515 - Medical and Surgical Instruments, Equipment and Supplies. <br />Delivery Schedule: 25 October 2017</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Destination:</strong> Medical Materiel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bldg 830 Area A <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4881 Sugar Maple Dr.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433<br /><br /><strong>Requirement:</strong> The Government requires the Medtronic Vertex Kit for multi-level spinal surgeries that will take place Medical Treatment Facility at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base. The spinal surgeries are necessary for patients that have completed spinal, transiliac and/or trans-sacral fractured-dislocation of the spine with an <br />insignificant, small fragment. This could lead to patients becoming infected and being brought in for surgery to check damaged bone(s).</p>
<p><strong>The items required in the Medtronic Vertex Kit is on an attachment.</strong></p>
<p>The proposed source is Medtronic, Inc. 710 Medtronic Pkwy, Minneapolis, MN 55432-5603</p>
<p>This procurement will not be competed because the aforementioned Medtronic Vertex Kit is the only known systems that the ortho-spine surgeon is trained on for multi-level spinal surgeries. This system will aide in the ability to complete more complicated surgeries in a timely manner. If these are items in the Medtronic Vertex Kit are not used, then the surgeries in the future would need to be sent off base at a substantial duplication cost of approximately $89,000.</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Technical Capability and Price will be used to evaluate all offers.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single point of DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the government. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012.

Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<CONTACT>Shameeka Edwards, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-382-7331, Email sedwards@bbg.gov
<DESC><div style="text-align: center;"><strong>***This is not a solicitation and offers are not being requested at this time***</strong></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Notice of "Open Season"<br />Broadcasting Board of Governors - Office of Internet Freedom Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools Blanket Ordering Agreement</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The purpose of this notice is to advise the public that the Broadcasting Board of Governors' (BBG) Office of Internet Freedom (OIF) intends to hold an "Open Season" period under which proposals will be solicited with the intent of adding new vendors to the agency's multiple-award/multiple task-area Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) number BBG50-G-15-0006.<br />This notice is the pre-solicitation notice for the OIF's forthcoming open season Request for Proposals (RFP) for its Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools BOA. Under the forthcoming solicitation, the agency will hold a new competitive procurement to select additional awardees who may compete for orders under task areas 1, 2, 4, and 5. The agency has no plans to award work under task area 3 at this time. The competition will be open to all responsible business concerns having the requisite technical capabilities necessary to provide Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools.<br />The agency is holding the Open Season period with the intent of improving competition, which will result in access to innovative and improved technologies and capabilities, enhanced metrics, improved performance and competitive pricing.<br /><br /><strong>General BOA Information</strong><br /><br />The Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools Blanket Ordering Agreement was awarded as a multiple-award/multiple task-area agreement, which is currently in its second year of a five year ordering period. The BOA promotes the use of performance-based contracting and accommodates task orders issued with the following terms: fixed-price (FP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M).<br />The agency intends to hold competitive procurements for the issuance of new task orders shortly after concluding Open Season awardee selections. The agency anticipates that new task order solicitations will be issued during mid to end of fall, 2017. However, the exact date for issuance of new task order solicitations is not guaranteed and may occur later in the year.<br /><strong><br />Synopsis of Overall Scope of BOA</strong><br /><br />The overall purpose of the BOA and the general nature of the work for task orders awarded under the BOA is to obtain Internet censorship circumvention tools and services. The primary supplies and services required under this contract relate to state-of-the art, specialized information technology (IT) software and systems for circumventing Internet censorship by foreign governments, and require active, ongoing maintenance and support throughout the term of the Task Orders by the Contractor to ensure required service levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Synopsis of Task Areas 1, 2, 4 and 5<br /></strong><br />The type of work projects planned for task areas 1, 2, 4 and 5 is synopsized below.<br /><strong><br />Task Area 1 - Circumvention Client Software<br /></strong><br />The contractor shall provide a system to circumvent Internet censorship imposed by foreign governments and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using client software technology, which, at a minimum, transparently proxies HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic, and may, based on individual Task Order requirements, implement transparent proxy services for additional protocol traffic, up to and including full Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.  This system will work on operating systems as specified in each individual Task Order, which may include various desktop and mobile computing devices. This system must allow Internet users in target countries to use this client software package to circumvent the censorship of the Internet within their country.<br /><strong><br />Task Area 2 - Clientless Web Proxies<br /></strong><br />The Contractor shall provide a network of web proxies which may be accessed by any web browser which supports Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) and which can be distributed by BBG broadcasters.  This system must allow Internet users in target countries to circumvent the censorship of the Internet within their country by accessing web proxies operated by the Contractor which are distributed globally and use a diverse set of domain names and dynamic IP addresses which cannot easily be discovered, enumerated, and blocked. The proxy sites will need to be changed regularly, based on the specifics of site blockages in the target countries.<br /><br /><strong>Task Area 4 - Electronic Mail Newsletter Distribution</strong><br /><br />The Contractor shall distribute an electronic mail (email) newsletter provided by BBG broadcasters to a list of electronic mail addresses provided by the broadcasters, and validated by the Contractor, on a schedule as specified in the Task Order.  The Contractor shall evade attempts by foreign governments to censor these newsletters by a variety of techniques.<br /><strong><br />Task Area 5 - Censorship Circumvention Technical Expertise and Support<br /></strong><br />The Contractor shall provide technical expertise in Internet censorship circumvention to further the BBG's other Internet anti-censorship initiatives.  This may consist of producing technical documentation and reports on the current state of Internet censorship in target countries; providing computer programming and software engineering for BBG's internal software products, open source software, or other Contractor's software; or setup, maintenance, and operation of computer systems and network devices.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />NNK13ZLS004Q-Revision-D<br />Notice Type: <br />Synopsis
<p>CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services 2017 On-Ramp</p>
<p>The CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services Request for Proposal (RFP) was issued on December 5, 2013, and remains open for a period of five years from the effective date through the use of an innovative on-ramp provision found in Section I, Clause I.6. To date, the RFP has resulted in the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to 406 Aerospace LLC, A-Tech Corporation, Spaceflight, Inc., TriSept Corporation, and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. Each October during the life of the contract, or at any other time established via synopsis, the Government will request proposals from new CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Service providers for IDIQ contracts and proposals from existing IDIQ contractors for additional CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services.</p>
<p>A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized space research satellite that typically uses commercial, off-the-shelf electronic components. In support of this effort, offerors must be capable of performing the standard service, which includes engineering development support, dispenser carrier hardware, CubeSat to dispenser and dispenser to launch vehicle (LV) integration, and system testing. Additionally, offerors may be required to perform non-standard services (such as de-integration and commercial flight services), mission unique services, and special task assignments related to the hardware and integration services. In support of upcoming missions, it is the Government's intent to solicit potential offerors for 12U dispenser hardware in addition to 3U and 6U dispenser hardware previously identified in the CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services RFP. Offerors need not be capable of performing commercial flight services to be eligible for an IDIQ contract award under this acquisition.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period is effective from date of contract award through July 7, 2019. The minimum order value is $10,000 with a maximum order value of $9,500,000.</p>
<p>This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p>Based on NASA's knowledge of the current CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services marketplace, it is not anticipated that any new or existing offerors will have new hardware or service capabilities to on-ramp during the 2017 on-ramp period. Based on this, NASA does not anticipate releasing a solicitation revision to request proposals for a 2017 on-ramp. However, should a new or existing offeror have CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services that they intend to on-ramp in 2017, the offeror should be aware that the ordering period is through July 7, 2019. <br /><br />It is requested that all interested parties notify NASA, in writing, no later than October 20, 2017, of your intent to submit a proposal during this on-ramp period, as well as the CubeSat dispensers you intend to propose. If no viable responses are received, NASA will not conduct a 2017 CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services on-ramp.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Should NASA decide to release an RFP revision for the 2017 on-ramp it is anticipated that proposals will be due on or around December 1, 2017</span>. The firm date for the receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation, which will be considered by NASA.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet on the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). The GPE can be accessed via the Internet at http://fedbizopps.gov. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".</p>
<p>Additionally, NASA will not release an on-ramp in 2018 as a result of the contract ending in July 2019.</p>

<DESC>Request for Proposals #140P8318R0001 is to replace windows, skylights, and exterior doors at the North Cascades Visitor Center.  This building was built in 1991 and is 11,930 square feet.  The glass elements to be replaced are original.  The building will be closed to the public during construction although NPS employees may work on-site intermittently.  Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals, which will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately October 23, 2017.   
PROJECT LOCATION: The North Cascades Visitor Center is located in Newhalem, WA, approximately 65 miles east of Sedro-Woolley WA within Ross Lake National Recreation Area.  Maps and information are posted at www.nps.gov/NOCA.       
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held in early November 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation.  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory).  Requests for individual hosted site visits will not be honored; however, contractors may view the buildings exterior and site individually any time.  The visitor center is open to the public October 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 28, 2017, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, and then closes until early May, 2018.  
TARGET WORK DATES:  The period of performance will be 60 days after commencing on-site work and substantial completion must occur by May 4, 2018.  The Notice to Proceed will likely be issued in January and the Contractor may select their on-site starting date.  We anticipate that the work will occur in March and April, 2018, due to winter weather conditions at the site.  
DETAILS:  This is a best value negotiated procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5. The NAICS code for this project is 238150, Glass and Glazing Contractors, and the small business size standard is $15 million, average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  All work will be performed under a single firm-fixed-price construction contract subject to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction), formerly known as the Davis-Bacon Act.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $150,000 and $250,000.  
The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF. Offerors will submit their proposals in digital format per instructions included in the solicitation.  The RFP will require offerors to submit both a technical and a price proposal; the government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price and award to the firm whose offer represents the best value.  All eligible responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the National Park Service, however offerors who have not established and/or maintained an active registration at www.SAM.gov prior to the offer due date and time will be considered either ineligible or non-responsive and will not be considered for award.  A bid (offer) guarantee (20%), payment bond (100%), performance bond (100%), and liability insurance will be required prior to contract performance.
Vendors can search for opportunities and award history on www.fbo.gov without registering. The Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) website has an Interested Vendors List where you can add your company's interest. Registering provides the opportunity to receive notifications; this is a tool of convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification.  Prospective offerors will be required to visit www.FBO.gov periodically to check for amendments and other changes to the contract documents; no other notifications will be sent.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued.   
It is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors, (large or small) are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors on SUB-Net accessed at http://web.sba.gov/subnet/, and to utilize the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Dynamic Small Business Search for potential subcontractors within these various socio-economic categories.

The availability includes a combination of maintenance, modernization, and repair, and requires a highly capable contractor with substantial facilities, to include a CG 47 class capable pier and dry-dock as well as human resources capable of completing, coordinating, and integrating multiple areas of ship maintenance, repair, and modernization. The delivery date of the USS COWPENS is expected to be no later than 30 October 2019. The delivery date of the USS GETTYSBURG is expected to be no later than 27 October 2019.</p>
<p>These availabilities are competed on a nation-wide basis. Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicates there are not two or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement and therefore this procurement will not be set-aside for small business (FAR 19.502-2(b)).</p>
<p>The work packages for the MODPRDs will be made available to interested parties. In addition, the USS COWPENS and USS GETTYSBURG will be available to potential Offerors and Subcontractors for ship checks and reviews.

As this is a Total Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside, Vendors shall also be registered and active at VA Vendor Information Pages at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/ at time of offer.

The VA follows requirements specified by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Vendors shall have proper Wholesale Drug Distributor state-issued license at time of offer. 

Please refer to Section E of Solicitation for Quote Submittal Instructions and Evaluation Factors.

(m) Instructions for Quote Submittal 

Technical questions shall be addressed via e-mail only to Doug Reed, Contracting Specialist, at mark.lojewski@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified in Block 8 of SF 1449.

Pricing, Copy of State-Issued Wholesale Drug Distributor License, and Signed Standard Form (SF 1449) of Solicitation shall be e-mailed to Mark Lojewski, Contracting Specialist, at mark.lojewski@va.gov by Offer Due Date/Time specified on Block 8 of SF 1449: 

Vendors shall submit pricing on Solicitation Attachment 1 (Quote Spreadsheet) 

Pricing submitted shall be on Microsoft Excel format of Quote Spreadsheet. Alternate formats, including PDF format, will not be accepted. Vendors proposing alternate National Drug Codes (NDC) for items and/or alternate delivery dates for items shall list these on the Quote Spreadsheet.

Vendors shall submit copy of State-Issued  Wholesale Drug Distributor License

VA follows U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) regulations to ensure reputable, properly licensed wholesale drug distributors.

For DSCSA purposes, generally any entity that engages in the distribution of a drug to a person other than a consumer or patient or receipt of a drug by a person other than the consumer or patient  is considered a wholesale distributor. See section 581(29) & 503(e)(4)) of the DSCSA. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and should be licensed as a wholesale distributor. If the entity is actually buying and selling the drugs, they are conducting activities that constitute wholesale distribution and shall be licensed as a wholesale distributor. 

Third party logistics providers (3PL) are not eligible to submit a quote. A 3PL is defined in the DSCSA as an entity which  provides or coordinates warehousing, or other logistics services of a product in interstate commerce on behalf of a manufacturer, wholesale distributor, or dispenser of a product, but does not take ownership of the product nor have responsibility to direct the sale.  Because the Government is seeking firms to procure drugs for the VA, by definition, 3PLs do not take ownership nor have the responsibility to direct the sale of the drugs. Therefore, 3PLs are not eligible. 

This is also applicable in regards to vendors citing  drop shipment  provisions of the DSCSA as the reason for licensure not required. Section 582(f) of the FD&C Act exempts wholesale distributors who,  do not physically handle or store product,  from certain provisions of section 582 involving product tracing and product identifiers. While the  drop shipment  description may apply to the awardee(s), it does not exempt them from the requirement that they be licensed as wholesale distributors. 

3) Vendors shall sign and submit SF 1449 of solicitation. By signing, vendor acknowledges all solicitation amendments (if applicable) and certifies IAW FAR 52.209-5 (Representation by Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Tax Liability or Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law) that Vendor: 

Does not have any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability. 
Vendor, including its officers or agents acting on its behalf, have not been convicted of a felony criminal violation under a Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months

<DESC>NOTE:&nbsp;This replaces the previoulsy posted Sources Sought Notice W52P1J-16-S-SCDI from July 2016.&nbsp; Any responses to that notice shall be resubmiited (to include any revisions) in response to this revised notice.&nbsp;<br /><br />Description: The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager for Maneuver Ammunition Systems, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is currently seeking sources for the production of the following items: 5.56mm Single Round, Dummy Drilled Inert (DDI), M199A2 (DODIC AB46); 7.62mm Single Round, DDI, M63A2 (DODIC AB47); Cal .50 Linked, DDI, M2A2 (DODIC AB36); and Cal .50 Single Round, DDI, M2A2 (DODIC AB48).
<p>This family of DDI cartridges are employed for Soldier training and in some instances as a field weapon gage. The cartridges provide the Soldier with a safe and effective training experience during basic Warrior Skills training such as chambering and clearing weapons and ammunition familiarity and can be re-used a minimum of twenty five (25) iterations. In some instances, the cartridges are used to perform verification of proper weapon setup after maintenance procedures due to their Profile &amp; Alignment (P&amp;A).</p>
<p>These cartridges shall be compatible with existing associated calibered weapons and lubricants, to include being used in standard linked or single round configurations.</p>
<p>These cartridges are silver in color so they can be distinguished from live ammunition, so that even the most untrained Soldier can immediately distinguish if a live round is introduced. The cartridge cases have six (6) corrugations described as flutes to support tactile identification (limited visibility scenarios). The DDI is inert and incapable of firing. No primer, vent hole, propellant or weight fill is employed within these DDI cartridges.</p>
<p>5.56mm Single Round, Dummy Drilled Inert (DDI), M199A2 (DODIC AB46), and 7.62mm Singe Round, DDI, M63A2 (DODIC AB47) are packaged in single round/carton configurations. They also need to sustain Soldier relinking in the field. The Cal .50 Linked, DDI, M2A2 (DODIC AB36), is already packaged connected with associated M9, .50 Caliber Link whereas the Cal .50 Single Round, DDI, M2A2 (DODIC AB48), is provided in carton configuration. Either configuration may be linked or re-linked in the field by Soldiers.</p>
<p>Sources must have design, manufacturing, engineering and quality acceptance expertise sufficient to meet the specification and drawing requirements for these cartridges. The US Government overall performance objectives will be communicated in the Performance Specifications. The necessary manufacturing processes and forming techniques to achieve these goals will be the responsibility of the offeror, therefore sufficient engineering capability needs to be available. The cartridge may be assembled from case and bullet or manufactured as one unit. If assembled, the crimp joining the bullet to case shall be designed to meet Bullet Extraction requirements. If cartridge is plated to meet the color requirement, the offeror will need to account for plating thickness as well as preclude plating chemicals from entering and remaining in the cartridge. Cartridge must meet Profile &amp; Alignment (P&amp;A) dimensions to function as intended.</p>
<p>The US Government owns a Fluted Dummy Cartridge Case Machine designed to apply (6) flutes to a cartridge for the purpose of manufacturing DDI. Dies are interchangeable for each specific cartridge 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and Cal .50. The use of this machine is not required. More information is available upon request.</p>

<p>NOTE: All listed documents are Distribution "D" unless otherwise indicated. Army Nomenclature System: The appearance of type designators (ex: M199A2) in specifications and drawings does not in itself constitute an official type-designation assignment. The type designator consists of prefix letter "M-", a number, and suffix alpha-numeric combination which indicates a modification. The suffix -"A2" was unofficially and temporarily chosen for the new DDI design to distinguish it from the current DDI design -"A1". The new DDI is to be produced under a performance specification but is intended to be nearly identical in form, fit, and function. A final decision on suffix is dependent on how similar the new design is to the current design.</p>

It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) nor a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. The information provided in response to this PSS is for discussion purposes only and any potential strategy that may be developed from these discussions would be subject of a separate, future announcement.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">The information received in response to this PSS may be utilized by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in developing an acquisition strategy, and requirements documents (i.e. Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement, or Purchase Description).

<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">DESCRIPTION: DLA Troop Support - Medical in Philadelphia anticipates possible award(s) to upgrade software and hardware for two Defense Health Agency (DHA) military treatment facilities (MTF). These bases are at Fort Belvoir Community Hospital (FBCH) and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC). The award(s) will procure software and hardware to integrate with radiation dose monitoring software. This integration needs to support push web services for plain text in Radimetrics. Push web services allows for radiation dosage information to be pushed from PowerScribe 360 directly into Radimetrics, which is what DHS needs to support Radimetrics workflow across their systems. This also reduce the number of steps to acquire data as well as the number of physical network interfaces <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">are limited. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>PowerScribe 360 is installed in the Government Approved Lab (GAL) and tested with MHS Genesis (Cerner). It is the only voice recognition system included in the platform, which means that if PowerScribe 360 is not procured, DHS will not be able to leverage voice recognition in the new Electronic Health Record (HER).</span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">In addition to software and hardware upgrades, the award(s) will procure training for end user radiologists. With this upgrade, DHS is also seeking to purchase associated hardware to include microphones that will maximize the use of the software upgrade. The Government plans to procure these items as commercial items through fixed priced award(s).</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">There is currently one known source (brand): <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Two companies can provide PowerScribe 360. Nuance Communications, Inc., Burlington, MA 01803 - the manufacturer; and,</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">Carahsoft Technology Corporation, Reston, VA 20190 - an authorized distributor of PowerScribe 360.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">Essential Characteristics:</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">- Solution must have a working interface with Radiation Dose Monitoring software (Radimetrics) push web services for plain text.</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Solution must be software installed in the Government Approved Lab (GAL) and tested with MHS Genesis (Cerner)</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Vendor provided volume based licensing structure that can accommodate changes in provider numbers without having to purchase additional licenses</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Vendor provided hardware configurations that function on approved operating systems (Windows Server 2008 R2, or later)</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software application is installed through web based client and does not use a specific version of Java Script</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software functions on diagnostic radiology workstations without any substantial system modification or configuration changes (can be easily installed by radiology personnel)</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Voice dictation speech engine can handle medical terminology</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software platform can be integrated into multiple Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) platforms (i.e. Agfa, Fuji, Carestream, McKesson)</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software can ingest data from radiation dose monitoring applications and transmit information into a standard report</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-System must make use of speech engine with the same functional characteristics as Dragon Medical Speech engine v. 12.0 or higher</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Hardware configurations can be performed by the vendor prior to shipment/installation</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software application features an integrated assisted diagnostic function that enables providers to search for specific medical information from within the application to improve disease diagnostics</p>
<p style="tab-stops: 108.6pt">-Software integrates critical test results management directly into the reporting process to ensure MTFs meet mandatory regulatory notification guidelines</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in; tab-stops: -.75in -.5in .25in .5in 1.0in 1.5in 1.75in 2.5in;">The work consist of design and construction administration (CA) services for the multi-phase construction of four new buildings with historic preserviation requirements, as stipulated by execution of recent Memorandum of Agreemtn between the U.S. Department of Labor, The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), and the City of Gulfport. &nbsp;There are substantial public interface, presentation, and outreach requirements for the project for which the Architect/Engineer team will be primarily responsible. &nbsp;Two of the four buildings will need to be integrated into the design of the two new buildinggs. &nbsp;The facades to be retained will be required to be temporarily supported once the remainder of the buildings of which they are currently part are demolished. &nbsp;Due to the size of the new building footprints required to satisfy building program requirements, it is anticipated that geotechnical testing and a full replacement of existing on-site utilities and surface features will be required. &nbsp;The design will also need to be phased for construction into a least two distinct phases due to the need to keep the existing operating Job Corps Center functioning. &nbsp;Design services may include site adaptation, code compliance update, and minor revisions for historic preservation architectural features for the prior designs of two of the four buildings for which facade retention is not an issue, and entirely new designs for the two buildings which will be interated with the facades to be retained. &nbsp;All four buildings will be located&nbsp;on approximately five acres. &nbsp;Federal mandates affecting energy usage and storm water management will also be applied to the project, among others. &nbsp;The site is a leased site, and performance of a design which results in a local building permit will be required, as coordinated through the City&rsquo;s Building Department during the course of design. &nbsp;Also included in the design services is the testing required to evaluate the condition and design proper bracing of the existing facades, as well as inclusion of hazardous and other material abatement in the project specifications. &nbsp;Estimate Value of the construction to be designed is over $10,000,000.</p>

The site must be repairable within a four month period and cannot be located in a Floodway, Coastal High Hazard Area or Coastal Barrier Resource Unit or Otherwise Protected Properties. Within this program, there is no rental cost for the eligible applicant.

Number of parking spaces (including accessible and van-accessible) available for each unit.</p>
<p><strong>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ITS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES.<br /></strong>Responses to this notification will be used to determine which properties meet MLR criteria and provide the timeliest, most cost-effective means of providing direct assistance to eligible disaster survivors. The Government wants to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes.</p>

The Department of Veteran s Affairs Seeks to lease the following:

State:  Michigan
City:  Detroit 
Delineated Area:  North: Seven Mile Road, South: Eight Mile Road, East: Van Dyke Road West: Gratiot Ave
Minimum Rentable Square Foot:  24,116.24 
Maximum Rentable Square Foot:  32,557.14 
Space Type:  Office
Parking Spaces (Total):  100
Parking Spaces (Reserved):  15
Full Term:  4 Years
Firm Term:  2 Years
Option Term:  2 Years

Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic and sustainability standards per the terms of the lease.  A fully service lease is required and the offered space shall not be in the 100-year flood plain.

The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Detroit, MI that will be expiring.  The space is being used as a Domiciliary. The Government will consider alternative space if it is economically advantageous.  In making a determination the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that can potentially satisfy the above requirement as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, i.e. physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements, information technology and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.    

Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) who have properties meeting the above criteria should submit the information listed below via email to Lee Morris, Lease Contract Specialist at lee.morris@va.gov, no later than Midnight EST, 12 OCT 2017. 

Information on properties submitted must include a property description, the address and the total number of parking spaces available.  The VA will coordinate a market survey of properties offered for lease at a later date.


Please note that this advertisement is not a solicitation for offers, nor is it a request for proposals.  A solicitation for offers may be issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs at a later date.

STATEMENT OF WORK 
Abiomed-Impella 
Introduction/Background
This transaction is for the setup of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with the vendor Abiomed for the ongoing purchase of Impella Catheters for one base year and 3 option years. This contract will provide more timely accessibility of supplies and materials needed for High Risk/Life-Threatening diagnostic and interventional cardiac procedures. It will reduce procurement lead times and simplify the ordering process. Impella Catheters have been used in the lab for approximately 3 years. This product has been previously ordered as an EMERGENCY and the estimated quarterly par levels are used to determine the amount ordered as an EMERGENCY. 
The Impella Catheter replaces the Tandem Heart machine and is used in the Cath Lab during emergency catheterization surgeries. It is the world s smallest heart pump that provides cardiac support by pumping blood through the heart during a procedure.  In high risk patients for whom surgery is not an option, interventional cardiac procedures utilize this ventricular assist device to assist the heart.  This device can successfully save lives during high risk procedures when other options are no longer available. Below is an overview of each type of Impella catheter. 
The Impella CP Circulatory Support System is intended for partial circulatory support using an extracorporeal bypass control unit, for periods up to 6 hours. It is also intended to be used to provide partial circulatory support (for periods up to 6 hours) during procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. The Impella CP Circulatory Support System also provides pressure measurements which are useful in determining intravascular pressure.
The Impella 2.5 System (Impella 2.5) is a temporary (< 6 hours) ventricular assist device indicated for use during high risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in elective or urgent, hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined that high risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability which can result from repeat episodes of reversible myocardial ischemia that occur during planned, temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce peri- and post-procedural adverse events.
The Impella RP  System is indicated for providing circulatory assistance for up to 14 days in pediatric or adult patients with a body surface area   1.5 m2 who develop acute right heart failure or decompensation following left ventricular assist device implantation, myocardial infarction, heart transplant, or open-heart surgery.
The Impella 5.0 is a micro axial, catheter-mounted pump that works on the principle of Archimedes  screw.  It is able to generate a total output of 4.0-5.0 L/min at an RPM of 33,000, a step up from its predecessor, the Impella 2.5, which generates a maximum of 2.0-2.5 L/min. The Impella 5.0 sits with its distal end inside the ventricle, across the aortic valve, with its outlet in the proximal aorta (Figure 2). The distal end consists of a 7 French (Fr) pigtail that helps anchor the device inside the left ventricle (LV) and an inlet (proximal to the pigtail) with up to 5 openings, connected to a nitinol-based 21 Fr catheter that houses the motor at the proximal end. Distal to the encapsulated motor housing is the outlet where blood is ejected into the aorta, while distal to the outlet is the differential pressure sensor that assists with positioning the Impella across the aortic valve. The Impella is then connected to a controller system (outside of the body) that helps regulate its function, including manual adjustments of up to 9 different iterations of rotational speed, with commensurate changes in flow and resultant change in cardiac output. The controller system also houses the purge system that infuses dextrose and heparin through the Impella, preventing the blood from contaminating the motor and also preventing clotting.  In addition, it has also been successfully implemented as bridge  in-between  treatments, i.e., transition from one form of support to another, such as ECMO to Impella, Impella 2.5 to 5.0, intra-aortic balloon pump to Impella, etc.
Scope of Work
This Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) will provide services to the Cardiology/Cath Lab Section of the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (MEDVAMC). The MEDVAMC intends, through this procurement, to expedite care to critically ill patients, reduce waste by eliminating the use of less effective devices, have on demand the resources available to provide required services, and to enhance the best possible patient outcomes and patient satisfaction.

<RESPDATE>102517
<CONTACT>Lisa L. Schaupp, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014020735, Email Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health, Clinical Center is conducting a market survey/sources sought to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZONE small business capable of serving the needs mentioned below. This market survey/sources sought announcement is not a request for proposals and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The information from this market research is for planning purposes only and will assist the Government in planning its acquisition strategy. This is strictly market research and the Government will not entertain questions concerning this market research. The Government will not pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of information for responding to this market survey.
<p>The Pharmacy Department in the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland has a need for the procurement of Influenza Virus Vaccine to fulfill the NIH Flu Vaccination campaign. The NIH yearly flu vaccination campaign is one safeguard to ensure that our patients do not become infected from staff members. Flu vaccinations are mandatory for all employees and contractors that might come into contact with our patients. Our program starts in late August each year with the first wave of employees receiving the vaccine being those that provide direct patient care. Once those employees are vaccinated, the flu vaccine is offered to the entire campus and various Institutes throughout the Maryland, Washington D.C. area.</p>
<p>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) determine which strains of influenza will be included in the vaccine each year. This determination is made so that all potential manufacturers have enough time to produce their flu vaccine according to the prescribed guidelines for that year or season. Sometimes the strains will be the same as the previous season and they will change the makeup of the vaccines. This is a known influence on the vaccine market and manufacturers are prepared to deal with this variable from year to year. Thus knowing the exact flu vaccine from which manufacturer can only be determined once this strain determination has been made and the details of the various vaccines from the manufacturers is released to the industry.</p>
<p>Currently the manufacturers for Flu Vaccine are as follows:</p>
<p>CSL Limited GlaxoSmithKline Novartis Vaccines Medimmune<br />ID Biomedical of Quebec Sanofi Pasteur Protein Services</p>
<p>These manufacturers produce either a single vaccine category (e.g. pediatric), or several age specific and or dose size vaccines. The manufacturers for flu vaccines have not changed significantly over the past 8 years.</p>
<p>Because of this these variables NIH is unable to specify their exact yearly requirements past the 2017-2018 season other than the Government estimates to procure approximately 20,000 doses yearly.</p>
<p>Quantities and types of the vaccine will be determined prior to the issuance of a Task Order. As an estimating tool, the following table depicts the quantity and types of vaccines received for the 2017-2018 vaccine ordering season:</p>
<p>Fluzone&reg; Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent Pediatric .25 mL, 10 Pre-Filled Syringes 2 Boxes<br />Fluzone&reg; Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent 5 mL, 10 Doses Multi Dose Vials (MDV) 5 Vials<br />Fluzone&reg; Influenza Vaccine Quadrivalent .5 mL, 10 Single Dose Pre-Filled Syringes 1800 Boxes<br />Fluzone&reg; HIGH DOSE Influenza Vaccine .5 mL, 10 Single Dose Pre-Filled Syringes 160 Boxes<br />Flucelvax Influenza Vaccine .5mL, 10 Single Dose Pre-filled Syringes 2 Boxes</p>
<p>We are requesting that the boxes of preservative-free prefilled syringes be all from the same lot number. The boxes of preservative-free prefilled syringes must be approved by the FDA for administration to ages 4 years old and above.</p>
<p>Mandatory Requirements</p>
<p>-The vaccine must be purchased directly from the Specified US Manufacturer.<br />-The Clinical Center requires delivery of the flu vaccine to occur by August 22 each year.<br />-The delivery must be noted as an inside delivery to the address listed below.</p>
<p>Pharmacy Department <br />10 Center Drive <br />Building 10, Room XXX<br />Bethesda, MD. 20892<br />Attention: To Be Announced</p>
<p>The vendor responses must demonstrate their expertise in the areas described above. Please note that failure to specifically demonstrate capability to provide the required services in your response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of industry's ability to perform these services. The vendor's response shall be in sufficient detail to allow the Government to assess the capability of your firm.</p>
<p>The vendor response shall also include any other specific and relevant information related to the requirements of this project that will enable the Government to determine the capabilities of the company to perform the specialized requirements described in this synopsis. Interested organizations must demonstrate and document in any response submitted to this market survey extensive experience with and the ability to perform all of the specialized requirements elsewhere described.</p>
<p>This notice is a market survey and is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. The Government will not award a Purchase Order or Contract based upon Vendor responses to this announcement. The Government shall not assume any costs for preparing or submitting any information in response to the market survey or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as "proprietary information".</p>
<p>Vendors must send written capability responses by October 25, 2017, 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to Lisa Schaupp, the Contract Specialist at the e-mail address Lisa.Schaupp@nih.gov. For any questions regarding the response submission process, please respond in writing to the email address provided.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS<br />For
<p>ALAMOGORDO FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT, MCKINLEY CHANNEL, PHASE VIII, OTERO COUNTY, NEW MEXICO</p>
<p><br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Albuquerque District has been tasked to solicit for and award a project located within the city of Alamogordo, Otero County, New Mexico. The proposed project consists of reinforced concrete lining of the existing McKinley ditch for approximately 8,100 linear feet. The project begins at the intersection of McKinley Ditch and First Street and proceeds upstream for 8100 feet. Along the way, the channel configuration includes trapezoidal, rectangular with transitions for changes in configuration. The channel includes splitter walls and access ramps. The purpose of the McKinley Channel is to route flood flows from McKinley Canyon through the developed areas of the City of Alamogordo. This is an active channel within residential areas and associated confined work spaces. The project will convey flows from the canyon, through the city to drainage. In addition, the contract includes the necessary utility relocation needed for the construction of the channel and all necessary support.</p>

The specific work includes structural, mechanical, and electrical improvements to the North and South Clearwells that will result in a structurally sound reservoir with improved water quality and reliable operation. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 237110 (Water and Sewer Line and Related Structures Construction) and Business Size Standard of $36.5 Million.<br /><br />The Washington Aqueduct provides potable water to approximately one million people in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia. As part of the water treatment and supply system, the Washington Aqueduct maintains and operates the Dalecarlia and McMillan Water Treatment Plants (WTPs). The North Clearwell is an approximate 612 LF x 162 LF underground structure that is 25' deep and was built in 1904. The North Clearwell is fed by a 72" water main which acts as an influent line at the northwest corner of the Clearwell. The Clearwell effluent and bypass pipes, both 78" in diameter, are located at the south end of the structure. The effluent pipe runs approximately 30' through a sluice gate chamber, in which are four (4) sluice gates, before entering into the South Clearwell. The bypass pipe runs diagonally, in the southwest direction alongside the South Clearwell, and supply water to the Bryant Street Pumping Station.

<DESC>The US Army Research Laboratory (ARL) launched the Open Campus business model in 2014 to enhance collaboration among ARL, academic institutions, small businesses, and industry. The ARL Open Campus lays the foundation for a global science and technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem enabling long-term national security. The joint value proposition created by Open Campus for partner researchers and institutions includes access to unique ARL facilities, Army-relevant data sets, and expertise; generation of joint intellectual property; incubation of spinoff companies for the pursuit of science and technology innovations; and maturation and rapid transition of intellectual property and technologies to the industrial marketplace. ARL is committed to a goal of having 10-15% of its research staff on rotational assignments outside of the laboratory at partner locations, with at least that number of collaborators actively participating at ARL locations.
<p><br />ARL's 4th Open Campus Open House will be held 18-19 October 2017 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. This year's Open Campus Open House is an opportunity to discuss ARL's Open Campus business model, hear details about ARL's strategic research areas, discuss collaboration and partnership opportunities with ARL's scientists and engineers, and tour many of ARL's specialized laboratory facilities. New this year is the opportunity to engage with regional leaders from ARL's extended sites, including a Partner Panel that includes Lockheed Martin, Per Vivo Labs, Lehigh University, and UMass Amherst. Keynote speakers are Mr. Rickey E. Smith, U.S. Army Training &amp; Doctrine Command, on October 18th and SEN Christopher Van Hollen Jr. on October 19th.</p>
<p><br />Of particular note are lab tours and demonstrations from ARL's Human Sciences, Computational Science, Materials Research, Sciences for Lethality and Protection, and Sciences for Maneuver Campaigns. Highlights from these tours include: Stress effects on Soldier performance, high performance computing demos, additive manufacturing, and advances in materials, propulsion, and autonomy.</p>
<p>The link to register and more details on the event can be found at https://www.arl.army.mil/opencampusopenhouse. The registration fee is $55.00, which provides you a seat in the auditorium as well as lunch/refreshments both days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical campaign sessions will be the afternoon of the first day. The schedule is:</p>
<p>12:30-1:15 Analysis &amp; Assessment&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partnering Mechanisms</p>
<p>1:30-2:15 Human Sciences <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Materials Research</p>
<p>2:30-3:15 Sciences for Maneuver <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computational Sciences</p>

<DESC>This publication serves to notify the public that Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, Global Monitoring Division (GMD), has a requirement for aircraft flight and data processing services in Alberta, Canada, and intends to procure these services on a sole source basis.  Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 1901, FAR 13.500(a), the Acquisition and Grant Office (AGO) Western Acquisition Division (WAD), will increase the ceiling, on a single award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract currently in place with Scientific Aviation.
<p>Through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the United States and Canada, a requirement exists to provide approximately 336 hours of research measurements over gas fields in Alberta, Canada with a light aircraft instrumented for real time in situ measurement of oil and gas field emissions. The measurements will include in situ, real time methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. Meteorology will include wind speed and direction. The measurement data will be transmitted to ground stations in real time.  Post flight, within 24 hours, data will be processed to produce gas field emission rates for the prior day's flight.  The aircraft, flight hours, instruments, field staff, data processing software, data processing and data analysis will be provided by Scientific Aviation.  Performance needs to occur prior to winter 2017 and is expected to occur during the months of October and November 2017.</p>
<p>Scientific Aviation is the only known source capable of measuring methane gas leaks in Canada via flight operations.  The firm specializes in providing aircraft suitable for high performance, low altitude, real time measurement of gaseous effluents from oil and gas fields. The company has an integrated a suite of instruments for this purpose and has developed a wind speed and direction system mounted on their research aircraft that is one of its kind. These wind measurements are required for determining the gas fluxes from gas and oil fields. Their pilots are certified to fly at the low altitudes required for the emission studies, and the government knows of no other firm possessing both the equipment and personnel capable of providing the required services.</p>
<p>Scientific Aviation has developed unique software and airborne data process capabilities that allow for transmitting data to ground stations as the plane is making measurements. This allows for a ground controller to modify the flight operations as measurement data is received and for instance methane "hotspots" are detected.  Additional software and computing resources developed by Scientific Aviation allow for analysis and report of high level data within 24 hours of a flight.  This is imperative for planning upcoming flights, as flight paths are oftentimes modified based on analysis of previous flights. <br /> <br />Scientific Aviation has a license from the Canadian Government equivalent of the US Federal Aviation Administration to operate a turbo Mooney research aircraft in Canada, and to operate it at low altitudes.  To gain this license, the aircraft needed to be able to operate under severe icing conditions, and was inspected and certified prior to the granting of the license.  No other research aircraft with the required capabilities of the Scientific Aviation Mooney is known to have this certification.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide services that fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact by October 15, 2017. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to Chad Hepp, Contracting Officer, at Chad.M.Hepp@noaa.gov.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>SECTION IV - STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Project Title: Cataract Intraocular Lenses and Surgical Supplies</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Background</strong></p>
<p>Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) provides surgical services to Native American/Alaskan Native patients throughout the Phoenix Service Unit, Phoenix, AZ. PIMC performs an estimated 450 cataract surgeries a year. One of the most common operations we perform here is for cataracts surgery in which a new intraocular lens (IOL) is used to replace the diseased lens. These lenses are made in a variety of sizes and strengths so that the patient's vision can be restored to as normal as possible.</p>
<p><strong>2. Objective</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to ensure the ready availability of an adequate number of lenses of varying sizes and strengths and surgical supplies so that we can best serve our patient population. Many of our patients needing this operation come from reservations hours away from our facility. It is imperative that we have a steady, dependable supply of lenses so we can use the best lens on the patient the day of their scheduled surgery. It is impossible to preoperatively predict the appropriate size/strength with 100% accuracy and hence the need for the range to be available on the operative day.</p>
<p>The improvement we expect to see is significant. While we are requesting sizes from Diopter/power to range from 6.0 to 27.0, 90% of the lenses we use are between the size of 13.0 and 24.0. It is not uncommon to use four or five lenses of the same size on one operating day. In the past this meant on some days, the ophthalmologist was faced with having to use a less than optimal sized IOL or to reschedule the patient who may have traveled four hours to have the surgery done that day.</p>
<p><strong>3. Requirements</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor will provide a stock range of pre-loaded lenses (IOLs) and foldable multipiece posterior chamber lenses (IOLs). The pre-loaded (IOLs) range from 6.0 diopter to 27.0 diopter will meet our requirement.</p>
<p>For the commonly used pre-loaded (IOLs) sizes 14.0 diopter through 22.5 diopter (18 diopter sizes) PIMC will stock 6-each pre-loaded (IOLs) for a total 108 pre-loaded (IOLs). For the pre-loaded (IOLs) from 6 diopter through 13 diopter and from 23 diopter through 27 diopter (20 diopter sizes) PIMC will stock 3 pre-loaded (IOLs) for a total 60 pre-loaded (IOLs). The total pre-loaded (IOLs) stock is 168 lenses. For the commonly used foldable multipiece posterior chamber (IOLs) sizes 14.0 diopter through 22.5 diopter (18 diopter sizes) PIMC will stock 1-each foldable multipiece posterior chamber (IOLs) for a total 18 foldable muliptiece posterior chamber (IOLs). Stocking at this par level would give us a total stock of 186 lenses. (See Attachment A). PIMC will purchase the initial 186 lenses. Cataract surgery is performed up to 12 days before surgery and any special lens not stocked will be ordered by the COR. The par level will be monitored by the COR and COR assigned will notify the Contractor on what IOLs were used after each day cataracts surgeries were performed. As the IOLs are used and are replaced, the contractor will send PIMC COR a monthly invoice itemizing the cost of replacement. This will ensure that we will always have enough of the most commonly used lenses. IOLs par levels will be adjusted by the COR and Contractor to avoid idle IOLs assets. Idle IOLs assets will be returned to the contractor at no cost to the Government.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide Toric IOLs to our patients with astigmatism and cataracts. We estimate 30 Toric IOLs per year. These are used in elective surgeries and so these lenses will be ordered on an "As-Needed Basis" seven days or more before the date of surgery.</p>
<p>The Contractor will also supply the following products with the Par levels listed. The Contractor will be notified as described above when these products are used and need to be restocked.<br /><br />Item Par Level<br />Part #AS8936-57, Surgical Eye Anterior Packs 30 per month<br />(Note: Items in the packs can be found under CLIN-005 in Price Schedule Section.)</p>
<p>The Contractor will ensure that no IOLs are found upon delivery to have been manufactured in an unusable state (fogged, irregular in shape or inhomogeneous in diopter).</p>
<p>The Contractor will be fully responsible for assuring delivery of adequate lenses as required above. The Contractor will be responsible for delivery of all cataract intraocular lenses and surgical supplies and shall be sterile to meet all industry and regulatory FDA requirements.</p>
<p>Contractor will provide PIMC a web-based ordering system that provides reports for inventory management and capability to order par level IOLs and special order IOLs. If web-based ordering system is not available the Contractor shall provide best means to provide inventory management and ordering processes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Minimum Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>Contractor shall have a minimum of 5 years of experience in production, delivery and support of intraoperative ocular lenses and surgical supplies.</p>
<p><strong>5. Delivery</strong></p>
<p>Delivery of all preloaded IOLs s required within 3 days after receipt of order or sooner. Toric IOLs will be delivered within 7 days after receipt of order or sooner. Surgical packs will be delivered within 15 days of receipt of order or sooner.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>See Solicitation #: 18-247-SOL-00001 for the following sections:</strong></span>&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />SECTION V - BASIS FOR AWDARD</strong></em></span></p>

At the time they were created, these images reflected the field's understanding of visual perception for such patients. But the field has advanced considerably since then, and these static images are considered overly simplistic, inaccurate, and generally unsatisfactory. At the same time, technology has evolved to where it is possible to use video and virtual reality to more authentically demonstrate (or even simulate) the experience of have a blinding disease.<br /><br />As part of the efforts of the NEI 50th Anniversary Planning Committee, the institute seeks the support of experts in blinding diseases, visual psychophysics, and video/virtual reality production to create a scientifically accurate and clinically authentic blindness simulation "experience" that can be used for education, public advocacy, and research purposes and a series of short videos that can be posted online for education and public outreach.<br /><br /><strong>1.2 SCOPE</strong><br /><br />NEI expects to receive scientifically and clinically plausible depictions of common blinding diseases that are of programmatic interest to the institute. These depictions should be delivered to NEI in formats ideal for education, advocacy, research, and wide distribution where appropriate.<br /><br /><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES</strong><br /><strong><br />1.3.1.</strong> NEI requires at least one virtual reality experience that accurately simulates the visual perception of patients living with a common blinding disease that is of programmatic interest to the institute. The end product of this objective will be used primarily for patient advocacy and for the research purposes of the vision science community.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.2.</strong> NEI requires at least two videos that accurately present the viewer with the visual perception of patients living with two different common blinding diseases that are of programmatic interest to the institute. The end products of this objective will be used primarily for education, patient advocacy, and wide distribution to the general public.<br /><br /><strong>2.0 REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />2.1 TASKS</strong><br /><br /><strong>2.1.1.</strong> Work with NEI staff to identify blinding diseases most suitable for simulation. Factors to consider include prevalence and interest as well as technical ones (i.e., ability to model disease, implementation considerations).<br /><br /><strong>2.1.2.</strong> Submit a formal Project Plan to NEI.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.3.</strong> Identify or develop algorithms for modeling the selected diseases and transforming a "normal" video clip into one that represents the perception of a person with the disease.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.4.</strong> Create an augmented reality experience simulating at least one blinding disease.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.5.</strong> For at least two (2) blinding diseases, create videos intended for typical computer monitors that provide the viewer with depictions of what patients with blinding diseases may experience in their daily lives.<br /><br /><strong>2.2 DELIVERABLES</strong><br /><br /><strong>2.2.1.</strong> Submit a formal Project Plan to NEI. This document must contain the following:<br /><strong><br />a)</strong> List of personnel to be involved in the project, and their roles.<strong>&nbsp;<br />b)</strong> Description of the technical approach to simulating the diseases.<br /><strong>c)</strong> Detailed timeline.<br /><strong>d)</strong> An accountability plan to ensure NEI receives project deliverables by the end of FY2018.<br /><strong>e)</strong> Detailed budget.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.2.</strong> Contractor must provide the NEI 50th Anniversary Planning Committee with an immersive virtual reality experience capable of simulating at least one common blinding disease of significant programmatic interest to NEI. The following specific requirements apply:<br /><br /><strong>a)</strong> The augmented reality experience should use Oculus Rift or technology capable of providing a comparably immersive experience.<br /><strong>b)</strong> The system should include eye tracking hardware.<br /><strong>c)</strong> The duration of the viewing experience is to be determined, but expected to be on the order of tens of seconds.<br /><strong>d)</strong> The viewing experience should include both a disease simulation segment and normal viewing segment so the viewer can have a comparative experience.<br /><strong>e)</strong> NEI shall receive one complete system, inclusive of hardware and software (monitor, goggles, eye tracking hardware, etc...).<br /><strong>f)</strong> NEI shall receive the software elements such that they may be installed on additional hardware units.<br /><strong>g)</strong> NEI shall receive instructions for installing software on other systems.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.3.</strong> For at least two (2) diseases, Contractor must deliver two videos intended for display on typical computer monitors that provide the viewer with depictions of what patients with blinding diseases may experience in their daily lives.<br /><br /><strong>a)</strong> Videos shall be in a standard and common format downloadable and playable on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones.<br /><strong>b)</strong> The duration of the viewing experience is to be determined, but expected to be on the order of tens of seconds.<br /><strong>c)</strong> The viewing experience should include both a disease simulation segment and normal viewing segment so the viewer can have a comparative experience.<br /><strong>d)</strong> NEI shall receive the software elements such that they may be installed on additional hardware units.<br /><strong>e)</strong> NEI shall receive instructions for installing software on other systems.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.4.</strong> Once a month, contractor must provide a written and verbal progress report to NEI.

<p>Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Cascading Set-Aside Strategy:
The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.  Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns. The contracting officer  
(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tier order: 
(a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB); 
(b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB); 
(c) all other small business concerns; 
(d) other than small business. 
(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can be made.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
Price (Follow these instructions):
Offeror shall complete the above Price Schedule, with offerors proposed contract line item prices inserted in appropriate spaces. Offerors must also provide all applicable labor rates for the solicited services so they can be compared to the applicable wage determination for compliance with the Service Contract Labor Standards.  
Ensure your representations and certifications are complete in the System for Award Management (SAM)( https://www.sam.gov).  Otherwise, you will need to fill out solicitation Clause 52.212-3 "Offeror Representation and Certifications -Commercial Items", and submit with the quote.   Federal Acquisition Regulations require that federal contractors register in the SAM database at http://www.sam.gov and enter all mandatory information into the system. Award cannot be made until the contractor has registered. Offerors are encouraged to ensure that they are registered in SAM prior to submitting their quotation.
Past Performance:
Provide (3) references of work, similar in scope and size with the requirement detailed in the Statement of Work.  References must include contact information; brief description of the work completed, and contract # (if relevant). Please utilize Attachment 1   Past Performance Worksheet for your references and please submit as part of your quote submission.  References may be checked by the Contracting Officer to ensure your company is capable of performing the Statement of Work. The Government also reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources. 
Technical: The offeror s quote shall be evaluated to determine if the organization has the experience and capabilities to provide the requested services in accordance with the SOW in a timely efficient manner.
Contractor shall demonstrate their corporate experience and approach to meet all requirements stated in the SOW.
Contractor shall demonstrate that their technicians meet the qualification standards stated in the SOW.
Contractor shall provide a quality control plan, which explains the offerors approach to quality control and methodologies.   An example quality assurance surveillance plan is attached, see Attachment 2   QASP and can be utilized as a template.

If you are planning to sub-contract some or all of this work, please provide the name and address(s) of all subcontractor(s) (if applicable) and a description of their planned subcontracting effort.

Veterans Preference Factor (per 852.215-70): The Government shall assign evaluation credit for an Offeror (prime contractor) which is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB) or a Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB). Non-SDVOSB/VOSB Offerors proposing to use SDVOSBs or VOSBs as subcontractors will receive some consideration under this evaluation Factor. 
For SDVOSBS/VOSBs: In order to receive credit under this Factor, an Offeror shall submit a statement of compliance that it qualifies as a SDVOSB or VOSB in accordance with VAAR 852.215-70,  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Veteran-Owned Small Business Evaluation Factors . Offerors are cautioned that they must be registered and verified in Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database (http://www.VetBiz.gov). 
Verified SDVOSBs will receive a 10% price credit (e.g. if a SDVOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $90.00).
Verified VOSBs will received a 5% price credit (e.g. if a VOSB submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $95.00).
For Non-SDVOSBs/VOSBs: To receive some consideration under this Factor, an Offeror must state in its proposal the names of SDVOSB(s) and/or VOSB(s) with whom it intends to subcontract, and provide a brief description and the approximate dollar values of the proposed subcontracts.

If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a SDVOSB, it will receive a 3.5% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $96.50).
If a vendor submits a subcontracting plan where it will be using a VOSB, it will receive a 2.5% price credit (e.g. if this vendor submits an offer of $100.00, it will be evaluated as if it submitted an offer of $97.50).

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

At the time they were created, these images reflected the field's understanding of visual perception for such patients. But the field has advanced considerably since then, and these static images are considered overly simplistic, inaccurate, and generally unsatisfactory. At the same time, technology has evolved to where it is possible to use video and virtual reality to more authentically demonstrate (or even simulate) the experience of have a blinding disease.<br /><br />As part of the efforts of the NEI 50th Anniversary Planning Committee, the institute seeks the support of experts in blinding diseases, visual psychophysics, and video/virtual reality production to create a scientifically accurate and clinically authentic blindness simulation "experience" that can be used for education, public advocacy, and research purposes and a series of short videos that can be posted online for education and public outreach.<br /><br /><strong>1.2 SCOPE</strong><br /><br />NEI expects to receive scientifically and clinically plausible depictions of common blinding diseases that are of programmatic interest to the institute. These depictions should be delivered to NEI in formats ideal for education, advocacy, research, and wide distribution where appropriate.<br /><br /><strong>1.3 OBJECTIVES</strong><br /><strong><br />1.3.1.</strong> NEI requires at least one virtual reality experience that accurately simulates the visual perception of patients living with a common blinding disease that is of programmatic interest to the institute. The end product of this objective will be used primarily for patient advocacy and for the research purposes of the vision science community.<br /><br /><strong>1.3.2.</strong> NEI requires at least two videos that accurately present the viewer with the visual perception of patients living with two different common blinding diseases that are of programmatic interest to the institute. The end products of this objective will be used primarily for education, patient advocacy, and wide distribution to the general public.<br /><br /><strong>2.0 REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />2.1 TASKS</strong><br /><br /><strong>2.1.1.</strong> Work with NEI staff to identify blinding diseases most suitable for simulation. Factors to consider include prevalence and interest as well as technical ones (i.e., ability to model disease, implementation considerations).<br /><br /><strong>2.1.2.</strong> Submit a formal Project Plan to NEI.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.3.</strong> Identify or develop algorithms for modeling the selected diseases and transforming a "normal" video clip into one that represents the perception of a person with the disease.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.4.</strong> Create an augmented reality experience simulating at least one blinding disease.<br /><br /><strong>2.1.5.</strong> For at least two (2) blinding diseases, create videos intended for typical computer monitors that provide the viewer with depictions of what patients with blinding diseases may experience in their daily lives.<br /><br /><strong>2.2 DELIVERABLES</strong><br /><br /><strong>2.2.1.</strong> Submit a formal Project Plan to NEI. This document must contain the following:<br /><strong><br />a)</strong> List of personnel to be involved in the project, and their roles.<strong>&nbsp;<br />b)</strong> Description of the technical approach to simulating the diseases.<br /><strong>c)</strong> Detailed timeline.<br /><strong>d)</strong> An accountability plan to ensure NEI receives project deliverables by the end of FY2018.<br /><strong>e)</strong> Detailed budget.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.2.</strong> Contractor must provide the NEI 50th Anniversary Planning Committee with an immersive virtual reality experience capable of simulating at least one common blinding disease of significant programmatic interest to NEI. The following specific requirements apply:<br /><br /><strong>a)</strong> The augmented reality experience should use Oculus Rift or technology capable of providing a comparably immersive experience.<br /><strong>b)</strong> The system should include eye tracking hardware.<br /><strong>c)</strong> The duration of the viewing experience is to be determined, but expected to be on the order of tens of seconds.<br /><strong>d)</strong> The viewing experience should include both a disease simulation segment and normal viewing segment so the viewer can have a comparative experience.<br /><strong>e)</strong> NEI shall receive one complete system, inclusive of hardware and software (monitor, goggles, eye tracking hardware, etc...).<br /><strong>f)</strong> NEI shall receive the software elements such that they may be installed on additional hardware units.<br /><strong>g)</strong> NEI shall receive instructions for installing software on other systems.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.3.</strong> For at least two (2) diseases, Contractor must deliver two videos intended for display on typical computer monitors that provide the viewer with depictions of what patients with blinding diseases may experience in their daily lives.<br /><br /><strong>a)</strong> Videos shall be in a standard and common format downloadable and playable on desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones.<br /><strong>b)</strong> The duration of the viewing experience is to be determined, but expected to be on the order of tens of seconds.<br /><strong>c)</strong> The viewing experience should include both a disease simulation segment and normal viewing segment so the viewer can have a comparative experience.<br /><strong>d)</strong> NEI shall receive the software elements such that they may be installed on additional hardware units.<br /><strong>e)</strong> NEI shall receive instructions for installing software on other systems.<br /><br /><strong>2.2.4.</strong> Once a month, contractor must provide a written and verbal progress report to NEI. These updates must occur before the third Tuesday of each month so they can be relayed to the entire NEI 50th Anniversary Planning Committee during monthly committee meetings.<br /><br /><strong>2.3 SCHEDULE</strong><br /><br />Contractor must meet the following key milestones:<br /><br /><strong>2.3.1.</strong> Submit their formal Project Plan to NEI by no later than one month after contract award.<br /><br /><strong>2.3.2.</strong> Working prototypes of each deliverable must be demonstrated to NEI by COB Jan 31, 2018.<br /><br /><strong>2.3.3.</strong> Final deliverables due by COB March 31, 2018.<br /><br /><strong>2.4 ASSUMPTIONS</strong><br /><br />&bull; Expertise - The contracting team must have expertise in the following areas:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Clinical aspects of common blinding diseases.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Visual psychophysics<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Virtual reality and video production<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; o Software development<br />&bull; Vendors and Procurement - Procurement of hardware and materials related to this project will be the responsibility of contractor.<br /><br /><strong>3.0 GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY</strong><br /><br />It is not expected that any government resources will be required.<br /><br /><strong>4.0 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</strong><br /><br />We do not anticipate any need for special security considerations related to the project.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons is seeking concerns having the ability for providing Residential Reentry center (RRC) services (in-house RRC beds) and Home Confinement services (home confinement placements) for male and female Federal offenders held under the authority of United States Statutes located in the Cities of Brawley or El Centro, California.
<p><br />Both the RRC services for in-house RRC beds and the Home Confinement services for home confinement placements shall be in accordance with the Federal Bureau of Prisons Statement of Work entitled, "Residential Reentry Center, April 2017. Home Confinement services (for home confinement placements) are specifically defined in chapter 10, programs, of the aforementioned SOW. Additional requirements for these services are referenced throughout the SOW as well. <br /><br />This will be for (an) indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type contract(s) with firm fixed unit prices for Line Item 1 and Line Item 2. <br /><br />The RRC requirement will be for a guaranteed minimum of twelve (12) in-house male inmate beds with an estimated maximum of forty seven (47) in-house male inmate beds, and a guaranteed minimum of two (2) in-house female inmate beds with an estimated maximum of eight (8) in-house female inmate beds for the one-year Base Period; and for a an estimated maximum of forty seven (47) in-house male inmate beds, and an estimated maximum of eight (8) in-house female inmate beds for each of the nine one-year option periods thereafter, if any options are exercised. <br /><br />The Home Confinement requirement will be for a guaranteed minimum of four (4) placements onto home confinement with an estimated maximum of fifteen (15) placements onto home confinement for the one-year Base Period; and for an estimated maximum of fifteen (15) placements onto home confinement for each of the nine one-year option periods thereafter, if any options are exercised.<br /><br />The period of performance for any contract which the Government may award under the terms and conditions of the RFP will be for a one-year base period with a guaranteed minimum and estimated maximum. The additional nine one-year option periods will not include a guaranteed minimum, only an estimated maximum.<br /><br />It is the intent of the Government to award both line items (RRC in-house beds and home confinement placements) to a single provider, as these services are interconnected and rely upon each other to ensure adequate programming and case management of offenders. The Government reserves the right to potentially make an award which is deemed to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>RFP-200-1393-WS will be available on or about August 14, 2017, and it will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov.

Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.
