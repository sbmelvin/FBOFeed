GO TO THE FOLLOWING WEB SITE UNDER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO VIEW THE ENTIRE BAA SOLICITATION FOR FULL DETAILS:  https://www3.natick.army.mil The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and/or exploratory development.  This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2013.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2013. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1. Combat Feeding Equipment and Systems (objectives focus on combat food service equipment for individual and group feeding, and unit/organization equipment); 2. Combat Ration Research and Development; 3. Warrior Systems Technologies (objectives focus on ballistic protection for individuals, integrated protective helmet, modular personnel protection system (MPPS), chemical/biological protection for individuals, flame and thermal protection for the individual soldier, countersurveillance, body worn interactive materials, body-worn systems, hand held devices, and smart-lightweight electronic components/modules for soldier protection, knowledge management and cognitive improvement, biomechanics, materials nanotechnology, lightweight conformal solar cells, anthropometry, advanced protection and integration technologies and systems, warrior performance and soldier-borne power source); 4. Tentage, Fabric Structures and Rigid Wall Shelters; 5. Airdrop - Advanced Personnel and Cargo Airdrop Systems; 6. Textile Technologies; 7. Modeling and Simulation (objectives focus on individual and small unit performance and survivability, and wargaming concept and tool development); 8. Neuroepidemiology; 9. National Protection Center; 10. Warfighter Advanaced Technologies (objectives focus on small, unmanned system technology, individual warrior technology and information operations).  All technical questions may be directed to the respective technical/administrative POC listed under each technical area of interest on the BAA.

The solicitation will be posted on or about 30 Mar 12 via Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.  The due date will be stated in the solicitation.    It is the responsibility of the offeror to review the web page for notice of amendments, updates or changes to the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (a) and in accordance with FAR Part 15 for the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Technology Development (TD) contract. NAVAIR does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. This is a follow on contract to existing Technology Maturation (TM) efforts being performed under contracts N00019-10-C-0070 (BAE Systems), N00019-10-C-0071 (ITT Corporation), N00019-10-C-0072 (Northrop Grumman Corporation) and N00019-10-C-0073 (Raytheon Company) which were awarded as a result of Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N00019-09-R-0238. The objective of the TD phase is to develop a cost effective jammer system to enhance aircraft survivability. NGJ is an electronic attack system that will provide significantly improved Airborne Electronic Attack capabilities against advanced threats through enhanced agility and precision within jamming assignments, increased interoperability and expanded broadband capability for greater threat coverage against a wide variety of radio frequency emitters. Initially, the NGJ system will be integrated on the EA-18G tactical aircraft to replace aging ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System pods.
<p><br />The successful offeror in the TD phase will be required to mature and demonstrate critical technologies, complete the system architecture, and complete the requirements derivation and decomposition to subsystems. The TD phase will include: (1) Technology Readiness Assessments (TRAs) that substantiate Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 for Increment 1 (mid-band) Critical Technology Elements (CTEs); (2) System Designs to a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) to establish the functional and allocated baselines for Increment 1; and (3) Refining technical trade space including those to improve affordability, system efficiency, and host platform compatibility.</p>
<p>The Government intends to release a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in early April 2012, including sections L&amp;M. Industry input will be sought prior to the release of the Formal RFP in mid June 2012. Proposals will be required 60 days after Formal RFP release.</p>
<p>Publicly releasable unclassified documentation such as the RFP sections A-M will be posted directly on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website (http://www.navair.navy.mil/) and listed under "Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations" as solicitation number N00019-12-R-0035. All subsequent RFP amendments and publicly releasable documentation will reside on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage and will not be posted to any other website to include FedBizOpps.</p>
<p>Unclassified documentation with distribution statement restrictions such as the Statement of Work and Contract Data Requirement s Lists (CDRLs) will be made available through a secure website that will serve as an unclassified virtual bidder's technical library. Other documentation to include Industry Day briefs, the voluntary interested vendors list, and Industry Day Questions &amp; Answers will be posted to this library as well. Access to this library will be restricted to potential Prime Contractors. A list of all classified documentation will be hosted on the technical library along with procedures for access to these documents. Potential Contractors are asked to submit comments, questions, and requests for additional information directly to Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil or by phone at (301) 757-7086.</p>
<p>Please note that potential Prime contractors will need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate and NAVAIR Applications (APPS) domain account to access the unclassified virtual bidder's external library. If a potential contractor does not already possess a PKI, please consult the following site for details on how to obtain a compliant Medium Assurance PKI certificate: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html. Be advised that this process can nominally take several weeks to complete.</p>
<p>Potential Contractors must meet the requirements of the DD 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. To request access to the secure web site and to request transmittal of the classified documentation, potential Prime Contractors must contact the contract specialist, Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil, with the following information: Company name, classified mailing address, phone number, email address (if available), current CAGE number, DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) number and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Potential contractors shall acknowledge that no dissemination of any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement will occur in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations (DD Form 2345). Upon review of your written request, verification of your status and acknowledgement of the contractor's responsibility under the U.S. Export laws and regulations, the classified documentation, APPS account application and web site access instructions (https://www site address, user name, and password) will be provided.</p>
<p>Prime Contractors shall be required to have completed the design effort for a NGJ system prototype prior to entry into TD. The Government will evaluate only those offerors' proposals that include a copy of a NAVAIR Design Readiness Review 2 (DRR2) letter stating that the exit criteria for a DRR2 has been met, establishing a product baseline for the offeror's NGJ system prototype. DRR2 is a tailored version of a Critical Design Review (CDR). The DRR2 will ensure a reasonable expectation of characterizing operational effectiveness and suitability of the design, and a plan to demonstrate technical maturity of at least a TRL 6 by the end of TD. Entry Criteria for the DRR2 shall be in accordance with the DRR2 checklist (tailored NAVAIR SETR CDR checklist). The DRR2, as a minimum, shall include: Mutually agreed to topics from the DRR2 entry criteria, presentation of the Product Baseline, and CTE Technology Readiness Assessment. Firms that have not conducted a DRR2 but are interested in competing as a TD Prime Contractor must contact Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil, or by phone at (301) 757-7086, no later than 29 June 2012 to obtain the DRR2 checklist and schedule a design review.</p>
<p>Any prospective offeror who believes that their NGJ TD proposal will require submission of information protected as Special Access Required (SAR) or Special Compartmented Information (SCI) must contact their SAR or SCI Sponsor in addition to the Department of the Navy Special Access Programs Coordinator for SAR program related requests or the PEO(T) Intelligence Officer for SCI related requests as early as possible (point of contact information may be obtained from Kara Briscoe at kara.briscoe@navy.mil or at (301) 757- 7086). This is in order to allow the appropriate coordination to occur as early as possible and to gain the requisite approval from the SAR or SCI Sponsor, prior to any submittal of SAR/SCI information. Upon approval of the SAR or SCI Sponsor, specific instructions for submission of SAR/SCI information will be provided by the contract Specialist, Kara Briscoe. SAR/SCI information is NOT to be sent to NAVAIR, the buying activity. Interested parties are advised that any classified submission will be subject to review with the SAR or SCI Sponsor.</p>
<p>After release of the draft RFP, prospective prime contractors with their respective subcontractor teams may request one-on-one meetings with the Government to be conducted the week of 23 April. Requests to schedule a one-on-one meeting are to be made to Kara Briscoe (kara.briscoe@navy.mil, or by phone at (301)-757-7086) no later than 16 April 2012.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMNET FOR A PRECISION ION MILLER. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with E.A. Fischione Instruments, Inc. for a Precision Ion Miller. NRL requires a precision ion milling instrument optimized for producing thin transmission electron microscopy samples with the lowest degree of surface damage. The miller shall be an ultra-low energy, gaseous, electron impact ion source with a single, filament-based ion source combined with an electrostatic lens system. The instrument shall be able to produce atomically clean samples for quantitative high-resolution transmission electron microscope images. It shall be capable of both post-FIB processing and for the final thinning of conventionally-prepared specimens. The further requirement that the instrument supports is operation in either point mode for the milling of a specific area of the specimen, or rastered for the creation of increased electron transparent area.<br /> <br />Vendors who feel capable of providing the services stated above shall fully identify their interests and submit written data or other verifiable documentation that demonstrates conclusively the capabilities of their proposed services to meet the stated requirements within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Responses received after 15 days or without the required documentation will be determined non-responsive to the synopsis, and will not be considered.<br /><br />PR#: 68-1053-12<br />

The program focuses on security screener performance enhancements, equipment and procedures design, device usability, ergonomics, human factors interventions, long-term research, and test and evaluation. As the terrorist threat against transportation venues has evolved and advanced technologies have developed, the consideration of human factors and operator performance is tantamount to the effectiveness of the aviation security system.

<p>PROJECT: New United States Courthouse - Los Angeles, California<br />BUILDING TYPE: Courthouse and Federal Office Building<br />SIZE: 600,000 GSF<br />PARKING SPACES: 110 Controlled-Access Structured Parking <br />BUDGET: ECCA $322,000,000<br />GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION: State of California<br />SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE: None</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Public Buildings Service (PBS) seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, engineers, and construction professionals to design and construct federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, durability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design and Construction services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy goals, security requirements, and achieve at least a LEED Gold certification. This facility will be designed in English units.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for a negotiated Design-Build (DB) construction contract for the new United States Courthouse in Los Angeles, CA. This acquisition encompasses the design and construction of the offices and related space (courtrooms, chambers and other special use space) as required for the U.S. District Court; U.S. Marshals Service; GSA field office; Department of Homeland Security - Federal Protective Service; and trial preparation space for the Office of the U.S. Attorney, and the Federal Public Defender. The facility includes 110 controlled-access, non-public parking spaces inside the completed structure. The newly constructed courthouse shall be located on GSA owned property, on a site between Broadway, Hill, First and Second Streets in the Civic Center area of downtown Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>The total space requirement consists of approximately 600,000 gross square feet, available for use by the federal government for personnel, furnishings and equipment no later than March 2016. The building will be designed and constructed in English units. The estimated total design/build cost is between $312,000,000 and $322,000,000 with occupancy planned for the year 2016. The scope of required Design/Build Services may include, but not be limited to, the following: design/construction documents and construction work, which consists of providing all labor, equipment, and materials for a complete build-out of the Federal Courthouse. The facility will have substantial electrical and HVAC requirements.</p>
<p>The selection process will utilize the Best Value Tradeoff process as stipulated within the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and the Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures in Subpart 36.3 of the FAR. This project is an opportunity in Design and Construction Excellence that must integrate the building into the fabric of the surrounding community and create a new Federal landmark in the heart of Los Angeles that represents the dignity of the U.S. Government. The courthouse must express solemnity, integrity, rigor and fairness.</p>
<p>The selection process will include two phases: <br />&bull; Phase I, the Request For Qualifications (RFQ) leading to selecting a short list of 3 Design-Build offerors, who will be invited to participate in:<br />&bull; Phase II, the comprehensive Request for Proposal (RFP) competition and selection of the design/build offeror.</p>
<p>A single, firm, fixed-price contract with award fee may be awarded for all design beyond a program of requirements and all construction services. All work will be performed in accordance with GSA authorized and approved standards. In consideration for the preparation of the Phase II proposal, GSA will pay a stipend to the two non-selected offerors.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be open to both large and small business firms. The firm (if not a small business concern) shall be required to present an acceptable small business subcontracting plan in accordance with FAR 19.7, as part of its proposal.</p>
<p>Consideration is open to established, qualified firms licensed to perform professional services (FAR 22.1102 and 22.1103), which currently have active, properly staffed offices within the continental United States (including subcontractors).</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically on or about February 6, 2012 on the Internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal conference is scheduled:</p>
<p>Date: February 22, 2012</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, intends to issue a solicitation to acquire professional services to obtain data collection and analysis from a field operational experiment (FOE), to assess driver adaptation to vehicle-based crash warning and avoidance products based on long-term exposure in a naturalistic driving environment. The primary objectives of the FOE are to assess the safety impact and determine driver acceptance of crash warning and avoidance systems. Participants in the FOE will be recruited to drive instrumented vehicles equipped with crash warning and avoidance products in place of their personal cars, driving wherever, whenever, and however they choose. The driving is thereby largely unmanaged by the Contractor and derives, instead, from the personal mobility needs of the individual participants. The primary deliverables from the FOE will be a dataset that captures driver-vehicle performance and the driving environment, and an analysis of this dataset. <br /><br />Objective and subjective data will need to be collected and analyzed to meet the FOE objectives. Objective data are obtained based on observable evidence, undistorted by emotion or personal bias of the FOE participants. Objective data generally consist of numerical and video data that capture host vehicle states and maneuvers, surrounding traffic, system operation, and driver behavior. The Contractor will acquire/lease the vehicles and will provide and install data acquisition systems to collect numerical and video data.
<p>Subjective data are collected to obtain driver background information before participation in the FOE, and to assess driver perception and opinion of the crash warning and avoidance products in terms of ease of use and learning, willingness to use, and safety impact after their participation in the FOE.<br />This will be a Full and Open competitive acquisition conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 for this acquisition with a small business size standard of 500 for the number of employees. The estimated release date of the solicitation will be on or about May 15, 2012. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days following the issuance of the solicitation. The solicitation will be issued utilizing the following contract types: Firm-Fixed-Price and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee. <br />The performance period of this contract will be sixteen months from date of contract award. The contract will include a twelve month option period if exercised by the Government, which will extend the performance period to twenty-eight months from date of contract award.</p>
<p>The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue Request for Proposals (RFP) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP or amendments will not be available. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available in electronic format only from the Government-wide Point of Entry at the Federal Business Opportunities website at the following address: https://www.fbo.gov/. Potential offerors desiring to receive electronic notification of the solicitations posting and availability for downloading must register at the FedBizOpps site.

<a href="mailto:jriccomini@usgs.gov">jriccomini@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The USGS, OAG Sacramento, intends to enter into sole source negotiations and to award non-competitively an IDIQ contract contract with CLS America of Lanham, MD for Argos satellite data collection and transmission services.
Argos is a satellite based data collection and geo-location system which is increasingly used by the USGS to track the movement of migratory wildlife (migratory birds and polar bears are common applications).  A small satellite transmitter called a platform transmitter terminal, or PTT, is affixed to the animal of interest and beams either a Doppler based or GPS based signal through the Argos satellite system, tracking the location of the animal with an accuracy of up to several meters.  PTT are low power < 1 watt.  Due to the increasing research focus on climate change, which bears on polar bears as related to the loss of sea ice, and the concern over avian influenza, which bears on migratory birds as intercontinental disease vector, the USGS has been employing more PTTs in the past several years than ever before.  Each active PTT incurs data transmission charges through the Argos system.
The Argos system has been operational since 1978.  It was established under an agreement between the National Oceanic and Atomospheric Adminsitration (NOAA), the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the French NASA equivalent, the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).  Japan, the European Union, and India have since joined the Argos system via decisions to fly Argos equipement on their satellites.  In 1986, CNES created a subsidiary, the Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS), to operate, maintain, and commercialize the Argos system.  Also, in 1986, Service Argos, Inc. and North American CLS were created to service North American customers.  In 2006 those two companies merged to form CLS America, Inc., the single company that can provide access to the Argos system for North American users.  For North American customers, such as the USGS, the only access to the Argos system, which is critical to the success of the USGS telemetry program, is through CLS America, Inc.
This notification is provided to the public because it is considered a "contract action" which requires synopsis.  For the reasons discussed above, the UGS intends to enter into sole source negotiations with CLS in accordance to FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(16)(ii), any other responsible sources may submit a capabilities statement or proposal which will be considered by the USGS, provided it is submitted by the closing date of this announcement.  No solicitaion will be issued.
This announcement and any resulting modification conform to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-57 dated 15 Mar 2012.  
For further information please contact Joseph Riccomini, Contract Specialist, at 916-278-9347 or jriccomini@usgs.gov.

<a href="mailto:judith.a.kibler@usace.army.mil">USACE District St. Louis</a>
<DESC>There are three major projects to this effort at the Kansas City Veterans Administration Medical Center; each one is comprised of several smaller pieces.  The work consists of renovating 2 and one half floors within occupied medical center in the main tower, building 1. The designs for these projects have been completed by two separate A/E firms.  We will be soliciting proposals from qualified and experienced Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concerns.  <br>Project 589-362, Renovate 7E Dialysis - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building for operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, asbestos abatement, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, communications and other work necessary for a complete and functional dialysis unit.   There will be special water requirements for Dialysis, a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system and Dialyzing Acid system will be required.  Existing Dialysis units are portable and will be relocated and used in the new area.  <br>Project 589-363, Renovate 5th Floor Inpatient Surgery - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building Inpatient Surgery Ward and Ambulatory Surgery Operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, and furnish labor and materials and perform work for Inpatient Surgery as required by drawings and specification.   There will be special rooms for Spinal Chord Patients and singular bed rooms for other patients including Infection Control rooms.  This Project will be completed in two phases, East first then West side for final construction.  <br>Project 589-367, Renovate 10th Floor for Inpatient Psychiatry - this project will construct a state of the art Inpatient Psychiatry ward that will accommodate patient needs to include space consideration for a treatment population of highly complex psychiatric patients comprised of general psychiatry patients, female psychiatry patients, geriatric psychiatry patients and psychiatry patients with complex medical needs. Specific attention will be given to space requirements for the protection of patient privacy, gender specific bathroom/shower areas, areas for group activities and the safety/security precautions for both patients and staff members. The 10th floor will have special Patient Safety requirements for suicide prevention. This project will be completed in 2 phases, East first then patients on the West side will be moved to the new space on the West side and West side construction will begin.  <br>The work on the 5th, 7th, and 10th floors will be concurrent.  Some work (heavy demolition, core drilling, high noise generation) will need to be scheduled other than normal business hours.  Because this is renovation work and not new construction, experience working in an operating medical facility is vital.  The VA will require the prime contractor to have documentable experience showing completed projects of similar size and scope in a hospital environment, their ability to manage subcontractors, vendors and employees within the facility and respect boundaries (noise, infection control, physical, etc). <br> <br><br>

 SET-ASIDE STATUS:   N/A
SUMMARY:
The Construction and Valuation Section (C&V) of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s Loan Guaranty Service (LGY) is responsible for the quality of appraisal reports on properties offered as security for VA guaranteed loans.  Historically, lenders submitted appraisal requests by telephone to a local VA Regional Office (RO).  Each RO managed a fee appraiser panel for its jurisdiction.  The fee appraiser panel is comprised of VA-approved independent appraisers.  VA assigned the appraisal to an approved fee appraiser located in or near the area where the subject property was located.  The completed appraisal report was mailed or hand-delivered to the RO for review and subsequent issuance of a Certificate of Reasonable Value (CRV) by a VA Staff Appraiser.
The CRV forms were later replaced by Notifications of Value (NOV).  As automation advanced, lenders started requesting appraisals electronically and an automated VA system provided the name and contact information for the assigned appraiser.
Shortly thereafter, VA began authorizing lenders to perform reviews of completed appraisal reports and issue NOVs through the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP).  The lender's Staff Appraisal Reviewer (SAR), usually an underwriter employed by the lender, received training by VA staff on the review process and issuance of the NOV.  This procedure currently remains in effect.  Although LAPP is a voluntary program, at this time approximately 96% of the total volume is processed under this program.
In 2002, VA completed a nationwide initiative that consolidated 46 ROs with loan guaranty operations to nine (9) Regional Loan Centers (RLCs).  This allowed some efficiency; however, as VA moves forward, it is essential that proven technological advances be taken advantage of in order to improve resource management and to continue providing quality benefits to our nation's veterans, in a more cost efficient manner.  This requirement will support the procurement of Automated Appraisal Management Services (AMS) and Automated Valuation Model (AVM) services to further enhance the appraisal review process, thereby improving the oversight functions of C&V.
Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) objectives are listed below:
1.	Improve the credibility and quality of individual appraisal reports.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized scoring method and metrics for appraisals.
b.	Identify systemic quality issues.
2.	Improve the quality of individual appraiser performance.
a.	Create quality benchmarks and standardized metrics for individual appraisers.
b.	Identify appraiser-specific quality issues and deficiencies.
c.	Contribute to appraiser-specific remediation plans, including identifying competency gaps requiring training.
d.	Contribute to the development and refinement of role-specific training curriculum.
3.	Automate, streamline, standardize, and improve the appraisal review process.
a.	Continuously enhance the collection, reporting and accuracy of data, product features, integration, process/service design, and usability. 
b.	Leverage existing resources to perform targeted and more detailed oversight. 
c.	Improve the quality and consistency of the appraisal review process.
d.	Reduce the time and cost associated with processing an individual appraisal review.
4.	Decrease risk to Loan Guarantee (LGY).
a.	Reduce risk of fraudulent/non-credible valuations.

The scope of work will include project management, AMS and AVM services, associated training, customer service, operational data reporting, IT and Online Accessibility of Information (to provide system security, establish protocols, schedule and conduct maintenance, provide search/sort/and retrieval options, QAP and recovery plan), audit, and oversight.  A proven and previously fielded Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product is required which must be capable of integration with VA systems.  The COTS product must be available at the time of award and the initial implementation of AMS and AVM services shall encompass the design and integration of these services into the C& V environment within six (6) months of contract award and ensure future enhancements align with the Change Management Action Plan.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. 
The Government intends to make one award as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contract (ID/IQ) will have a five (5) year period of performance. The solicitation will be issued during the 1st Quarter of 2012.  Proposals are anticipated in approximately 30 days from the RFP distribution date.

<DESC>30 Mar 12:&nbsp; Sources Sought <br />A. INTRODUCTION <br />1. This is a Sources Sought synopsis being conducted pursuant to FAR Part 10, Market Research. This is for planning purposes only and there is no solicitation available at this time. <br />2. This is an initial step in the planning process for the Electromagnetic Opposing Force acquisition currently titled EM OPFOR. <br />3. The 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, seeks to identify potential sources to provide Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) expertise and Electromagnetic Spectrum Opposing Force (EM OPFOR) engineering services to the USSTRATCOM Joint Electronic Warfare Center (JEWC) EM OPFOR mission located at Lackland AFB, TX. The mission of the EM OPFOR is to replicate a coherent, realistic EM environment (EME) capable of mirroring adversary and civilian infrastructure in order to train and enhance EM capabilities, processes, and TTP proficiency across the Department of Defense (DOD) and USG, and produce comprehensive after-action reports (AAR) from the findings of these activities/assessments. United States (US) forces must train in a realistic environment as mandated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs CJCSI 3500-series joint instructions. The EM OPFOR allows US forces to do that by providing an EME that is representative of what the warfighter will see when deployed (i.e. congested and contested EMS). The EM OPFOR is the dynamic and technically advanced adversary in exercise scenarios (i.e. the &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo;). The EM OPFOR deploys to austere locations (training ranges, test facilities, etc.) and creates realistic EME where before there was nothing; thus allowing full spectrum, joint, live-virtual-constructive EM activities to take place. The EM OPFOR deploys and operates current/emergent wireless communications and network technologies to include but not limited to VHF/UHF radios, satellite communications, cellular communications (e.g. GSM, CDMA, EVDO, HSDPA, etc.), wireless communications and devices (e.g. WiFi, WiMAX, cameras, survey tools). They design, implement and operate adversary command, control, communications and computer (C4) architectures in support of customer requirements. EM OPFOR also operates Electronic Warfare Support (ES)/Electronic Attack (EA)/Radio Frequency Direction Finding (RFDF) equipment (see enclosure 1 for equipment list) in order to prosecute US forces and assess potential US vulnerabilities. Moreover, the EM OPFOR is involved in most aspects of the joint exercise life cycle (JELC) specifically: exercise scenario development, scripting, execution oversight, scenario injects and debrief. <br />4. The North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330 , Engineering Services (Military and Aerospace Equipment and Military Weapons), which has a small business size standard of $35.5M. <br />B. CAPABILITY PACKAGE AND EVALUATION: The Government will identify competitive firms by evaluating the capabilities packages using the following evaluation criteria. Potential offerors should be specific in referring to capabilities in the technical areas stated below. <br />The following is considered mandatory in meeting the requirements of the EM OPFOR contract: The company/teaming arrangement must posses the knowledge and ability to: 1. Target set infrastructure development and deployment, electronic monitoring, RFDF signal intercepts, intrusion and vulnerability assessment support <br />2. OPFOR C4 architectures scalable to meet customer requirements in support of exercises and real world operations and determine, develop, and replicate credible hostile electronic warfare support (ES) activities utilizing COTS/GOTS equipment. <br />3.

If the classification will expire before the anticipated performance period, include a statement acknowledging that fact. 9For more information on the definition or requirements, refer to http://www.sba.gov.)<br /><br />Please note that failure to submit all information requested will result in a contractor being considered &lsquo;NOT INTERESTED' in this requirement.<br /><br />Firms that meet the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit their responses to the attention of Richard Childres, Contract Specialist (richard.childres@rl.af.mil) with an email copy to Janis Norelli, Small Business Specialist (janis.norelli@rl.af.mil).

<DESC>The CTII system creates a network that links aircraft with each other and with ground stations. SIPRNET users can log into the CTII network using a computer loaded with Tracker software, send/receive messages, and track CTII-equipped aircraft. The CTII system has roll-on/off capability for multiple aircraft platforms. Within each satellite footprint, a single CTII is configured as a Control and Relay Station (CRS). In this mode, the equipment operates as the network master for a satellite channel and defines the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame boundaries by periodically transmitting a start-of-frame message. The other CTIIs within the satellite footprint are configured as In-Transit Units (ITUs). ITUs log-in with the CRS and are assigned a time slot within the frame for transmitting GPS-based position reports. Other portions of the frame are available for text messages, tactical information, and other types of data.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for purposes of conducting market research.

<p>The Air Force is in the process of preparing documentation to gain the required approval to issue a sole source Justification &amp; Approval (J&amp;A) for proposal to DiagnoSYS Systems, Inc. which has supported the Air Force in this capacity for the past several years. Statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. <br /><br />This sources sought synopsis is for information and budget planning only and does not constitute a solicitation, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.</p>

The information provided is considered market research and may be utilized by the AF in developing its acquisition strategy Statement of Objectives, and Performance Specifications. Any proprietary information that is submitted may be used as a general concept but specific information will be safeguarded as proprietary, if so marked.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to information received will be normally considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses must be submitted to Ashley Meibos at Ashley.meibos@hill.af.mil by: 20 MAR 2012 by close of business 4:30 Mountain Standard Time. Send questions electronically directly to Ms. Meibos.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office of Training and Career Development Division (TCDD) requires online Language Learning Services. TCDD requires an on-line self-paced language learning service that is easy to use and provides the opportunity for USCIS employees to utilize personal time and equipment to build their language skills. This language learning service has the potential to reach approximately 12,000 USCIS employees and it estimated that thirty percent of the USCIS population might utilize this service. <br /><br />The Government wishes to explore transitioning from a license based externally hosted product where access is controlled by a specific number of licenses and requires account management by USCIS personnel, to an externally hosted language service that is commercially available, configurable for self-managing access, scalable and flexible.
<p>Interested vendors please provide commercially available information to address the above in the following scenarios:</p>
<p>1.1. Enterprise Access - For all personnel (USCIS Staff would have open access to the service and accounts would be&nbsp;self-managed via self-registration)<br />1.2. Percent of population Access - Only a certain number of users could be logged in at one time and&nbsp;accounts are self-managed via self-registration<br />1.3. Actual Use - Charges incurred only on actual use of the services and accounts are self managed via self-registration<br />1.4. Any other commercially available scenario to address the above future state.</p>
<p>The on-line language catalog shall include at a minimum the following 29 languages:</p>
<p>Arabic, Chinese (Mandarin), Dari, Dutch, English (As a second language), Filipino (Tagalog), French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Pashto, Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Latin America), Spanish (Spain), Swahili, Swedish, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese.</p>

It does NOT constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQ), Invitation for Bids (IFB), a promise to issue a formal acquisition or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Also, the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or Sources Sought Notice, or otherwise pay for information, inquiries, or the Government's use of such information.

<p>PROJECT AREA: The USDA-Forest Service (USDA-FS) Viburnum Trend Mining Area ("Site" or "VT") consists of National Forest System (NFS) lands distributed over several hundred square miles with mixed ownership (federal, private, and other). The work specified in this Statement of Work relates to USDA-Forest Service lands only. The Site is included in two Mark Twain National Forest (MTNF) Purchase Units: the Salem/Potosi District and the Fredericktown District. The Salem/Potosi Unit encompasses land in parts of Crawford, Dent, Iron, Reynolds, Shannon, and Washington Counties. The Fredericktown Unit is located east of the Glover Smelter, within Iron and Madison Counties. The MTNF is managed for multiple uses including: outdoor recreation, range, timber, wilderness, minerals, watershed, and habitat for fish and wildlife. Within the MTNF boundary, most private property (non-NFS) is concentrated along major roads or along stream valleys.</p>
<p>The Viburnum Trend or "New Lead Belt", which lies beneath the Salem/Potosi Unit, is an area of lead, zinc, copper, and silver mineralization. The ore body was discovered in 1955 and is over 500 feet (ft.) below ground surface (bgs). Seven of the 10 developed mines are currently in operation within the Salem/Potosi Unit boundary. Two smelters, Buick and Glover, were opened in 1968 but neither is currently operating. The Buick smelter is located within the Salem/Potosi Unit boundary. The Glover smelter is located west of the Fredericktown Unit.</p>
<p>A Preliminary Assessment (PA) was completed in September 2011, and included a Sampling and Analysis Plan for a Site Investigation (SI). The SI was authorized and the SI Report is in draft development as of present. The primary potential releases investigated were elevated levels of lead, zinc, and cadmium. Both the PA and SI information will be available to potential proposers to assist in response to the Request for Proposal for a VT Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis. A copy of the PA and available SI information will be made available as an attachment to the solicitation when issued. Copies WILL NOT be provided at this time.</p>

<a href="mailto:john.ducote@navy.mil">john.ducote@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>GOVERNMNET SOURCES SOUGHT  REQUEST FOR INFORAMTION (RFI) for Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Scavenge fans.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  

Fans should be of a form-fit-function equivalent design to the current baseline LCAC Scavenge fans as described herein, with minimal or no craft modifications required.  This market survey in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies.  

Background info: The LCAC Scavenge Fans are a vital part of the ETF40B gas turbine combustion air intake filtration systems. There are four (4) scavenge fans installed on each craft, one for each engine intake. The swirl tube and hook vane Intake filters are designed to filter out sand and solid particulates and due to these particles being heavier they fall to the bottom of the filter housing where the scavenge Fans remove the water, sand and solid particulates and discharge it overboard.
 The main engine filtration system requires the scavenge fans to remove approximately 10 percent of the engine total air flow.  The scavenge fans are a hydraulically driven vane axial design. 

NSWC PCD seeks alternate fan designs that will satisfy the performance requirements of the scavenge fan, and upon evaluation of the sources, intends to down-select one or more fans for qualification and operational testing.  The primary objective is to identify one or more new sources for replacement scavenge fans at reduced cost and increased availability, compared to the current fan.  The following is an overview of the specifications for each fan: 

	Operate with MIL-L-23699 synthetic lube oil supplied by the LCAC gear pumps at 3000 PSI and 7.5 GPM
	Provide 2170 CFM air flow at 12 inches H2O static pressure rise
	Constructed of corrosion resistant materials
	Withstand constant exposure to moist marine environment and salt spray
	Fan impeller resistant to erosion- withstand continuous ingestion of air/water mixed with sand and particulates without undue performance degradation over time
	Not significantly exceed current fan size envelope of 12 inch overall diameter x 13 inch overall length
Responses
Responses to this RFI should include supporting materials that provides a demonstration of your companys capabilities, experience, and overall understanding of the evaluation criteria that NSWC Panama City Division has identified.
  The following information is requested (please indicate if the information is an estimate or actual). A development cost ROM is requested where an off-the-shelf estimate is not available for the criteria listed above.

1.	Description of the fan or fan technology as it applies to the evaluation list above
2.	Product Development history and status
3.	Product application and history of fielded systems
4.	Installation and integration requirements
5.	ROM cost and development schedule for a prototype system
6.	ROM cost and lead time 
7.	US Military applications including points of contact

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award sole source contract.  This is not a solicitation.  The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island (Network Contracting Office (NCO 1 - New England)  650/90C intends to negotiate and award a contract for research services to W. Xia, small business, sole-proprietor, Boston, MA (DUNS: 806952458).
The research and services are described as follows: The Contractor shall identify biological markers of disease and design, develop, implement, test and provide assays for said biomarkers, to be used in conjunction with near-infrared optical spectroscopy for the minimally invasive detection, diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative disorders, including mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). It is expected that this work will be an implementation of the concepts outlined in Xia, et al. Arch Neurol. 2009; 66(2):190-199. Performance shall be provided in close collaboration with Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA (Bedford VAMC) and according to specifications developed jointly by Bedford VAMC and Contractor.
The data, assays and services provided shall be comprised of: 1) Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to examine in vivio levels of beta-amyloid (A-beta)
oligomers, monomeric A-beta ?of various peptide lengths and other putative biomarkers for AD and related disorders in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue of patients with sporadic AD at various stages, including very early or pre-symptomatic AD. 2) Acquisition and delivery of data and demonstration of the correlation of assayed biomarkers in vivo with "pre-symptomaitc" AD and the prognostic value of such biomarkers for predicting progression to overt clinical dementia. 3) Correlation of peripheral fluid and/or tissue assays with more clinically validated biomarkers, such as CSF A-beta/?tau ration, PIB-PET imaging, and anatomic or functional MRI imaging data. 4) Correlation of biological markers predictive for progression to dementia with near-infrared spectroscopy. 5) Longitudinal studies demonstrating utility of peripheral biological markers of AD, near-infrared spectrosocopy and both together for monitoring progression of AD. 5) A diagnostic algorithm incorporating demonstrated prognostic value of near-infrared optical spectroscopy plus plasma AD biomarkers for predicting progression of "pre-symptomatic" individuals to overt clinical AD.   The authority for this action is FAR6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice contains information current through FAC 2005-57.  The NAICS is 5141712.  The FSC/PSC is AN92.  No solicitation  will be posted to this site.

Expression of Interest Sought
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) currently occupies 9,085 net usable square feet of clinical space in a building under lease in Huntsville, AL, and has a requirement for a short term lease of this same square footage in the following delineated area.
The offered building must be located within the following boundaries:
North - Pelham Ave SW
East -    Brandon Street SW
South - Marsheutz Ave SW
West - Princeton Blvd SW
Building cannot be within a 100 year flood plain.
The VA seeks to lease approximately 10,000 rentable square feet of clinical space located on one or two floors; if the space is located on two floors, those floors must be contiguous.  The rentable square footage should yield 9,085 usable square feet of space.  The lease term requirement is for four years with one year firm and the space must be available for occupancy by January 1, 2013.  The VA seeks a full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent).
The VA will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  In making the determination for lease award during the solicitation phase of this procurement the VA will consider, among other things, the costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs,  replication of tenant improvements and IT/telecommunications infrastructure.
Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include: building name, address and age; total square footage available (ANSI/BOMA) office rentable and usable, and its location within the building; date of space availability to commence tenant improvements; rental rate per ANSI/BOMA office rentable square foot (indicate core factor) (specify services and utilities included); CAD "as built" floor plans identifying the space offered; parking ratios; loading dock specifications; proximity to public transportation; and information on building ownership.

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement<br><br>1.  The US Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), is issuing this sources sought  in order to perform market research primarily to determine if firms possess the capability to execute the requirements of an anticipated formal solicitation with a contractual capacity of $350M.  This sources sought is not a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Therefore, we invite any size business concerns to provide a capability statement in response to this requirement. This announcement does not obligate the Government to award a contract nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any preparation costs. <br><br>2.  The mission of the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) Program is to provide recurring maintenance (quarterly, semi-annual, and annual) and minor repair services at Government petroleum facilities.  The CEHNC is seeking sources for potential contracts to provide recurring maintenance services including repair and replacement of petroleum equipment and maintenance related construction services at Government petroleum facilities in the continental Unites States (CONUS) and outside of the continental United States (OCONUS).  The contract currently provides recurring maintenance and repair services for petroleum facilities at 100 Army installations, Army Reserves and Army National Guard facility locations and 25 Navy and Marine Corps locations throughout CONUS (all regions).  In the near future, the intention is to extend these services to 21 additional Navy locations in CONUS, 10+ Air Force locations in CONUS, and 10 Army locations in OCONUS (Hawaii, Alaska, Honduras, and Kwajalein Atoll).  <br><br>3.  Scope and Authority.  The contractor will be responsible for properly maintaining and repairing federally funded petroleum systems and other facilities located at the Garrisons and military installations in order to provide compliance with code, criteria, and regulations.  Petroleum system means an underground or aboveground storage tank, connected piping, ancillary equipment and appurtenances, and containment system, if any.  The contractor shall provide all labor, supervision, transportation, supplies, vehicles, tools, materials, facilities, equipment, and incidentals necessary to conduct inspections, preventive maintenance, minor repair, and minor construction on the petroleum systems.  Contractor shall be required to maintain petroleum systems, equipment, and accessories to operate reliably and satisfactorily.  Maintenance tasks are primarily funded by DESC in accordance with the DOD regulation 4140.25-M chapter 8.  Preventive maintenance tasks will be defined as recurrent, periodic or scheduled work to preserve a facility by preventing its deterioration.  Minor and Emergency Repair services will also be required under this contract and will be defined as the restoration of a real property to such a condition that it may effectively be utilized for its designated purpose by overhaul, reprocessing or replacement of constituent parts or materials that have deteriorated by action or elements or usage and that have not been corrected through maintenance.  Periodic testing of systems/components, generally on a quarterly basis, is included within the DESC definitions of maintenance and repair. Other repair may be ordered by the Garrisons for non-petroleum systems such as for separators, piping, tanks, sewers, storm drains, or requirements to meet compliance with applicable laws and regulations.<br><br>4.  The most applicable North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 424710, Oil, Petroleum, and Bulk Stations and Terminals, with a small business size standard of 100 employees <br> <br>5.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT:
<p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole-source firm-fixed price contract to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to support defining an implementation plan for the process involving the biomarker discovery and 24-month diagnostic device initiative for the DTRA Research and Development Enterprise's Diagnostics and Disease Surveillance Division (CBA).</p>
<p>This acquisition is a logical extension of previous work performed by PwC, and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii) under the statutory authority derived from 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), this acquisition will be conducted without providing for full and open competition. This announcement does not commit the Government to make an award.</p>
<p>This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries must include business name, point of contact, address, and telephone number with area code. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice of intent. All documents submitted will not be returned. A determination not to compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The purpose of this project is to maintain the Repetitive Floodloss Website, manage a portfolio database of repetitive loss properties, provide web portal demonstrations to local parishes, and support the State and local parishes through the development of requested repetitive loss data reports. The reason justifying the lack of competition is that UNO-CHART is the only known source available that has provided technical assistance to communities around the state of Louisiana to address National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) repetitive flood loss structure and developed the Repetitive Loss Portal in which local officials are given secure and easy access to data necessary for the grant application process for funds identified for mitigation of the repetitive loss properties. The period of performance is anticipated to be from date of award through July 31, 2014.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes/proposals, however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which, if received by the response date, shall be considered by the agency. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to extend Contract De-AC30-11CC20011for Mobile Loading of TRU
<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:helen.thomas@wipp.ws">Thomas, Helen L</a>
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend the current mobile loading unit support services contract with The S.M. Stoller Corporation (Stoller) at the DOE Carlsbad Field Office site in providing support to Lost Alamos National Laboratory ? Carlsbad Office (LANL-CO) and Washington TRU Solutions (WTS) Central Characterization Project (CCP) in Mobile Loading of transuranic (TRU) waste at generator sites.
The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is a Department of Energy (DOE) facility located 33 miles southeast of the city of Carlsbad in the state of New Mexico.  
The scope of the Mobile Loading Unit support services includes:
-  Providing skilled, trained and qualified personnel to support LANL-CO and WTS Central Characterization Project (CCP) in Mobile Loading of TRU waste at generator sites or other national TRU Program activities;-  Working under CCP?s certified Transportation Program while LANL-CO manages all elements of the program;-  Providing field supervision of the MLU support personnel;-  Administering its personnel, including providing accounting and human resources support (e.g., making payroll, performance evaluations, expense reports, and disciplinary actions);
The proposed contract extension is for six-months from May 1, 2012 until October 31, 2012 with two, three month option periods and the estimated value for the extension and option periods is $3,393,888.00.   
The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  
The present contact with Stoller is due to expire on April 30, 2012.  The proposed contract extension will provide for the continuation of the critical mission of the DOE to dispose of TRU waste safely and protect human health and the environment until an award is made through a competitive acquisition process for a mobile loading unit contractor: a competitive 8(a) procurement for the work is in progress with a new Solicitation DE-SOL-0003653 scheduled to be issued in April, 2012.  Stoller as the incumbent mobile loading contractor is the only contractor, at this time with the unique qualifications to continue the necessary mobile loading activities at the Carlsbad site without a break in service until such award (a new procurement) is made.  A new contractor for this interim period is not practical due to the start up time to meet specialized expertise, training requirements, and badges to perform this service. DOE anticipates award will be made within Fiscal Year 2012.
This is not a formal request for proposals under FAR Part 12, 15, or an invitation for bids under FAR Part 14.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or any other costs incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government. Interested parties believing they have all of the capabilities may submit capability statements to provide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability to meet all of the needs identified above within  required timeframes.  The capabilities statement describing and demonstrating the above shall be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice to the following address:  U.S. Department of Energy, Carlsbad Field Office, P.

<SUBJECT>58--Intent to sole source - Iridium /GPS collars
<SOLNBR>F12PS00282
<CONTACT>Amanda Jordan

<a href="mailto:amanda_jordan@fws.gov">amanda_jordan@fws.gov</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region 7, Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract with Advanced Telemetry Systems (DUNS 049632359).  The Service has a continued need for Iridium/GSP collars for a multi-year research project of Kodiak brown bears.
Maintaining and adding to the inventory of telemetry collars is critical to the success of a high-priority, multi-year research project on Kodiak brown bears.  ATS produces GPS collars that collect detailed, high interval location data that can be downloaded via an iridium satellite system.  The iridium system actually uploads the date form the collars according to a schedule defined by the user and emails all of the date directly to the user of the collars.  Their use precludes the necessity of costly, dangerous, and unreliable aerial telemetry flight in fixed-wing aircraft.  It also precludes the need for fitting aircraft with costly additional radio-telemetry equipment. 
Features offered with the G2110E Iridium/GPS are not offered by collars from other producers.  No other company other than Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS) can provide collars with specification that can meet the USFWSs current requirements, data consistency, and integrity critical to the Southwest Kodiak Brown Bear Project.

Solicitation D12PS00167
1.	Identification of Agency and Contracting Activity.  
Requiring Activity: 	             U.S. Department of the InteriorOffice of the Secretary					1849 C Street NW				Washington, DC 20240			
Contracting Activity:	Department of the InteriorNational Business Center/Acquisition Services Directorate				381 Elden Street, Suite 4000				Herndon, VA 20170
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved. 
This is a limited sources action to award a sole-source logical follow-on with Bronner Group, LLC to provide Administrative Assessment Report Consultation support to the Office of the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs (OS-IA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE).  This sole-source logical follow-on action will result in awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price Task Order to Bronner Group, LLC, a Woman-Owned Small Business, issued against GSA Schedule Contract GS-10F-0052N, under MOBIS Federal Supply Schedule 874, SIN 874-1 Consulting Services, for the estimated amount of $650,000.00.
3.	A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agencys Needs (including the estimated value).
Under the original competitively awarded Task Order to Bronner Group, LLC., the Department of the Interior, Office of the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs (OS-IA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) required an evaluation of the support functions of the BIA/BIE, specific to organization, functionality, performance and customer support to establish a base line for current operations.  This evaluation included an assessment of the degree to which the recommendations based on the report from a previous evaluation entitled, National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), A Study of Management and Administration: The Bureau of Indian Affairs, 1999 was implemented that restructured the BIA/BIE support functions.
The current structure of the support functions in Indian Affairs and their location in the Office of the Assistant Secretary is the result of a restructuring that took place in 2004-2005, pursuant to the 1999 NAPA Report.  The NAPA conducted the study of BIAs management, organizational structure, and administration to identify and recommend remedies to improve quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.  The report also identified gaps in training, policies, resources, and other relevant issues.  Subsequent to the NAPA study, there was a realignment of support functions into the immediate office of the Assistant Secretary and a restructuring of delegations and reporting relationships whereby the support functions report to officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary.  
It has been more than ten years since the NAPA study was issued and the realignment process began.  There was a need to assess the current state of operations, to evaluate if the changes were made and the effect they have had on operations in the regions, field and impact on tribal customers; and accountability to the programs, responsiveness to the requirements of Tribes and regional BIE and BIA staff, effectiveness, timeliness, cost and customer support. There was also a need to evaluate if coordination among the support functions has improved and there are a number of more technical aspects of the NAPA recommendations that should be reassessed.  
The Assistant Secretary wanted to improve coordination and services to BIA and BIE programs and Tribes.  A key measure in this process is the degree of responsiveness and support for BIA and BIE regions and field functions and Tribes.  A close examination of the current state of operation was needed to determine an array of improvements and best practices.  There is a premium on the need to maintain strong accountability and oversight and consistent and adequate policy direction and implementation.
As previously stated, competition was sought and a Task Order was awarded on June 17, 2011 to Bronner Group, LLC., hereto after known as Bronner, for contractor support to examine the current functioning and functionality relative to the organization of the support functions that service the Office of the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs (AS-IA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). The Task Order was issued against GSA Schedule Contract GS-10F-0052N under MOBIS Federal Supply Schedule 874, SIN 874-1 Consulting Services.
The three tasks completed under the original Task Order are as follows:
a)	Task 1  Evaluation/Develop a Baseline - The contractor provided an evaluation of the current support functions and processes being used and their effectiveness in supporting program strategic and mission goals specific to budget, finance, acquisition, human resources, health and safety, information technology, engineering, property management and facilities management. The evaluation established a baseline for the current organization with metrics on the work-flow, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, cost, and customer satisfaction.  Finally, the contractor evaluated other possible models for these functions and the likely impacts on the work-flow, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, cost metrics, and customer satisfaction.  
b)	Task 2  Options and Alternatives - The contractor delivered a range of options from least disruptive to most disruptive to address documented issues in service delivery.  The options and alternatives comprised of a comparison to the Indian Affairs/BIA/BIE organization with those in other Interior bureaus and other agencies.  The evaluation of alternatives and options included use of risk-based assessment to ensure accountability in balance with effective program delivery and efficiency.  Finally, the contractor evaluated information technology tools, business process changes, and other approaches to improve service delivery.  
c)	Task 3  Recommendation/Best Models/Senior Leadership Briefing - The contractor developed a series of recommendations that will implement the options developed in Task 2 to improve the timeliness, effectiveness and efficiency of support services.  This task included the preparation of models that would work with a range of impacts from minimal to maximum.  The recommendations provided an estimate of resource requirements, funding and staffing to implement the options.  
The final recommendations were presented to the Department of the Interior Secretary and Deputy Secretary in February 2012. Both the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary supported the proposed balanced approach for support services that is characterized by shared responsibility, improved service delivery, a new focus on BIEs needs and coordinated communication. The final report was submitted on March 9, 2012.
The purpose of this logical follow-on requirement is for the contractor to provide consultant support to the Office of the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs (OS-IA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) for the Administrative Assessment Report Consultation Logical Follow-On. 
Specifically, Bronner will provide support in the following areas:
a)	Task 1 - Technical and subject matter expert assistance during the Tribal Consultation Sessions - the contractor will provide support in the form of technical and Subject Matter Expert (SME) assistance during the Tribal Consultation sessions. The technical assistance and SME support shall provide background information on the research conducted, the comparison with the NAPA report, and the proposed recommendations to implement the recommendations affecting the administrative support functions of the Indian Affairs organization(s) to allow Tribal leaders attending the consultation sessions a full outline of the factors and efforts.
This Task requires attendance at all Tribal consultation sessions scheduled in April and May 2012 pursuant to the Departments Tribal Consultation policy.
a)	Task 2 - Technical assistance and advice to assist in outlining and summarizing details of the administrative assessment report - the contractor will gather, prepare and analyze information to incorporate into and supplement the administrative assessment report developed in the original Task Order.  This information will come from the tribal consultation sessions that are scheduled in April and May 2012 across Indian Country and will have hundreds of tribal leaders participating.
b)	Task 3 - Consultant/Program Manager support while the Department implements the recommendations formulated in the original Task Order - the contractor will provide Consultant/Program Manager support in assisting the Department during its implementation of the recommendations. This includes, but is not limited to, serving as a program manager, consultant, advisor, and facilitator. 
The estimated amount of this logical follow-on requirement is $650,000.00.
4.	The Authority and Supporting Rationale. 
Orders placed under GSA Federal Supply Schedules are exempt from the competition requirements in FAR Part 6.  However, an ordering activity must justify its action when restricting consideration of GSA Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than required in FAR 8.405-1 or 8.405-2.
The applicable authority permitting to limit sources for this follow-on procurement is in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C).  As cited in FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order or BPA must not have been previously issued under a sole-source or limited-sources procedures.   
The original Task Order was competitively awarded under the authority of FAR 8.401 Multiple-Award Schedule Program to Bronner against GSA Schedule GS-10F-0052N on June, 17 2011. The competition under the original Task Order was posted on GSA e-Buy to all GSA Schedule holders under SINs 874-1 Consulting Services.  Twenty (20) quotes were received and evaluated as technically acceptable thus, adequate competition was obtained.  Bronners quote was determined to be the best value to the Government.  This determination was based on Bronner being the vendor whose quote, in conforming to the Request for Quotation, provided the overall best value to the Government, technical and price considered.  Bronners quote met the Governments objective in obtaining the highest technical quality considered necessary to fulfill the Governments requirement within a realistic and reasonable price.  It resulted in the best overall technical approach considering Bronners management approach and technical capabilities, personnel qualifications, organizational experience, past performance and price to meet the Governments needs and with minimal to none performance risk to the Government.
Bronner provided support under Task Order  D11PD18884 with the Statement of Work entitled Examination, Evaluation and Recommendation Analysis of the Department of the Interior Indian Affairs & Indian Education Organization, for the Office of the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs (AS-IA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) from June 20, 2011 through March 9, 2012. The period of performance for Task Order D11PD18884 presumed that the government would no longer require contractor support. However, the need continues for this contractor to provide consultant services as a follow-on requirement. Through work on the original Task Order, Bronner has gained a unique insight and working knowledge of the OS-IA, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Indian Education. 
The Department of the Interior has a unique responsibility among Federal agencies to administer a broad array of programs and services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Under treaties signed by the United States of America, Tribal Nations are entitled to the services and resources administered by the Department through the Bureaus managed by the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs. 
President Barack Obama stated in his Tribal Consultation Memoranda dated November 5, 2009, History has shown that failure to include the voices of tribal officials in formulating policy affecting their communities has all too often led to undesirable and, at many times, devastating and tragic resultsConsultation is a critical ingredient of a sound and productive Federal-tribal relationship.
December 01, 2011 in response to Executive Order 13175Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, Secretarial Order (SO) 3317-- The Department of the Interior Policy on Consultation with Indian Tribes was issued by the Secretary of the Interior. SO 3317 states Consultation is a process that aims to create effective collaboration with Indian tribes and to inform Federal decision-makers. Consultation is built upon government-to-government exchange of information and promotes enhanced communication that emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. Communication will be open and transparent without compromising the rights of Indian tribes or the government-to-government consultation process.
The original Task Order final deliverable report establishes, on a functional basis, a series of recommended alternatives and next steps for the support services organization within Indian Affairs. In order for the Assistant Secretary  Indian Affairs to move forward in the implementation of these recommendations, Indian Tribal consolations are mandated. The logical follow-on will provide the government with technical, Subject Matter Expertise, and consultant services to assist the government in its efforts in moving the entire organization forward, having the benefit of lessons learned from the centralization and building on the urgency to continue with the current momentum for change in support of the Assistant Secretarys mission to improve coordination and services to BIA and BIE programs and the Indian Tribes.
5.	A Determination by the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer that the Order Represents the Best Value Consistent with 8.404(d).
The amount for the full Period of Performance of the follow-on award is estimated to be $650,000.00.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 8.404(d) GSA has already determined the price of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d).
The Firm-Fixed-Price for these deliverables will be based on hourly rates under Bronners GSA Schedule. At a minimum the price will be determined fair and reasonable via the use of price analysis based on the comparison to historical pricing of prior engagements of similar size and scope, and comparing the price to the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), and any other price analysis tools deemed necessary which will be documented in the Award Summary for this logical follow-on. Based on the price analysis, the anticipated price will represent the Best Value to the Government.
6.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted among Schedule Holders and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.
Market Research was not conducted because a new competition would be impracticable. This requirement is suited to a logical follow-on in accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) as awarding to another source is likely to result in a delay of Tribal Consultation process and disruption of the current state of which the final recommendations of a balanced approach for support services that is characterized by shared responsibility, improved service delivery, a new focus on BIAs and BIEs needs and coordinated communication is based upon. 
Through work on the original Task Order, Bronner has gained a unique insight and working knowledge of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Education, and the current state. Additionally, Bronners project team has an established rapport and trust with the Indian Affairs leadership given the urgency to build on the current momentum for change in support of the Assistant Secretarys of Indian Affairs mission to improve coordination and services to BIA and BIE programs and Tribes. Finally, Bronner will bring the necessary combination of expertise, relevant experience, tools and key personnel that makes Bronner distinctively and uniquely qualified to meeting the particular needs of this requirement.
Awarding to a Contractor other than Bronner would result in substantial duplication of effort thus increasing costs to the Government and causing unacceptable delays to moving forward with the Tribal Consultation Sessions. These costs would not expect to be recovered through competition. The Government is minimizing the risk for successful completion of this requirement by utilizing a logical follow-on to the original Task Order as it is in the best interest of the Government. 
7.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification.
None.
8.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers that Led to the Restricted Consideration Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services is Made.
None, no subsequent acquisitions are anticipated and all tasks are being provided for under this task order; if new tasks are identified, a new competitive procurement will be conducted to fulfill any future requirements.

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center San Diego (FLCSD) Contracting Office intends to award a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to Azima DLI, 300 Trade Center Drive, Woburn, ma 01801. This contract is for supplies (Engineering Vibration Analysis Equipment and Software update). The reason why the above-named source has been determined to be the only supplier who can furnish the requirement is the vendor/contractor has proprietary rights to the engineering, manufacturing, and method of production needed to supply to the specifications of the requiring activity.

Special Notice Synopsis:

The National Acquisition Center intends to enter into a sole-source contract with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the procurement of Lamotrigine (Lamictal) a branded medication indicated for the treatment of both adjunctive and monotherapy of partial seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and for generalization with no generic alternative. This action is to contract for the identified drug which is currently sourced from a non-designated Trades Agreement Act (TAA) country. Lamictal is a patented drug available only from one source, GSK, until its patent expires April 25, 2014. This contract is necessary as Lamotrigine (Lamictal) cannot be therapeutically substituted with other antiepileptic products. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals as Lamotrigine (Lamictal) is protected by patent until April 25, 2014 and only available from GSK. It is anticipated a contract will be awarded for a base and four one-year options. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to the email address stated herein, Attn: Youlanda.Duggar@va.gov. The Government anticipates an award date on or before May 30, 2012.

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Ca&ntilde;on City, Colorado<br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR<br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State.</p>
<p>The Bureau is organized into different offices, including, but not limited to the Office of Criminal Justice Assistance Partnerships (INL/CAP), the Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP), the Office of the Americas (INL/LP), the Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA), the Office of Iraq Programs (INL/I), and the Office of Africa and the Middle East (INL/AME).</p>
<p>INL focuses on holistic criminal justice reform, including training, mentoring, and capacity building in the justice, police, and corrections sectors. At present, INL funds and manages corrections programs in 22 different countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Mexico, Morocco, Brazil, Iraq, South Sudan, and Haiti.</p>
<p>The corrections programs target providing assistance to countries in developing the capacities to detain arrested persons appropriately and securely awaiting trial and sentencing, as well as those who have been sanctioned by a court properly in a manner consistent with commonly accepted human rights principles.</p>
<p>The program goals for each country vary according to the requirements and specific needs of that country and the strategic interests of the United States. For instance, a primary component of the corrections program in Pakistan is to give the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province the capacity to house high security-threat prisoners in a safe, secure, humane, and transparent manner. In particular, INL anticipates during the first year of performance the ICMTC will concentrate on training for Afghan and Pakistani corrections personnel.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The incumbent will serve as the Training Center Liaison Officer (hereinafter referred to as the Officer) to the International Correctional Management Training Center (ICMTC) in Colorado. ICMTC is a year-round, in-residence corrections training center operated at the former Colorado Women's Correctional Facility in Ca&ntilde;on City, Colorado.</p>
<p>This initiative represents a significant evolution in INL's method of delivery for foreign assistance training in corrections. The Officer will provide quality corrections training using courses and curricula developed and approved by INL/CAP and relevant INL program officers.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.603 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Request for Quote number for this procurement is FHF-12-Q-0324. This procurement is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The government anticipates awarding one Firm Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order as a result of this solicitation. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 511210 - Software Publishers. Size Standard $25.0 Million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STATEMENT OF WORK: The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Division of Housing, Mission and Goals (DHMG) has a need to develop simulation models that jointly encompass interest rates, inflation, house prices, and unemployment. These new models will be combined with existing behavioral models (e.g., prepayment and default models) to enable mortgage valuation and risk management capabilities. Some examples of the capabilities desired are the ability to test the sensitivity of guarantee fees to various assumptions, and the specification and computation of credit risk metrics. This development will support the Agency's mission to analyze and quantify the risks that its regulated entities engage in, and could potentially be shared in the future with other regulators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To support this goal, software is required that will enable the development of these models. The software needs to be flexible enough to accommodate the research agenda and potential future projects the Agency may consider. To facilitate these needs, the software, at a minimum, shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide a general mathematical programming environment that is exceptionally fast, providing performance comparable to compiled C or FORTRAN programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide optimization capability (both unconstrained and constrained optimization and maximum likelihood). For optimization, it is required that the software solve the Nonlinear Programming problem, subject to general constraints on the parameters - linear or nonlinear, equality or inequality, using the Sequential Quadratic Programming method in combination with several descent methods selectable by the user. For estimation using maximum likelihood, it is required that the software solves the general maximum likelihood problem subject to linear or nonlinear and equality or inequality parameter constraints.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide the following discrete choice models: Nested logit model, Conditional logit model, Multinomial logit model, Adjacent category multinomial logit model, Stereotype multinomial logit model, Poisson regression (left or right truncated, left or right censored, or zero-inflated models), Negative binomial regression (left or right truncated, left or right censored, or zero-inflated models), Logit and probit models, Ordered logit and probit models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide financial time series analysis capability, including the following univariate GARCH models (ARCH, GARCH, IGARCH, FIGARCH, and EGARCH).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide multivariate models at least including capability to estimate models characterized by conditional constant correlation, dynamic conditional correlation, FI dynamic conditional correlation, and exponential (Exp) dynamic conditional correlation. This is an especially important requirement to address the correlation assumptions in the simulation model development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull; The software is required to provide multivariate time series capabilities, including: Least Squares Dummy Variable model for multivariate data with bias correction of the parameters, Hamilton's Regime-Switching Regression model, Seasonal VARMAX model: SVARMAX(p,d,q,P,D,Q)s, and also Time Series Cross-Sectional Regression models. This extensive multivariate capability is an important requirement.<br />. <br />Refer to Attachment 1 for a description of the products (brand name or equal) and quantities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The purchase order will be for a one-year base and four one-year options.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SCHEDULE: Offerors should complete Attachment 1 and return it with the quote. The offeror shall provide the unit price for EACH item as well as the extended price for the Period of Performance identified above.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCHEDULE OF ITEMS<br /><br /></span>***Please provide quotes based on attachment labeled "Schedule of Items."</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />GENERAL CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PERFORMANCE BASED SERVICE CONTRACT</span></strong></p>
<p>This work is being solicited as Performance Based, Commercial Item contract. Performance Based means the Contractor is responsible for an end product. If an end product is not provided, an adjustment to the payment will be made. A Commercial Item contract streamlines the terms and conditions to resemble those already used in the everyday marketplace.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BASIS OF AWARD</strong></span></p>
<p>One award will be made. Offer of award will be made to the Quoter(s) whose quote, as determined by the Contracting Officer, provides the best value to the Government, considering but not limited to such factors as price, Contractor's experience with this type of work and past performance to accomplish this type of work. The Experience Questionnaire will be used as part of the evaluation and is found as an attachment to the combined solicitation/synopsis.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall institute a complete Quality Control Plan (QCP) to ensure the requirements of this contract are provided as specified. The goal of the QCP should be to identify and correct any problems that may arise before they are identified by the CO or his/her representative. A written Quality Control Plan must be submitted to the Government prior to commencement of work and will be incorporated into the resultant contract.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SCOPE OF CONTRACT</strong></span></p>
<p>It is the purpose of this contract to secure services for wrapping Government-furnished tree seedlings. The Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, supplies (except those designated as Government-furnished) and incidentals to perform all work necessary to wrap trees at the location specified.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WRAPPING LOCATION </strong></span></p>
<p>The tree wrapping facility is located at the Hungry Horse Ranger District at the Administration Site, Hungry Horse, Montana.</p>
<p>Facilities to be used in the prosecution of the work are the Forest Service tree wrapping storage and compound area. The tree seedlings shall be wrapped at the tree wrapping compound and stored in the tree cooler or as otherwise directed by the Contracting Officers Representative, (COR).</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SITE VISIT (FAR 52.237-1) (APRIL 1984)</strong></span></p>
<p>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.</p>
<p>Interested parties desiring to inspect the work area are asked to make an appointment with Paul Jorgenson at the Hungry Horse Ranger Station, telephone (406) 758-3535.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY</strong></span></p>
<p>The Government will furnish the following:</p>
<p>Gate keys - to be signed out and returned upon completion of contract<br />Lights, water, washtubs and cans<br />Terra-Sorb<br />Sontara wrap (similar to Kimtex) in rolls, scissors, nails, ribbon and root pruning shears<br />Vegetable oil for dipping shears<br />Tree seedlings<br />Plastic tubs, baskets or boxes for wrapped trees (hereafter called tub)<br />Use of the cold storage buildings and wrapping sheds <br />Flagging or wood stakes to be labeled with seed lot identification<br />Permanent ink markers<br />Toilet facilities <br />Hoses and nozzles</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be liable for all loss or damage of such delivered Government-furnished property until completion and final acceptance of the work required under this Contract.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CONTRACT TIME</strong></span></p>
<p>The need for tree wrapping services may not be continuous. There may be periods of high activity around the dates that various planting units open. Likewise, there may be periods of inactivity when planting units have not opened, the number of wrapped trees exceeds the 3-day planting needs, or weather and ground conditions have closed the tree planting sites, etc. These periods of inactivity, which may be of several days duration, are considered normal to this type of work. The Contractor is expected to suspend operations during these periods of inactivity and to begin again promptly when additional trees are needed to be wrapped.</p>
<p>Item<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Description Estimated</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span></p>
<p>1.1-1.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract Period&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May 01, 2012 - July 25, 2012</p>
<p>When weather and ground conditions are favorable for planting and tree survival, the Notice to proceed with the work will be issued. The effective date of the Notice to Proceed will be a few days before the tree planting begins. Because proper planting conditions prevail for a limited length of time, it is imperative that the Contractor begin work promptly once conditions are favorable and be able to respond to a varied number of requested trees to be wrapped.</p>
<p>For this Contract, all wrapping will be done at Hungry Horse Ranger Station. The Contractor shall generally be required to wrap trees from designated nursery lots at a rate of 7,000 to 30,000 trees per day.

<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DELIVERY OF TREE SEEDLINGS</strong></span></p>

The Government may also take the following actions:</p>
<p>a. Presentation of a Contract Discrepancy Report requiring a written explanation for substandard performance.<br />b. Payment deductions in accordance with the PRS.<br />c.

<p>This acquisition is being procured using Total Small Business Set Aside.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Energy and Environment Division, requires a custom gas chromatograph to measure the composition of low GWP refrigerants that are being tested in the Novel Working Fluids for High-Efficiency HVAC&amp;R Equipment project. The Gas Chromatograph will be used to measure the composition of mixed refrigerants. Refrigerant samples will be taken from our test apparatus to the GC for composition measurement. Samples are taken by trapping 100% liquid between two valves and then expand all of the liquid to 100% vapor into a 0.5 L sample bottle. For most refrigerants, the expanded vapor pressure will be around 10 psi. The GC should not be refrigerant dependent; we should be able to use it to measure the composition of most refrigerant mixtures. The GC should be ready to measure the composition of a mixture of 40 % mass R134a (102.03 g/mol, CAS Number : 811-97-2) and 60 % mass R1234yf (114.04 g/mol CAS Number :754-12-1) with no other equipment and/or option and/or column purchases required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VOLUME 2: TECHNICAL FACTORS:</p>
<p>1. Availability of Quality Controlled Antibodies: (40 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon the availability of the offeror to access the proteins of interest.</p>
<p>2. Technical Approach (30 Points):</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's response based upon how clearly the offeror's response addresses and describes the offeror's ability to complete/perform the work described in the Statement of Work (SOW) in enough detail that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject would be able to understand the offeror's ability to perform the work.</p>
<p><br />3. Format of Interpretability of Results: (20 Points):</p>

<p>The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. The lack of a performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The past performance subfactors are listed below in order of relative importance. These subfactors will be used to evaluate the quality of past performance.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Subfactors:<br />&bull; Record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship<br />&bull; Adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance<br />&bull; Reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction<br />&bull; Business-like concern for the interest of the customer</p>

There are approximately 25 reviewers at each meeting and each reviewer receives a copy of the applications. Once the meeting is completed the application copies need to be destroyed.<br /><br />The destruction of the applications as well as any other paper generated from the meeting results in several hundred pounds of shredding per week.<br />The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, equipment and materials to provide bi-weekly shredding services for fifteen rooms at 6701 Rockledge Drive, Rockledge Two Building, Bethesda, MD 20817. The fifteen rooms to have bins picked up are: Rooms 2040; 2189; 2197; 3217; 3159; 4030; 4129; 4133; 4193; 4197; 5133; 5129; 5193; 5197; and 6191. The Contractor shall empty all shredding bins, boxes and mail carts preferably Tuesday and Friday. The materials shall be shred either on-site or off-site at the Contractor's facility. CSR requires a signed "Certificate of Destruction" which will include the date, weight, and bin count of the materials destroyed. This certificate shall be emailed to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), TBD at time of award, within 24 hours of the completion of the shredding of the materials.<br /><br />The period of performance will be a one (1) year base with four (4) one-year options. Award is anticipated to be May 1, 2012.<br /><br />Additional Information:<br /><br />1. How many bins and mail carts per room? 3 bins per room.

<p>IX. FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, is applicable to this requirement. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following evaluation criteria: A) Technical Capability; B) Past Performance and C) Price.</p>
<p>Past Performance will not be evaluated on quotations that are determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Price shall not be evaluated on proposals that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Evaluation factors.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability: The offeror shall demonstrate successful performance of at least two (2) projects, in the past three (3) years similar to this requirement.</p>
<p>B. Past Performance: Past Performance: The offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.<br /><br />The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance. <br /><br />The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>C) Price: An evaluation of the offeror's price proposal will be made to determine if proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical proposal. Reasonableness determinations will be made by determining if competition exists, by comparing proposed prices with established commercial or GSA price schedules (if applicable), and/or by comparing proposed prices with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).</p>
<p>Evaluation of Options: In accordance with FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

However, the contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless the loss or damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault or negligence of the contractor.

The contractor shall cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and all liability insurance policies, However, at the discretion of the Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Programs are also characterized by large obligations of USG funds, a potentially high-risk security environment, a geographically broad operating platform, demanding program schedules, frequently changing requirements, politically sensitive outcomes, multiple interagency and international actors, multiple contractor and sub-contractor relationships, and intense audit/oversight scrutiny. Detailed plans, goals, objectives, and evaluation criteria are required for the long-range implementation and administration of the programs. Decisions concerning planning and organizing the programs are complicated by the intricacy of the contracts and the need to deal with multilayered concepts. Problems can arise that require intuition - the ability to tell when something is wrong or is likely to go wrong; inductive reasoning - the ability to combine pieces of information to form general rules or conclusions (includes finding a relationship among seemingly unrelated events); and deductive reasoning - the ability to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense.</p>
<p>F. PHYSICAL DEMANDS<br />The work requires the ability to travel to and from several remote areas. The work requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Successful completion of a State Department Class 1 unrestricted medical exam is required. Extended assignments to remote program sites will be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Climate conditions are also a factor. Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the work difficult and may not be capable of passing the State Department required medical exam.</p>
<p>G. SUPERVISORY CONTROLS <br />The COR carries out duties on behalf of the CO but reports to the INL Director at Post. The GTM is delegated authority by the CO to assist the COR. The incumbent's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of demonstrated professional judgment, results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations.</p>
<p>H. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE.<br />The period of performance will be one year from the date of award with four option years.</p>
<p>III. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />A. U.S. citizen, holding at least an actual or interim State Department Top Secret security clearance.</p>
<p>B. A Bachelor's Degree in architecture, construction science, construction management, or engineering; preferably structural or civil engineering preferred. Master's degree is preferred.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>

BACKGROUND. <br />The mission of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is to minimize the impact of international crime and illegal drugs on the United States and its citizens through providing effective foreign assistance and fostering global cooperation. INL is responsible for developing policies and managing programs to strengthen law enforcement and other rule of law institutional capabilities outside the United States. INL relies on contractors to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. Because these programs require resources well beyond those organic to INL, INL has three indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under which it provides the services of experienced law enforcement, judicial, corrections and counternarcotics advisors to provide support to host nation civilian law enforcement and rule of law programs overseas; provide pre-deployment and in-country support for advisors; and perform other related functions.</p>
<p>INL currently administers about fourteen task orders issued under its IDIQ contracts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, the West Bank, Haiti, Sudan, Lebanon and Liberia. The task orders range in value from $10M to approximately $1B. The task orders include both fixed labor rate and cost reimbursement contract line items (CLINs).</p>
<p>B. ORGANIZATION. <br />The IDIQ contracts are administered by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) contracting officer (CO) in Rosslyn, VA. Organizationally, the CO for these contracts resides within the DOS Office of Acquisitions Management (A/LM/AQM).The CO designates a contracting officer's representative (COR) and government technical monitors (GTM) from INL to deploy overseas to the location of contractor performance and serve as the "eyes and ears" of the CO. The COR reports contract issues directly to the CO. The GTM assists the COR. All personnel deployed on INL missions are assigned to and report operationally and administratively to the INL Director at post. The programs at post are supported by INL Headquarters in Washington, DC. Of note, Program Offices support respective field operations in various regions of the globe in terms of program policy, budget formulation, strategic guidance and monitoring and evaluation. The Program Offices are: <br />&bull; The Office of Iraq Programs (INL/I); <br />&bull; The Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP); <br />&bull; The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP); <br />&bull; The Office of Europe and Asia Programs (INL/EA); and <br />&bull; The Office of Africa and Middle East Programs (INL/AME.) <br />Within INL's Office of Resource Management (INL/RM), the Contract Administrative Support Division (INL/RM/CAS), maintains liaison and coordination with contract oversight personnel by providing guidance on contract administrative policies, procedures, training and other support. CAS functions are carried out in strict coordination with the Acquisitions and Grants Support division (INL/RM/AGS.)</p>

When we send an alert it will go out on up to 3 phone numbers (as both voice and sms), up to 2 email addresses, and, for a small percentage of the command, possible fax notification per recipient. This equates to up to 15,000 telephone messages, 15,000 text messages, 10,000 emails and 20 faxes per alert.  The total requested is up to 375,000 telephone messages per year, 375,000 text messages per year, 250,000 emails per year, and 500 faxes per year. This emergency notification system must provide a web-based application service in addition to being able to deliver secure, time-sensitive messages to decision-makers instantly via message delivery via landline phone, mobile phone, fax, email, SMS, pager, TTY, Blackberry, PDA and other wireless devices.  This system will be able to automatically bridge to a conference call for emergency team collaboration. This requires 1500 minutes per year for conference calls for 20 people per call. It will use priority calling and be able to initiate real-time tracking of messages and web-based reporting for up-to-date information. It must rely on off-site, redundant data, calling and support centers for a truly virtual emergency notification system. The vendor must provide customers with a designated implementation specialist to assist in the implementation process, and provides training for the system  for the first year as part of the license fee. It will have the ability for contacts to create their own profile through a web-based registration page that allows recipients to modify their own contact information. The system will provide customer with sub-administrative roles that allow them the ability to import, update or delete certain contacts in a database using a CSV file while tracking the import history.

The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability.</p>

<DESC><p>This acquisition is being issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 12. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with the additional information included in this notice. The Request for Quote number is HSCG23-12-Q-AFR217. This is a sole-source acquisition to be awarded to Tognum America. This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-57 (March 15, 2012). It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The NAICS code is 336312.</p>
<p>This synopsis/solicitation is for the requirements detailed in the following Statement of Work:</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)<br />DATED: MARCH 6, 2012</p>
<p>1.0 GENERAL.</p>
<p>1.1 SCOPE. <br />The Government has a requirement for a sole source task order for Main Propulsion auxiliary support equipment from MTU/DaimlerChrysler. In preparation to meet the training requirements to support the new USCG Fast Response Cutter (FRC), the United States Coast Guard (USCG) desires to purchase an auxiliary support equipment to run the previously procured training version of the MTU Main Diesel Engine (MDE), and the propulsion control system as installed on the FRC. These auxiliary equipments will be used in the training that directly supports maintenance and operations of the installed main diesel engines and on Coast Guard WPC class cutters. The training aid and components will be delivered to USCG Training Center (TRACEN) Yorktown, VA.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND. <br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a military, multi-mission, maritime service within the Department of Homeland Security and one of the nation's five armed services. Its core roles are to protect the public, the environment, and U.S. economic and security interests in any maritime region in which those interests may be at risk, including international waters and America's coasts, ports, and inland waterways.</p>
<p>The USCG has made a conscious effort within the last few years to determine the most appropriate, cost effective solutions to workforce performance problems, while simultaneously optimizing the current training infrastructure to meet operational and logistical demands. The USCG currently relies heavily on contracted training for the maintenance, operation, and troubleshooting for the MTU components on the WPC class cutter. The USCG training program management office (FC-512) has worked to garner the resources necessary to lessen the reliance on contracted training. The USCG has determined that TRACEN Yorktown's Engineering and Weapons (T-ew) facility will be the future site to train maintainers and operators of this equipment. A significant T-ew facilities renovation is planned to start in the next 12 months including the construction of a new building intended to house the WPC/FRC training aids, laboratories, and classrooms to create a Land-Based Training Facility (LBTF). This auxiliary support equipment procured by this task order shall be stored at the LBTF.</p>

<DESC><br />---AMENDMENT 01 DATED 30 MAR 2012---<br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is amended to replace the original draft Statement of Work with a&nbsp;revised draft Statement of Work.&nbsp; All other terms and conditions&nbsp;remain the same.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Capable sources are sought for a service requirement entitled "Protected Repository for the Defense against Infrastructure Cyber Threat (PREDICT) Coordination Center (PCC)". The PCC manages the PREDICT data catalog and operations, processes researchers' applications for PREDICT data, and handles administrative matters. The PCC facilitates the release of datasets by data hosts to approved researchers. In support of these activities, the PCC develops, hosts and maintains a web portal that advertises the datasets available from the PREDICT program and automates the generation of appropriate agreements for and between PREDICT entities. The primary agreements administered by the PCC are (1) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the PCC and Researcher, (2) MOA between the PCC and Data Host, and (3) Data Use Agreement between the Data Provider and the Researcher. The contractor will be responsible for providing all labor, material, and equipment necessary to perform the PCC services.<br /><br />This requirement will support the Department of Homeland Security. The attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) provides additional information. Interested parties are encouraged to review https://www.predict.org.<br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is 01 Oct 2012 through 30 Sep 2013 plus 4 option years. If all options are exercised, performance would conclude 30 Sep 2017.<br /><br />The anticipated NAICS code is 541519 with an associated small business size standard of $25M average annual receipts over the last 3 years.<br /><br />Note that this Sources Sought Notice is for planning purposes only. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used to inform an acquisition strategy and future solicitation, particularly the appropriateness of a set aside for 8(a), HUBZone Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), or Small Business (SB). If adequate responses are not received, the acquisition may be solicited on a "full and open" basis.<br /><br />If this effort is to be set aside, then a clause such as FAR 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" would apply and at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel would have to be expended for employees of the prime contractor.<br /><br />All interested small businesses (of any classification listed above) are invited to respond. In order to be considered, responses must be organized as follows:<br /><br />1. Positive statement of intent to submit a proposal for this solicitation as a prime contractor, should a solicitation be issued. Include a description of how the 50% requirement of a clause such as FAR 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting" would be met. Describe how anticipated subcontractors, if any, would be selected and which functions they would be responsible for.<br /><br />2. Capability &amp; Experience package consisting of items (a) - (c). The Technical Requirements and Deliverables referenced below are in the draft Statement of Work (SOW) posted with this notice.<br /><br />(a) Capability &amp; Experience Matrix. Using the attached spreadsheet, provide references (such as paragraph number) to the location in the Capability &amp; Experience Statement where each Technical Requirement and Deliverable is addressed.

In support of these activities, the PCC develops, hosts and maintains a web portal that advertises the datasets available from the PREDICT program and automates the generation of appropriate agreements for and between PREDICT entities. The primary agreements administered by the PCC are (1) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the PCC and Researcher, (2) MOA between the PCC and Data Host, and (3) Data Use Agreement between the Data Provider and the Researcher. The contractor will be responsible for providing all labor, material, and equipment necessary to perform the PCC services.<br /><br />This requirement will support the Department of Homeland Security. The attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) provides additional information.

<p>TACTICAL AIR CONTROL PARTY (TACP) CLOSE AIR SUPPORT SYSTEM (CASS) SOFTWARE VERSION 1.4.5 DEVELOPMENT AND INTERIM CONTRACTOR SUPPORT<br />1. Introduction<br />The U.S. Air Force's Electronics Systems Center (ESC) is requesting information from responsible sources with experience in complex software engineering and tactical battlefield communications to develop and support TACP CASS Software Version 1.4.5. The development effort will include all system and software engineering and testing to field this next generation of CASS software on multiple platforms (e.g., mounted, dismounted) within the TACP environment. Interim Contractor Support (ICS) will be required once the new software version (Version 1.4.5) is fielded.<br />The current fielded CASS Software is Version 1.4.2. CASS Software Version 1.4.4 is under development by Rockwell Collins, Poway, CA, and will be fielded starting in October 2012, with ICS for Version 1.4.4 expected to be provided by Rockwell Collins through September 2015. <br />NOTE: This RFI is for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). Its issuance does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information properly marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this RFI, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any information.<br />2. Objectives<br />The Government is seeking new software capability with or without incorporation of the existing source code to fulfill the following objectives related to the next generation of CASS software (Version 1.4.5): <br />a. Support generation of Air Support Requests (ASRs) including transmitting ASRs to higher-echelon TACPs via the USAF Satcom Joint Air Request Network (JARN).<br />b. Provide support for both pre-planned and immediate Close Air Support (CAS).<br />c. Provide communication software (MIL-STD protocols) required for Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) 9-Line communication/coordination with strike aircraft. <br />d. Translate between Variable Message Format VMF) (K-series messages) and Link-16 (J-series messages) for communication with strike aircraft.<br />e. Ensure the software is configurable for execution on different hardware platforms located at (1) Army echelons, (2) on mobile vehicles, and (3) dismounted. <br />f.

<p>The agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from only Zodiac Data Systems INC., which possesses unique capabilities demonstrated as follows: The 580th SMXS currently owns and uses HEIM GSSr Data recorders in the 580th SMXS EISE lab environment in building 229E. Currently we have the GSSr recorders installed on the following Operational Flight Program Aircraft Simulators; MC130H, AC130U, AC130H and HH60 Pave Hawk. This action will provide similar recording capabilities for the MC130E platform that will be compatible with the equipment we already have. The only source of these recorders is Zodiac Data Systems, INC.<br />Station drawings would have to be updated and maintained separately, configurations and connections would be different and would be problematic for troubleshooting or hot swapping equipment in case of failures. <br />Additionally, the HEIM d200f in this action is an Airborne Data Recorder that will be used along with currently owned D200f assets. The 580th SMXS currently owns two HEIM D200f Airborne Data Recorders that we use for DT&amp;E software testing. The compatibility with already owned equipment is the focus of the decision to purchase the D200f. The recorder is also modular and the modules are shared between recorders as needed.</p>
<p>DELIVERY - Place of delivery: 580 SMXS/Flight H, Building 229, Robins AFB, GA 31098<br />Purchase Description will be available when RFQ is posted. <br />The approximate RFQ issue date will be&nbsp;28 February&nbsp;2012; proposals are due&nbsp;30 Mar 2012. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation at www.fedbizopps.gov only. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED and no hard copies will be mailed out.<br />Offerors shall prepare their proposals in accordance with mandatory, explicit, and detailed instructions contained in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate past performance utilizing the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). Proposals will be evaluated and award made in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFQ. OFFERORS ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW RATINGS IN PPIRS FOR ACCURACY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.<br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.<br />All questions regarding the RFQ must be submitted in writing to James.Kaari@robins.af.mil. NO TELEPHONE QUESTIONS. All questions and answers will be uploaded to www.fedbizopps.gov . However, the identity of the potential offeror will not be included.

<a href="mailto:darlene.rideout@us.army.mil">ACC-APG SCRT - Natick (SPS)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division in support of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC), Natick, MA, is requesting Concept Papers from firms for battalion scale Waste to Energy Converter (WEC) systems for contingency base camps. This is not a Request for Proposal. The Government anticipates awarding multiple two-phase contracts, with competitive downselect after the first phase, under topic A.1 Combat Feeding Equipment Systems - Combat Food Service Equipment for Individual and Group Feeding, Sub-Topic h., of the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13.<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>Deployed forces generate enormous amounts of solid waste, including 3-4 lbs per person each day from field feeding, that has typically been disposed by burning in open burn pits, burn boxes, or trucked to landfills. These methods consume fuel and have negative environmental and force protection consequences. Burning waste creates operational and maintenance burdens, operational security concerns, safety and health issues, is environmentally harmful, and wastes energy. Backhauling waste is expensive, places Warfighters in harm's way, and also consumes fuel. However, for any military camp, the majority of the solid waste steam is carbonaceous and therefore could be remediated onsite and/or converted into an energy source. Effective waste destruction is of higher priority than efficient energy conversion, as is minimal manpower, but exporting energy improves the return on investment and shortens the payback period. <br><br>Waste characterization varies significantly, but projections can be made from the data in the referenced documents. Because much of the waste is generated by foodservice operations, it can be expected to contain substantial moisture from prepared food and partially consumed beverages, and it is not practical to manually segregate these materials. Bags of trash are also likely to contain small metal cans (e.g., from beverages and single serving fruit cups) and some glass bottles. Manual segregation is highly undesirable and should be limited to bulk food slop and obvious metal items, such as bags of empty #10 cans.<br><br>Previous work has shown small air-blown gasifier and pyrolysis technologies to have good potential for small-scale waste to energy conversion, although this RFI is not restricted to those technologies. However, existing prototypes have been unable to meet contingency basing needs in terms of transportability, ability to reliably handle raw unsegregated field waste, and/or other performance requirements expressed below. These shortfalls in current technology represent opportunities for applied research to address the requirements described in this synopsis.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS<br><br>For the purposes of this synopsis, the desired system characteristics are described in the following preliminary performance requirements:<br><br>     1. Complete System. The WEC shall include all necessary equipment (e.g., pre-processing, material transport, power generation, pollution control, etc.) to ingest bagged waste and export electrical power. It shall be rugged and low-maintenance to minimize operational costs, and shall have few consumables to minimize logistical requirements. <br>     2. Throughput. The WEC shall process 2 tons waste per day to support a battalion-scale expeditionary camp.<br>     3. Waste Feedstock. The WEC shall process unsorted mixed non-hazardous solid waste from foodservice and other activities, with variable constituents and moisture content as described in the background section. It is also desirable to process other waste materials such as wood pallets and used motor oil. <br>     4. Transportability. The entire WEC system shall be packaged or containerized in 8 8 20-foot ISO shipping containers for rapid deployment and compatibility with existing transportation assets. The WEC shall be packaged in as few containers as possible (objective 3 containers or fewer including power generation). The system should be capable of achieving CSC certification and passing rail impact and rough terrain transportation tests. <br>     5. Manpower. The WEC shall have automated control and operation and shall require minimal manpower (objective 1 part time operator), including any waste handling or segregation.<br>     6. Residues and Emissions. The WEC shall produce only non-hazardous residuals (e.g., no solid, liquid, or gaseous byproducts that require special handling or disposal). Any residues or emissions shall be benign to the environment and safe for equipment operators.<br>     7. Smoke and Odors. Because it is intended for use in the camp near trash generation and/or electrical power demands, the WEC shall produce no smoke or objectionable odors during operation, including startup, shutdown, and unexpected power interruptions.<br>     8. Power Generation. The WEC shall include its own power generation capability. The use of standard military tactical quiet generators may be advantageous from a maintenance perspective, but is not required. <br>     9. Fuel. The WEC shall be able to use either JP-8 or DF-2, whichever is available, for any fuel requirements (e.g., startup, operation, or bi-fuel power generation).<br>     10. Efficiency. In terms of fuel and electric power, the WEC shall be self-sufficient, exporting at least as much energy as it consumes.<br>     11. Cost. The WEC target production cost is less than $1M.<br><br>INFORMATION OF INTEREST<br><br>The intent of this synopsis is to identify systems/technologies that have already been shown to meet many of the performance requirements listed above and can be developed into a mature technology demonstration prototype system within two years, ready for demonstration/validation and subsequent engineering and manufacturing development. The Concept Paper should include physical and functional descriptions of the proposed system, including:<br><br>     1. Performance Requirements. Discuss ability to meet the requirements specified above.<br>     2. Technology. Discuss technology used, including reactor design and subsystems, and assess Technology Readiness Level / maturity.<br>     3. Cost. Estimate research and development funding required and production pricing.<br>     4. Packaging. Discuss system size and weight when configured for transportation as well as setup procedures and operational configuration.<br>     5. Feedstock. Discuss acceptable and problematic feedstock and any manual segregation or separation requirements. Discuss how the system assures automatic, reliable, and uninterrupted processing of challenging feedstock (e.g., variable composition, high moisture content, and containing tramp materials).<br>     6. Throughput. Discuss waste processing rates, acceptable duty cycles, and turndown capability to accommodate feedstock availability or power demand.<br>     7. Power. Discuss generator (e.g., type, output, efficiency), system parasitic energy requirements, and net electrical output.<br>     8. Consumables. Discuss all system consumables, including fuel, water, and maintenance items.<br><br>It is anticipated that offerors may have already built and demonstrated systems similar to what is sought by this synopsis. The Concept Paper may include as an appendix or attachment, not subject to the 5-page limit, additional information about existing systems such as descriptions, diagrams, photographs, energy balance, test data, and environmental certifications that help substantiate performance claims and demonstrate technology maturity.<br><br>SUBMISSION PROCESS<br><br>All interested firms are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper to NSRDEC in accordance with NSRDEC Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-13, which can be found at https://www3.natick.army.mil/nsrdecbaa.html. The BAA contains instructions for submission of Concept Papers. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside the U.S. Government. Nothing shall be construed herein or through the synopsis process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this synopsis. Firms responding to this synopsis shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government, and will not be returned to the submitter.

This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper.

Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2013.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2013. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Game Changing Opportunities inTechnology Development  2012 originally posted on December 12, 2011. This announcementis for the solicitation of proposals for the second appendix (Appendix B) to NRANNL12A3001N, entitled Technology Development for Solar Array Systems in Support ofElectric Propulsion. Offerors are advised that Appendix B will include two acquisition phases, and willinvolve a competitive selection process. Phase I will be for the design, analyses andtesting to mature a &gt;30 kW Solar Array System (SAS) concept to technology readinesslevel (TRL) 5, and to identify the most critical technological risks of extending theirconcept to the 300-450 kW level.  Additional technologies enabling the reliable,long-term operational capability of the system include the Power Management andDistribution (PMAD) system (including gimbals, slip ring, shunt regulator, andharnesses/connectors), high voltage, e.g., 160-300V,  high efficiency solar cells, solararray specific power greater than 150 W/kg (Goal of 200 W/kg), solar array stowed powerof 40kW/m3 or greater, and a reliable structural deployment system. Phase II will be forthe development of a SAS for in-space (relevant environment) demonstration as an attachedexternal experiment to the ISS, or as part of an experiment conducted on a free-flyervehicle. The intent of Phase II is to raise the TRL of an advanced, modular andextendable solar array system to TRL = 6 such that it may be subsequently infused into afollow-on Solar Electric Propulsion demonstration, as well as infusion into most otherspace applications requiring high power. The competition for Phase II will build on theresults of Phase I, therefore the award criteria for Phase II will include demonstratedcompletion of specified Phase I requirements.  The Government anticipates that only the Phase I contractors will be capable ofsuccessfully competing for Phase II. Proposals for Phase II will be requested from PhaseI contractors only. The Government does not intend to issue a new, formal solicitationfor Phase II.  The mechanism for providing pertinent Phase II proposal information willbe described in Appendix B when issued. Phase II of the acquisition will be synopsized inaccordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203.  Notwithstanding the expectation that only the PhaseI contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase II, proposals from allresponsible sources submitted by the specified due date will be considered. In order tocontend for Phase II awards, however, such prospective offerors must demonstrate atechnology readiness level equivalent to that of the Phase I contractors. Failure tofully and completely demonstrate the appropriate technology readiness level may renderthe proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award.The anticipated release date of Appendix B is on or about April 12, 2012. Specificdetails of the NRA Appendix B, including proposal due dates, will be accessible via theNASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES)(http://nspires.nasaprs.com), under Open Solicitations for NRA NNL12A3001N. All other information included in the original posting remains unchanged.

<p>4. The Government anticipates award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the LOWEST PRICE DEEMED TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE to the Government. If two or more quotes are equal in all respects, the government will choose a winner in accordance with FAR Part 14.408-6.</p>
<p>5. This pre-solicitation/synopsis notice includes the following attachments:</p>
<p>Attachment 1. DRAFT Statement of Work, Enterprise Strategic Hardware Operations Procurement (ESHOP), 26 March 2012</p>
<p>Attachment 2. DRAFT NGA IT Hardware Requirements List (NIHRL), 26 March 2012</p>
<p>Attachment 3. DRAFT ESHOP Evaluation Criteria, 26 March 2012</p>
<p>Attachment 4. ESHOP Bidders List, 26 March 2012</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to review all attachments and provide answers to the following questions no later than Wednesday, April 18, 2012 at 3:30 PM Eastern Time to Adam Greenspan (adam.m.greenspan@nga.mil): <br /><br />A. Reference the Draft NGA IT Hardware Requirements List (NIHRL):</p>
<p>a. Would you be able to propose an item price for each item? If not, what additional specification information would be required?<br />b. Is the "brand name or equal" requirement clear?<br />c. Do you note any equipment that is at end of service life?<br /><strong>d. Can you confirm that the salient characteristics provided for each item would allow your firm to propose products that are equivalent to the brand name item specified in the Draft NIHRL? If not, please recommend salient characteristics that would allow your firm to propose an equivalent item.<br />e. In cases where you judge that an "or equal" IT hardware item does not exist based on the salient characteristics provided in the Draft NIHRL, please provide the technical rationale that justifies only the brand name product for that particular item.<br /><br /></strong>B. Reference the Draft Statement of Work (SOW):</p>
<p>a. Are the requirements clear?<br />b. Are the delivery times realistic?<br />c. Other comments?</p>
<p>C. General comments about the ESHOP acquisition</p>
<p>6. All contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (http://www.ccr.gov) database as well as ORCA (www.orca.gov) prior to any contract award. Lack of registration in CCR and ORCA will make an offeror ineligible for award. Please submit the following information with submission in response to this Draft RFP: Cage code, DUNS number, the date offer expires, line item unit price, and total cost.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this requirement will be competed solely through the Government Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov). However, the anticipated official solicitation issuance date is unknown. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) makes no representation that a Final RFP will be issued or that a contract award will result from the solicitation if and when one is issued.</p>

<DESC><strong>TITLE:  NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center Protected Species Branch Turtle Tagging and Satellite Tag Data Collection</strong>
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting proposals, on behalf of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Protected Species Branch (PSB) for contractor support of turtle tagging and satellite tag data collection.  A comprehensive research program to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in US waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean has been established as an inter-agency agreement (IA) between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries Service).  The research program is called Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS).   The goal of AMAPPS is to coordinate the data collection and analysis efforts of the NOAA Fisheries Service Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Migratory Birds to accomplish six primary objectives: 1) Collect broad-scale data over multiple years on the seasonal distribution and abundance of marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds), sea turtles, and sea birds using direct aerial and shipboard surveys of coastal US Atlantic Ocean waters; 2) Collect similar data at finer scales at several (approcximately 3) sites of particular interest to NOAA partners using visual and acoustic survey techniques; 3) Conduct telemetry studies of sea turtles, pinnipeds and seabirds to develop corrections for availability bias in the abundance estimate and to collect additional data on habitat use and life-history, residence time, and frequency of use; 4) Explore alternative platforms and technologies to improve population assessment studies; 5) Assess the population size of surveyed species at regional scales; and 6) Develop models and associated tools to translate these survey data into seasonal, spatially-explicit density estimates incorporating habitat characteristics.  PSB has a requirement for data from satellite tags on 20 juvenile and adult loggerhead sea turtles in the southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, ideally off of Virginia and northern North Carolina.  Additionally, the requirement includes additional work to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data, and 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong><br />As a part of this the AMAPPS initiative, NEFSC PSB seeks to obtain information from at least 20 satellite tags on loggerhead sea turtles captured (via dipnet or other appropriate means) in near shore or inshore Mid-Atlantic waters.  NEFSC also seeks to improve the estimation of availability bias for loggerhead sea turtles in Mid-Atlantic waters.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />In support of the operation of tagging the loggerhead sea turtles and tracking via satellite tag data, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to perform the following services:  <br />1. Provide a seaworthy vessel for capturing and sampling loggerheads in offshore waters in Virginia and Northern North Carolina.<br />2. Supply all necessary gear to sight, capture, tag, and sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.<br />3. Have minimum of four (4) qualified contractor vessel crew personnel available to sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.<br />4. Produce a final report which includes the methods used for capture, handling, and sampling; the data collected; a discussion on any unusual or unexpected events, as well as a list of recommendations for improving similar projects in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government may exercise optional items for the following work:<br />1. Deploy twenty (20) model turtles in turbid areas which includes the Chesapeake Bay and in clearer areas which includes the Mid-Atlantic offshore at various depths and various angles.   Repeatedly fly over the models with a survey plane and conduct the detection trials in accordance with AMAPPS observing protocols.<br />2. Estimate availability bias.<br />3. Conduct experimental detection trials and analyze data to determine the depth at which turtles were available to be seen and its relationship to turbidity levels</p>
<p>A Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about March 30, 2012 through the Government-wide point of entry website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The due date for proposals is May 3, 2012.  The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing the procedures identified in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors, 1-4, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 5. Price; Factors: 1. Experience; 2. Sampling Plan; 3. Corporate Resources (e.g. vessels, planes, and supplies); 4. Past Performance; 5. Price.  Each potential offeror is responsible for checking this website to gain all the updates or amendments to any and all documents.  No paper copies of the solicitation will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile, or written requests will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>There are three major projects to this effort at the Kansas City Veterans Administration Medical Center; each one is comprised of several smaller pieces.  The work consists of renovating 2   floors within occupied medical center in the main tower, building 1. The designs for these projects have been completed by two separate A/E firms.  We will be soliciting proposals from qualified and experienced Small Business Concerns.  The proposed contract type is a Single Award, Firm-fixed-price contract with priced Option Items.  The best value is expected to result from the section of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.    An organized site visit is scheduled for:  24 APR 12 at 9:00 am.  The meeting place is at the VA Medical Center, 4801 Linwood Blvd, Building 6, room 6-210, large conference room.  POC is Dennis.Powers@va.gov, telephone number is 816-861-4700 X57593  <br>Project 589-362, Renovate 7E Dialysis - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building for operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, asbestos abatement, plumbing, HVAC, electrical, communications and other work necessary for a complete and functional dialysis unit.   There will be special water requirements for Dialysis, a Reverse Osmosis (RO) system and Dialyzing Acid system will be required.  Existing Dialysis units are portable and will be relocated and used in the new area.  <br>Project 589-363, Renovate 5th Floor Inpatient Surgery - the contractor shall completely prepare site for building Inpatient Surgery Ward and Ambulatory Surgery Operations, including demolition and removal of existing structures, and furnish labor and materials and perform work for Inpatient Surgery as required by drawings and specification.   There will be special rooms for Spinal Chord Patients and singular bed rooms for other patients including Infection Control rooms.  This Project will be completed in two phases, East first then West side for final construction.  <br>Project 589-367, Renovate 10th Floor for Inpatient Psychiatry - this project will construct a state of the art Inpatient Psychiatry ward that will accommodate patient needs to include space consideration for a treatment population of highly complex psychiatric patients comprised of general psychiatry patients, female psychiatry patients, geriatric psychiatry patients and psychiatry patients with complex medical needs. Specific attention will be given to space requirements for the protection of patient privacy, gender specific bathroom/shower areas, areas for group activities and the safety/security precautions for both patients and staff members. The 10th floor will have special Patient Safety requirements for suicide prevention. This project will be completed in 2 phases, East first then patients on the West side will be moved to the new space on the West side and West side construction will begin.  <br>The work on the 5th, 7th, and 10th floors will be concurrent.  Some work (heavy demolition, core drilling, high noise generation) will need to be scheduled other than normal business hours.  Because this is renovation work and not new construction, experience working in an operating medical facility is vital.  The VA will require the prime contractor to have documentable experience showing completed projects of similar size and scope in a hospital environment, their ability to manage subcontractors, vendors and employees within the facility and respect boundaries (noise, infection control, physical, etc).   The solicitation will be available on OR about 16 April 2012 and will be posted on FedBiz Ops and on our Contracting Division Home Page.<br> <br><br>

<AWARDEE>AKAL Security, Inc, 7 Infinity Loop, Espanola, NM 87532 US
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO) Federal protective Services, Acquisition Division (FPS AD) awarded a task order on a sole source basis to AKAL Security, 7 Infinity Loop, Espanola, NM 87532 pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.&nbsp; The proposed additional work is a task order to provide Protective Security Officer (PSO) services at various locations throughout the Pacific Islands for the period of performance of April 1, 2012 through June 30, 2012.&nbsp; This will ensure uninterrupted security in these locations between expiration of the current task order and full performance by the successful offeror under the follow-on contract.&nbsp; The total task order value is $1,325,712.15, encompassing approximately 36,015 labor hours.&nbsp; Award of a&nbsp;stand-alone short term task order for PSO services between expiration of the existing contract and performance under a long-term follow-on contract is necessary to prevent unacceptable staffing delays that would jeopardize the safety and security of federal government personnel, visitors and assets. Because of the existing gun permit laws combined with extensive screening, health, training and transition requirements for PSOs under the FPS program, another guard service firm would require at least 90-days of transition activities prior to providing FPS with a PSO force that is fully qualified, security cleared and certified in accordance with FPS contract standards.&nbsp; At this time, the incumbent contractor is the only contractor that can perform in accordance with the law.&nbsp; This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.&nbsp; The NAICS code is 561612.&nbsp; There is no solicitation package available.&nbsp; For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Diane Zientek at <a href="mailto:diane.zientek@dhs.goc">diane.zientek@dhs.goc</a>

USAMEDCOM Operation Order (OPORD) 10-70 Comprehensive Behavioral Health System of Care Campaign Plan (CBHSOC-CP) requires that all Army active duty Social Work personnel, Nursing Case Managers, Psychiatric Case Managers, Nurse Practitioners and licensed behavioral health providers be trained to provide evidenced based treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.<br><br>4. Authority Cited: 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), Soliciting from a single source.  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name or industrial mobilization).<br><br>Reason for Cited Authority: The Soldier and Family Support Branch of the Department of Behavioral Health Sciences has requested that we bypass competition and enter into negotiations with Dr. Candice Monson, who is the leading expert in training professionals in the use of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The AMEDD Center and School cannot adequately (with theoretical integrity) provide the quality of training required without Dr. Monson's team direct involvement.  Dr. Monson's team is the sole proprietors and creators of Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder treatment modality.  They are recognized throughout the field of psychology as the leading experts in the area of PTSD, therefore Full and Open Competition need not be provided for.<br><br>5. Contracting Officer Certification:  I certify this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br>Signature://ORIGINAL SIGNATURE// Date: 03/19/2012<br>Name: Melissa Oliva				<br>Title: Contracting Officer			<br>                                                                   <br>
