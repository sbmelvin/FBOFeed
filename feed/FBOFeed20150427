<DESC>Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Belvoir Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Ground Sensors, intends to negotiate a contract modification on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Gyrocam Systems, LLC (LMGS) under Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract W909MY-12-D-0017. The contract provides spare and repair parts and logistics data for 797 fielded Vehicle Optics Sensor Systems (VOSS) supporting Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The proposed modification will extend the period of performance by 2-years from the expiration of the base contract (22 August 2015) and reduce the contract ceiling from $333.3M to $180M.  The period of performance extension will provide spare and repair parts for VOSS supporting OCO, repair and reset of retrograded VOSS, and upgrade of VOSS to the Program of Record (POR) configuration.  <br>  <br> The VOSS is a gyro-stabilized, triple-sensor camera attached to a twenty-five foot telescoping-mast mounted onto blast protected vehicles. The VOSS is a commercial item that allows for standoff detection and interrogation of suspected Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) during route clearance and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) missions. The VOSS eliminates the need for Soldiers to dismount from the vehicles, thereby decreasing the risk of serious injury or loss of life.  <br>  <br> It has been determined that LMGS is the only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals and a solicitation will not be issued. However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required non-developmental VOSS spare and repair parts may submit a parts list with a corresponding quote that will considered by the agency.  Responses are to be received via e-mail to within 15 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via e-mail. No telephonic inquiries or requests will be honored.  You may forward responses to the following e-mail address: karen.e.jeter.civ@mail.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>

<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will issue a Request for Proposal on or about May 15, 2015 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFP is to solicit proposals for supply chain management of the Water Purification Systems Initiative (WPS) for the Department of Defense. This approach includes the supply chain management of 2639 NSNs. This program is designed to provide the supply, storage and distribution for multiple Federal Supply Classes for this program. This program is intended to create a supply support program for worldwide demands for WPS customers. The Government is looking to take advantage of the latest technologies, expertise, and business practices, which translate into improved support to customers at less cost.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be awarded on an all or none basis and is being solicited as 100% Small Business Set Aside. This acquisition will use a Long-Term Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity contract, five year base period with Annual Price Adjustment provisions. This solicitation includes an Add/Delete clause which allows the Government to adapt the resultant contract to the changing needs of the military customer. Award will be made using Tradeoff Source Selection Procedures with Technical and Price as the evaluation factors.</p>
<p>The Government will use a "Market Basket" pricing methodology to evaluate prices for an award. The market basket will consist of 903 of the 2639 NSNs synopsized, which will form the core priced items in CLIN 0001, and of the 903 core NSNs, those for which the prices are determined to be fair and reasonable will be activated for purchase at the time of award. The CLIN 0001 NSNs are deemed to be a combination of the highest demand items and randomly selected NSNs that have had past demands, and represent 99% percent of the anticipated dollar value of the planned acquisition. Offerors are required to submit pricing for the 903 core NSNs under CLIN 0001 on an all or none basis prior to the solicitation closing.</p>

<DESC>1.	Introduction: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 621-15-139 that requires Architect/Engineering (A/E) Design Services for a Legionella Plumbing Schematic and Controls Review at the James H. Quillen VAMC, Mountain Home, TN.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330s. The A&E Services contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Brooks Act (Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6
2.	Description: The James H. Quillen VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to design a legionella plumbing schematic and controls review for Buildings 160, 162, and 200 on the James H. Quillen VAMC campus.  The project and data must coordinate with a previous project, Water Safety Management/Legionella Prevention Plan, for critical data and information.  This project will conduct an initial water systems inventory review of the aforementioned buildings in order to determine compliance with the existing Legionella Policy, Legionella Plan, and VA guidelines where all violations are to be photographed and diagramed.  Additionally, the A&E work shall include, but is not limited to: a building plan drawing showing possible sources of contamination; creation of schematic diagrams of the building distribution of domestic water systems; schematic diagrams of building conditioning systems and any other water or steam based systems excluding fire suppression; and an identification of any infrastructure improvement projects needed to eliminate and/or reduce hazards related to growth of Legionella.
3.	All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-2 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated AE firm selected to complete the design.
4.	Interested firms should submit their current SF-330 to craig.ziegemeier@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due on May 27, 2015 at 1:00 PM (CST).  Use the following instructions for submitting your SF-330.
5.	Electronic Submission Requirements:
Unless paper offers are specifically authorized in an individual solicitation, all responses to solicitations must be submitted electronically as described below.  Responses submitted in a paper form are unacceptable and will be returned.  Failure to comply with this requirement may jeopardize the possibility of receiving an award for the contract due to noncompliance with the terms of the solicitation.  You must submit your electronic offer, and any supplemental information (such as spreadsheets, backup data, technical information), using any of the electronic formats and media described below. Additionally, contractors are notified of the award via an electronic Notice of Award e-mail.  The award document will be attached to the Notice of Award e-mail. 
a.	Acceptable Electronic Formats (Software) for Submission of Offers
i.	Files readable using the current Microsoft* Office version Products: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  Please see security note below for caution regarding use of macros. When submitting construction drawings contractors are required to submit one set in AutoCAD and one set in Adobe PDF. (purpose: contracting can open the PDF version and engineering can open AutoCAD files);

ii.	Files in Adobe* PDF (Portable Document Format) Files:  When scanning documents scanner resolution should be set to 200 dots per inch, or greater;

iii.	Other electronic format.   If you wish to submit an offer using another format other than described in these instructions, e-mail the Contracting Officer who issued the solicitation.   Please submit your request at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled closing date of the solicitation.   Request a decision as to the format acceptability and make sure you receive approval of the alternate format before using it to send your offer; and

iv.	Please note that we can no longer accept .zip files due to increasing security concerns.

b.	E-mail Submission Procedures:  For simplicity in this guidance, all submissions in response to a solicitation will be referred to as offers.

i.	Subject Line:  Include the solicitation number, name of company, and closing date of solicitation;

ii.	Size:  Maximum size of the e-mail message shall not exceed five (5) megabytes.  Only one email is permitted unless otherwise stated in this paragraph or in writing by a Contracting Officer; and

iii.	The offer will be date and time stamped by the Microsoft Email system and will be the official record of receipt for the submission.

6.	Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers
a.	Late submission of offers are outlined at FAR Parts 52.212-1(f), 52.214-7, and 52.215-1(c) (3).  Particular attention is warranted to the portion of the provision that relates to the timing of submission. 
b.	Please see FAR 15.207(c) for a description of the steps the Government shall take with regard to unreadable offers.
  
c.	To avoid rejection of an offer, vendors must make every effort to ensure their electronic submission is virus-free.  Submissions or portions thereof submitted and which the automatic system detects the presence of a virus or which are otherwise unreadable will be treated as "unreadable" pursuant to FAR Parts 14.406 and FAR 15.207(c ). 

d.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

e.	Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.  Failure to be both VERIFIED by CVE and VISIBLE on VetBiz at the time of proposal submission will result in the offeror's proposal being deemed non-responsive. All offerors are urged to contact the CVE and submit the aforementioned required documents to obtain CVE verification of their SDVOSB status if they have not already done so.
7.	All SF-330s will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria.  A "short list" of three or more firms deemed most highly rated after initial source selection will be chosen for interviews. Those firms that do not rank in the short list will be notified of their exclusion from further competition. The Government will not pay, nor reimburse, any costs associated with responding to this request. The Government is under no obligation to award a contract as a result of this announcement.  Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. The estimated magnitude for construction (not design) of this project is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.  However, it is anticipated there will not be a construction requirement for this project being that only legionella water mapping of three buildings and the identification of items that need to be resolved per VA Directive 1061 need to be accomplished via this project only.
a.	Contract Award Procedure: Before a small business is proposed as a potential contractor, they must be certified by VETbiz and registered in the System For Award Management (SAM) database. Register via the SAM internet site at www.sam.gov  Failure of a proposed SDVOSB to be certified by the CVE at the time the SF 330 is submitted shall result in elimination from consideration as a proposed contractor. The proposed services will be obtained by a Negotiated Firm-Fixed Price Contract. 
b.	The review/design of architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished by architects or engineers registered in a State or possession of the United States, or in Puerto Rico or in the District of Columbia.
c.	The project drawings/design shall be in compliance with applicable standards and codes described in VA Program Guides and design materials. Master Construction Specifications Index, VA Construction Standards Index, VA Standards Index, and Criteria are available in the Technical Information Library (TIL) on VA Website address: http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/.
8.	The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541330 with a small business size of $15 million.  The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, type in SF-330 in the "Find a Form" block and click on search.

B.4 DESCRIPTIONS/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

NON-EMERGENCY AMBULANCE TRANSPORTATION


1.  Contract Title.  Non-emergency ambulance transportation to & from the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center (JHQVAMC), Mountain Home, TN.

2.  Background.  An ambulance service is required to transport patients whose medical condition warrants them to be seen at JHQVAMC or local hospital setting and warrants them to travel by ambulance not private vehicle or other means. This contract provides non-emergent ambulance service for the JHQVAMC.

3.  Scope.  To transport Veteran patients who are medically stable for transport to & from the JHQVAMC or nearest applicable non-VA medical center. Further, JHQVAMC requires basic life support (BLS) for Veteran patient transport, and in some instances will also require advanced life support (ALS) for Veteran transportation from to & from JHQVAMC to nearest appropriate non-VA medical center and from non-VA medical center to JHQVAMC.

4.  Specific Tasks.

     Overview:  

     a. Mountain Home VA Medical Center has 529 beds in general medicine and surgery, alcohol treatment, psychiatry, nursing home care and domiciliary all under one management.  The Center is primarily affiliated with East Tennessee State University James H. Quillen College of Medicine, developed with the assistance of a VA grant and principally located on VA grounds. Active and growing residency programs of various medical surgical specialties are offered.  In addition, there are affiliations with other universities and colleges in medical, nursing, allied health, and administrative professions at the undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate levels. 

     b.  This contract includes requirements for a basic life support (BLS) vehicle staffed by an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and an advanced life support (ALS) vehicle staffed by Emergency Medical Technician Paramedic (EMTP).  The contractor shall furnish 24 hour ambulance service for the beneficiaries of the VAMC when authorized in advance by the Travel Unit staff..  

5.  Mileage Threshold/Chargeable Mileage:

     a.  The mileage threshold is thirty (30) miles from the VAMC where no additional "mileage charge" shall be added to the base rate.  For all one-way trips, the additional "mileage charge" shall apply only to those miles traveled beyond the 30 mile threshold.  In the event fraction miles result, JHQVAMC shall pay the rounded off amount to the next higher even mile.  The Bing, Dashboard Beneficiary Travel Mileage Calculator (BDBTMC) shall determine chargeable trip mileage from JHQVAMC to Veteran's home address.  The BDBTMC shall be used to calculate all chargeable mileage.  If the BDBTMC does not calculate the entire distance to the Veteran's address, JHQVAMC shall consider the actual mileage within a five to ten mile variance.  

     b.  All one-way trips ordered under the contract shall receive the base rate quoted ("Base Rate").  The Base Rate shall constitute full compensation for one-way trips, which do not exceed the mileage threshold as defined above.  The contractor shall also receive the mileage rate quoted ("Mileage Rate") for any one-way trips in excess of the mileage threshold.  The mileage rate is applicable only for mileage in excess of the mileage threshold and at no time shall the contractor receive reimbursement for mileage less than the mileage threshold.

6.  Number of Patients:  It is understood and agreed upon that only one patient shall be transported on a trip unless specifically requested by the contractor.  Pursuant to the JHQVAMC authorization, when more than one patient is transported concurrently on a trip, reimbursement shall be made at the rates contained under the pricing schedule for transporting a single patient.  Regardless of the number of patients transported concurrently on a single trip beyond the mileage threshold, the contractor shall be reimbursed at the mileage rate for one trip to the longest distance traveled with any one patient on that particular trip.  The contractor must ensure that pick-ups and drop-offs are scheduled so that the distance traveled shall result in the most economical charge to the Government. 

7.  On-Site Transportation Services:
     a. The contractor shall provide a BLS unit for transportation of patients with the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center property on an as-needed basis. The services shall be required when the VA Medical Center's vehicle is unavailable due to scheduled maintenance, mechanical malfunctions, etc. 

     b. In non-emergency situations, the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center shall notify the Contractor at least 48 hours in advance of need. In situations where the facility's vehicle is unavailable due to unexpected mechanical reasons, the Contractor shall provide service within thirty (30) minutes of notification by the VAMC

8.  Waiting Time:  Time lost in waiting at either or both ends of a trip due to causes beyond the contractor's control, the contractor shall be reimbursed at the rate of one fourth the hourly rate quoted in the contractor's proposal for each quarter hour or fraction thereof in excess of one-half hour from the time he/she reports to the designated person at JHQVAMC.  If the pickup is other than at JHQVAMC, the contractor shall call the JHQVAMC Travel Clerk first, (423) 926-1171 extension 3306 or Travel Supervisor (423) 926-1171 extension 4438 during administrative hours (7:45a.m. through 4:30p.m., Monday through Friday) or the Medical Administrative Assistant (MAA) at (423) 926-1171 and ask for the MAA on duty during non-administrative hours (during evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays) as soon as it is anticipated that a delay may develop for which the Contractor expects to claim reimbursement.  This call is only for the purpose of verifying the arrival time at the pick-up point and is not necessary if the Contractor anticipates no delay for which reimbursement will be claimed.  The Contractor's failure to follow the above stated protocol when waiting beyond the grace period shall result in non-payment for waiting time.    

9.  Service Orders:  

       a.  Request for services will be made in writing or by telephone, and subsequently confirmed in writing by individual(s) designated by the Travel Supervisor (423) 926-1171 extension 4438 or 3306 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.  After normal duty hours follow the protocol outlined in paragraph eight above.  

       b.  If the contractor fails to furnish ambulance service within 30 minutes after receiving a request for service, JHQVAMC reserves the right to obtain the service from another source and to charge the contractor excess cost/fees.  The JHQVAMC shall be the sole judge in determining when to order service from another source.  However, in no instance shall the contractor be required to furnish more than four ambulances for BLS service and two ambulances for ALS service at any one  six hour time.  When the total number of contracted vehicles is in use with JHQVAMC patients, and the JHQVAMC requires additional vehicles, the JHQVAMC shall first contact the contractor to provide additional vehicles at the contracted rate.  If additional vehicles are not available from the contractor, the JHQVAMC shall contact another ambulance provider for transport at no cost to the contractor.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking cell processing facilities for a five year renewal of the program entitled "Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT)-Cell Processing Facilities (CPFs)". The purpose of this announcement is to provide a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the release of Solicitation NHLBI-ECB-HB-2016-09-JB. The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541712 with a Size Standard of 500 employees. THIS IS A SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>Background and Program Objectives</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is planning a second competitive renewal for the Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) program for the development of clinical manufacturing protocols and production of novel somatic (biological) cell therapies for use in pre-clinical studies to be used in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications. The objective of this program is to continue to advance cellular therapy research in the areas of regeneration of damaged/diseased tissues, organs, biologic systems, and targeted treatments for serious diseases without effective therapies. This program will fund up to eight (8) geographically dispersed Cell Processing Facilities (CPFs) and one (1) Coordinating Center (CC) in the U.S. with the capacity to provide consulting, manufacturing, preclinical study, administrative, and regulatory expertise necessary for the development of novel cellular therapies in the area of heart, lung, and blood cellular therapy research. The PACT CPFs shall serve investigators within the scientific community as performance centers for translational research related to cellular therapies and manufacturers of cellular therapy products. PACT CPFs shall manufacture cellular therapy products for investigators from academia and industry needing manufacturing support. The cellular products manufactured by the CPFs are intended for non-clinical use within the United States.</p>
<p>Under this solicitation, the Government anticipates the award of eight (8) Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with cost-reimbursement and fixed-price task orders for a period of approximately&nbsp;six years with an estimated award date of July 1, 2016.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the IDIQ will be for a total of six (6) years: Five fiscal years of funding (from FY 2016 through 2020) shall be used to obligate amounts on all new task orders awarded within the five year ordering period (Years 1 through 5). No new task orders will be awarded and no funds will be obligated on existing task orders after the ordering period ends in Year 5. Up to one additional year (Year 6) shall be used to complete all unfinished work on any existing task orders awarded before the end of the ordering period.</p>
<p>The second competitive renewal of the PACT program shall continue to provide the services that were identified as essential for the advancement of cellular therapy research by the previous PACT External Advisory Panel, investigators using PACT services, NIH working groups, and NHLBI staff. These services include providing support for IND-enabling translational research, and diversifying the cell therapy expertise within the program by increasing the number of manufacturing CPFs. The PACT program will no longer provide cellular products for Phase I/II clinical trials. The Statement of Work for the second renewal also reflects operational changes in the review and selection of applications for services. The anticipated number of awards to Cell Processing Facilities was established to meet the needs of the program by diversifying the cell therapy expertise and permits the capability to manufacture and ship cell therapy products that are not feasible over lengthy distances between the facility and the requesting investigator. The program phases shall total 60 months. The corresponding Task Area(s) for each phase shall be as follows:</p>

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Southwest, San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Solicitation for a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC) for range sustainment and environmental remediation services at various locations within the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFAC SW) footprint and other Naval and Marine Corps Activities within the NAVFAC area of responsibility. This is a competitive procurement being solicited as a 100% set-aside for small business concerns.

Market research was conducted to determine whether this procurement should be set aside for small business programs.
 As a result of the market research analysis, it was determined that there are at least two (2) qualified small business firms to perform the type of work solicited. On 14 November 2013, the Small Business Program Office concurred with the 100% small business set-aside determination.

This acquisition is set-aside for qualified small business firms.  In order to qualify as a small business firm, companies must meet the requirements listed at the SBAs webpage (http://www.sba.gov/content/determining-business-size), be self-certified as a small business under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 562910, and have current registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) database.

The main focus of this contract is performance of range sustainment projects including but not limited to: range clearance; processing and recycling of range residue (defined as ordnance scrap and target debris); UXO clearance/removal/venting and disposal; explosive anomaly avoidance; range component layout/reconfiguration; range closure; small arms range sustainment, range alteration, and range renovation; target restoration/removal/replacement, renovation and sustainment; small arms berm projectile mining services.
 This acquisition encourages innovative approaches to safely and cost effectively perform range sustainment and remediation work. The additional focus of this contract is performance of range remediation projects involving environmental work such as investigations and/or remediation. Range remediation projects may include, but are not limited to; assessment and remediation of Munition Response Program (MRP) sites, restoration and/or remediation of formerly used defense sites to include both munitions components and hazardous, toxic, and radiological waste (HTRW) components.  The work to be ordered under this contract will be performed at various locations within Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southwest (NAVFAC SW) footprint.
 Work may be located in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Although these are the principal geographical areas of performance, the contractor may be required to perform at other Naval and Marine Corps activities within the NAVFAC area of responsibility. However, the majority of the work is expected to be performed in California.

The Contract term is for a base period of twelve (12) months with four (4) one-year option periods, for a maximum total maximum period of (five) 5 years. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services, with a corresponding small business size standard of 500 employees. The aggregate maximum dollar value of this procurement, including the base year and four on-year options under the resulting contracts, shall not exceed $95,000,000.
 Task Orders awarded from this contract will range between $100,000 and $5,000,000. The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered. The minimum guarantee is $5,000 for the performance period of the resulting contracts.

This acquisition will utilize the Best Value Tradeoff source selection process as described in FAR 15.101-1 with the intent to award a minimum of three and a maximum of five contracts to the offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), are the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered.  Offerors are encouraged to submit their best proposal as the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.
  The Government reserves the right not to award PTO 0001 or to award it at a later date after the award of the basic contract.

Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following factors: Factor 1  Experience of the Offeror, Factor 2  Technical Approach (PTO 0001), Factor 3  Safety, Factor 4  Management Approach, Factor 5  Past Performance, Factor 6  Price (PTO 0001).

The solicitation will be available by electronic media under pre-solicitation notice N62473-15-R-0813 and can be viewed and downloaded from Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) at https://www.neco.navy.mil and from Federal Business Opportunities online (FEDBIZOPS) located at https://www.fbo.gov on Monday, 11 May 2015.

<DESC>Questions pertaining to this announcement should be addressed to Shelia Welsh at shelia.a.welsh@usace.army.mil.  <br>  <br> PLEASE NOTE:  This is NOT a Request for Proposals.  There is no solicitation package to download.  All information required to submit the SF330 documents are contained herein. <br>  <br> 1.  CONTRACT INFORMATION:  The Seattle District Corps of Engineers has a requirement for an Architect-Engineer (A-E) Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for Electrical and Mechanical Design and Construction Support Services at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.  This procurement will be evaluated using Brooks Act (PL-92-582) procedures and FAR Part 36.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The scope and purpose of this IDIQ contract will be for the preparation of design-bid-build and design-build solicitations involving electrical and mechanical disciplines for new construction as well as renovation and repair projects; electrical and mechanical system studies; and related construction management services for Joint Base Lewis-McChord (JBLM), Washington.  Individual Task Orders to be assigned under this Contract will identify specific requirements.  The effective period of the Contract shall be a One-Year Base Period with the option to extend for four (4) additional One-Year Option Periods.  Work under this IDIQ Contract will be issued by Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders.  The Contract will have an individual Task Order limit of $500,000 per Task Order and the maximum value of all work issued under the Contract will be limited to $5,975,000 over five years.   Multiple Task Orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates.  The Government makes no representation as to the number of Task Orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Firms that design or prepare specifications for a construction Contract or Task Order issued under the resulting Contract are prohibited from participating in the subsequent construction. This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm. <br>  <br> The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541330, with a small business size standard of $15M.  For the purposes of this procurement, a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $15 million or less over the last three fiscal years.  This acquisition is a 100% TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE and is therefore open to all qualified small businesses under the NAICS code of 541330.   <br>  <br> In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Alternate A, all firms must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of any Government Contract.

Criteria are listed in descending order of importance. <br>  <br> SF 330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm. Evaluating Past <br> Performance may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. In evaluating an Offeror's capability, the Government may consider how well the offeror complied with these instructions. All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this Contract; projects not performed by the office/branch/individual team member will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  <br>  <br> FIRMS SLATED AS MOST HIGHLY QUALIFIED:  To assist the Government in selecting the most highly qualified contractor, those firms slated as highly qualified may be interviewed or asked to submit supplemental responses. <br>  <br>  <br> PRIMARY CRITERIA:  <br>  <br> SF 330, PART 1, SECTION F, CRITERION (A) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE and TECHNICAL COMPETENCE of the proposed firm.  <br>  <br> Submission Requirements: For the proposed team, provide a maximum of ten (10) specific, completed projects. Discuss conformance to scope, adherence to performance schedules, limiting changes and delivering a product that satisfies the requirements. Note: For purposes of this selection criterion, an IDIQ contract will be counted as ONE project as long as that IDIQ contract encompasses one or more completed Task Orders. <br>  <br> The evaluation will consider current and former relationships between the prime A-E firm and its proposed sub-consultants.  Projects that demonstrate specialized experience and technical competence in the following types of work may be evaluated more favorably under this criterion: 1) projects that include design of fire protection and other life/safety systems; 2) projects that include the replacement and repair of electrical utility system components and control systems; 3) projects that include electrical and mechanical system analysis and modeling, including, but not limited to: arc flash hazard analysis, protective device coordination, and development of protective device settings; 4) projects involving development, commissioning, and design of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems and automation of electrical (and other) utility systems; 5) projects involving Direct Digital Control Systems (Tridium Management Control System) and enterprise energy data recording systems (EEDRS.)   <br>  <br> SF 330, PART 1, SECTION E, CRITERION (B) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS of key personnel to be assigned to this Contract. <br>  <br>  Resumes shall be provided for proposed key personnel and proposed sub-consultants for all A-E disciplines. In the resumes under Project Assignments, use the same disciplines nomenclature as is used in this announcement. Key personnel are defined as lead designers for key disciplines, Project Manager and Quality Control Manager to be assigned to this Contract. Key personnel proposed are required to be licensed or certified professionals, as applicable. The evaluation will consider education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience.  For sub-consultant key personnel, the evaluation will also consider current and former relationships with the prime A-E firm.  It is expected that the individuals identified as key personnel will be the individuals performing these positions under the resulting contract. Any changes to the proposed key team members after submission of qualifications MUST be approved by the Contracting Officer.   <br>  <br> Submission Requirements: Provide brief resumes of each proposed team member who will specifically perform the major tasks in the disciplines listed above under this Contract. Provide the highest level of education achieved and the number of years engaged in the discipline. Each resume shall include a maximum of five (5) specific completed projects that best illustrate the individual member's qualifications for the position for which the key member is being proposed. Completed projects are defined as those in which the firm's performance of the task for which it was hired (i.e. design and/or construction support services) is complete. Please note if the proposed team members have worked together on other projects (provide a specific example(s)). <br>  <br> Projects submitted where the key member has performed in the role proposed for this Contract may be evaluated more favorably. As referenced in the SF 330, Part A, Section F, provide an organization chart identifying each member of the project team. As a minimum, key personnel must be included.  <br>  <br> SF 330, SECTION H, CRITERION (C) PAST PERFORMANCE of the firm and the project team on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. In its evaluation of past performance, in addition to information submitted by the firm, the Government will consider information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other sources deemed necessary by the Government. Firms are encouraged to contact the appropriate Government Project Managers, Contracting Officers, or Contracting Officer's Representatives to ensure CPARS (formerly called ACASS) evaluations have been submitted on completed Government projects, particularly for those projects submitted under Criteria A and B. <br>  <br> Submission Requirements: Provide a brief narrative that demonstrates past performance and indicates effectiveness on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. It is the responsibility of the firm to explain how the past performance information is relevant to the proposed Contract. Firms may also provide information on problems encountered in prior contracts and discuss actions taken to remedy unsatisfactory performance. Identify recent awards, commendations, and other performance evaluations outside of CPARS.  <br>  <br> Past performance on the types of projects described in paragraph 2, above, will be given additional consideration under this criterion.   <br>  <br> SF 330, SECTION H, CRITERION (D) CAPACITY of the proposed team to accomplish the work of the required type and the dollar amount stated in this announcement.  <br>  <br> Submission Requirements: Describe the firm's ability to utilize an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines and the proposed team's ability to complete several large and small multidisciplinary Task Orders concurrently requiring quick turn-around.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting proposals and subsequently awarding a single, Firm-Fixed-Price contract for the Design-Bid-Build construction of a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant and New Steam Generation System at the Dublin, GA VA Medical Center (VAMC). 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
In an effort to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption, the Department of Veterans Affairs has commissioned the construction of the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant and New Steam Generation System project at the Dublin VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Dublin, Laurens County, Georgia.
It is currently planned that the CHP and New Steam Generation System construction project will consist of a single 1.2 megawatt natural-gas fired, spark ignition engine generator which will provide peak-shaving electricity for the entire Dublin VAMC Campus.  The engine's rejected heat will be used to produce both steam and hot water with a portion of the steam driving a new 150-ton absorption chiller.  The prime gen set will provide a new, reliable, and efficient source of electrical generation, steam, as well as hot and cold water for the VAMC campus.  In addition, operation of the CHP will reduce emission levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gases when compared to conventional means of power generation and distribution.  Planned facility upgrades will also include replacement of the three (3) existing boilers with five (5) new 250-BHP dual-fired, fire-tube boilers with a new control room.
The project will include the construction of a new ~6,500 square foot building to house the generator and associated mechanical and electrical equipment.  The ground level of this two-story, pre-cast building will house the generator set (with a spare pad) with the heat-recovery steam generator placed on the mezzanine level.  The ground level will also accommodate two of the five boilers, with the remaining three being placed within the existing boiler room.  The 1st level will house the necessary electrical equipment.  Roof mounted equipment will include remote radiators and ventilation exhaust hoods.  New controls systems will integrate the new CHP plant and boilers into the facilities existing systems. CHP Plant designed to reduce sound via mass walls in chase & critical grade mufflers. New parallel switchgear will be installed and connections made within the existing switchgear building downstream of the existing meters (It must be noted that any required Georgia Power design services and/or infrastructure improvements have yet to be determined).
The design includes the addition of a 150-ton absorption chiller in the existing Chilled Water Plant and replacement of two existing 500 ton chillers in kind at that same location.  The addition of the absorption chiller will displace the existing motor control center, air handler, and strainer.  A new stand-alone building (approximately 20-foot by 27-foot) will be constructed adjacent to the Chilled Water Plant to house the displaced exiting motor control center.  The air handler and strainer will be reconfigured within the existing chiller plant.  The existing three-cell cooling tower will be replaced in kind re-using the foundation of the existing.
The Dublin VAMC lies within an attainment area, therefore, the generator will not require air emissions control equipment to meet regulatory requirements.  It is currently anticipated that the CHP plant can be permitted as a Synthetic Minor Air Source under current State of Georgia emissions regulations.  This project will attempt to obtain two (2) Green Globes utilizing the sustainability measurement tool of the Green Building Initiative (GBI). 
ADMINISTRATIVE:
The solicitation will be issued as a "Request For Proposal" (RFP) conducted in accordance with FAR Parts 15, 19, and 36 and will be evaluated in accordance with the procedures listed in the solicitation. The solicitation will be advertised as a total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside. Offers received from other than Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns will not be considered.  All Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses must be verified by the VA's Center for Veterans Enterprises (CVE) (http://www.vetbiz.gov).  The applicable NAICS code is 237130 with a size standard of $36.5 million. The solicitation will be issued on or about May 12, 2015.  The period of performance is approximately 540 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice to Proceed.  This notice is not a request for competitive offers. The Magnitude of Construction is expected to be between $10,000,000.00 and $20,000,000.00. All questions must be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email to donald.marsh2@va.gov. Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Request for Information  <br> Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Huachuca Division is conducting market research to identify industry solutions to future Intelligence capability requirements.  The Government invites all business/academic concerns to respond to this request for information notice.    <br>  <br> This is a request for information (RFI) only.  This is not a solicitation for quotations and no contract will be awarded from this notice.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.  All information submitted in response to this RFI is voluntary.  As result of the RFI, qualified candidates may be invited to Military Intelligence (MI)-Innovation Day, at Fort Huachuca, AZ. The Government will use responses to consider potential candidates for invitation to demonstrate and/or further discuss capabilities/technologies to Military Intelligence (MI) Innovation Day, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona or other designated events.  <br>  <br> All questions pertaining to this RFI are to be submitted via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Katrina Wimmer at katrina.m.wimmer.civ@mail.mil and the Contract Specialist, Ms. Emily Harston at emily.m.harston.civ@mail.mil.  The applicable paragraph number shall precede all questions.  The Government requests that you submit questions to the RFI not later than 04 May 2015, 09:00 AM Mountain Standard Time (MST), to allow the Government sufficient time to respond prior to the response date. <br>  <br> 1.  Interested contractors should provide a single quad chart and white paper (1-4 pages) per topic (templates provided) to describe their proposed solution; including technologies, techniques and/or advanced research areas applicable to the required capabilities described herein No Later Than (NLT) than 26 May 2015. The RFI is not only seeking technologically solutions, but also seeking an understanding of where advanced research may be heading applicable to the below topics. <br>  <br> 2. Background: MI Innovation Day, hosted by US Army Intelligence Center of Excellence (ICoE), scheduled for 27-30 July, is conducted at the end of Enterprise Challenge (EC15). MI- Innovation day will include a set of technology demonstrations and requirements discussions with capability developers from ICoE. MI-Innovation Day will be a unique ICoE event which will drive market research to inform Capabilities Development & Integration (CDI) of capabilities available to support strategies for Force 2025(F2025) efforts.  <br>  <br> F2025 is a campaign plan developed by Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) for the Total Army that drives proactive, long-term focused modernization.  In the near term, 2014-2020, the Army adopts an expeditionary, future-focused mindset, and through agile and adaptive leaders and improved resilient networks (cyberspace), becomes more globally responsive and capable.  In the mid-term, 2020-30, the Army is leaner, more lethal, expeditionary, and agile, retains overmatch against increasingly capable adversaries, and sets conditions for the 2030-40 timeframe.  In the far term, 2030-40, the Army is significantly improved through organizational force designs with new operational concepts and advanced technologies, and with operationally significant forces, conducts expeditionary maneuver to influence events in near-real time to achieve strategic objectives.  <br>  <br> Within TRADOC,  quote mark the Army Warfighting Challenges (AWFCs) provide an analytical framework to integrate efforts across warfighting functions while collaborating with key stakeholders in learning activities, modernization, and future force design quote mark  (The U.S. Army Operating Concept, 7 Oct 2014). While Army intelligence has equities in several of the twenty AWFCs, no question is more important to Army Intelligence than the following:  quote mark How does the Army develop and sustain a high degree of situational understanding while operating in complex environments against determined, adaptive enemy organizations? quote mark  It is the exploration of this question that has initiated the need to revise and adapt our current required capabilities. From a development standpoint, F2025B drives proactive modernization and innovation to meet external and internal challenges over the next twenty years.  The Army must develop a leaner, more lethal, expeditionary, and agile force that retains overmatch against increasingly capable adversaries while setting conditions for the period beyond 2025. <br>  <br> This RFI is focused on a few select capability topics from within various ICoE, CDI departments. The capability topics are organized into near, mid and far term focus areas. Replies to the RFI must identify which respective requirement they are providing information towards.  <br>  <br> 3. Requirements: <br>  <br> NEAR TERM: <br> Support Tactical Small Unit Intelligence On the Move (OtM): Analysis solutions enabling the Intelligence Analyst to create, modify and disseminate graphic and text items to both Command and Control (C2) and intelligence systems in use at lower tactical echelons such as the Company and Battalion level while OtM and at the quick halt.  A smart and efficient capability for disconnected/disadvantaged users to obtain data updates, with the least burden to Army tactical networks, is required. Identify/inform on capabilities to support All Source analyst OtM: <br>  	Support for intermittent and disadvantaged/disconnected activities. Gain and/or maintain access to the Intelligence Enterprise to enable processing, exploitation and dissemination of intelligence and/or information. <br> -	Advanced bandwidth efficiency and data compression.  <br> -	Ability to auto-detect/discover/redirect data on available networks. <br> -	Ability to access future Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR) and Mission Command data access points.  <br>  	Enable Situation Awareness  <br> -	Ability to support information Retrieval, Display, Dissemination, Monitoring. <br> -	Conduct small unit level processing, exploitation of intelligence and/or combat information. <br> -	Ability to use analytical tools when disconnected. <br>  	Synchronize intelligence operations and analysis with military operations <br> -	Enable sharing of Situation Understanding with mounted and dismounted Company and Battalion (BN) level systems. (i.e. mapping/graphic capabilities, analysis, targeting support products). <br>  	Mobile Interface considerations for small displays <br> -	User will not always have two hands to use on the device  <br> -	Transition interface options; from mobile to desktop style operations <br> -	Use in black-out light conditions; to support tactical movement at night or red-lighting conditions. <br>  <br> Human Domain: The Chief of Staff of the Army guidance is for Soldiers to learn  quote mark faster, better and more deeply quote mark .  Better learning is often covered under the umbrella of Army Learning Model (ALM) which focuses on the  quote mark learner quote mark .   <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities or techniques the Army Intelligence Corps can leverage in the human domain to accelerate individual and team learning in live environments and simulations. <br>  	As we look at this three legged stool (faster, better and more deeply) we would like to learn more about the ability to learn faster, the metrics by which you measure such speed, and the potential impact on  quote mark better and more deeply quote mark  as we strive to learn faster.    <br>  <br> NEAR & MID-TERM <br>  <br> Tactical Mesh Sensor System (TMS2): Identify/inform on capabilities that can employ, manage, and configure software defined radios with cognitive capabilities as a mesh sensor array.  Sensors may leverage tactical ground vehicles, tactical air platforms or other platforms to support a mesh.  <br>  <br>  	Seeking innovative enhancements to existing Government off-the-shelf/Commercial off-the-shelf (GOTS/COTS).  <br>  	Execute collaborative radio frequency collection, direction finding, and multipath data relay within a secure, self-forming, self-healing, Internet Protocol-based, open architecture. <br>  	Format collected data in accordance with specified DoD standards for Intelligence analysis. <br>  	Enable Size Weight and Power (SWaP) reduction and improved sustainment by integrating several functionalities onto a single collection and processing platform.  <br>  	Distributed Sensor discovery and management within a network. <br>  <br> Sensor Common Operating Picture (COP): The Sensor COP has two (2) components; a common vocabulary and automated management/visualization. Identify situational awareness applications and inform on efforts that codify a common Sensor ontology that can employ on current or near-term Mission Command and Intelligence systems/devices.  <br> Inform on capabilities that enable: <br>  	Commanders to see real-time and near real-time gaps in collection as well as all assets and resources available; and should provide tools to better synchronize organic and non-organic collection capabilities to satisfy ever-expanding information requirements.  <br>  	The display of all friendly traditional and non-traditional collection resources at the scale of the user's choosing. It must interact with near-term and mid-term Army physical sensor capability requirements. Thus enabling tactical and operational intelligence staffs to have automated visualization of ISR asset discovery, availability and status for mission planning and management and consistently, accurately, and confidently answer these questions in near-real time: <br> . Where are sensors? <br> . What named and targeted areas of interest Named Are of Interest/Target Area of Interest (NAI/TAI)) can the sensors see? <br> . What NAI/TAI areas can't the sensors see? <br> . What NAI/TAI may be seen by more than one sensor? <br> . Where are my opportunities for cross-cuing? <br> . Where do I have unnecessary redundancy? <br> . Which sensors are effective or ineffective and why? <br>  <br> Foreign Language Translation:  With the lack of Human Linguists the military requires foreign language capabilities to communicate with the indigenous population while on patrol, manning a checkpoint, or performing any other duty which requires interaction with local foreign populace. Capabilities that directly translates the responses you receive from the locals and an understanding of oral and written communication in a foreign language is fundamental to effective operations.  <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities/techniques to improve real-time audio translation, faster speed of translation and more accurate translation including use of idioms and cultural references.   <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities for automatic visual and audio translation and embedded translation capabilities into small, lightweight wearable devices.  <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities for language translation tools to learn, and get better at a language; automatic adaption techniques to nuisances like accents, tone, stuttering, repetition and pauses in speech.   <br>  	Identify/inform on Optical Character Recognition capabilities (OCR) for English and Foreign Languages (Arabic, Dari, Farsi and Korean): Documents scanned for translation are anticipated to have some level of  quote mark noise quote mark  whether it be smears, wrinkles, dirt, extraneous markings or otherwise.  <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Noisy Environments for English and Foreign Languages (Dari, Farsi and Korean): Soldiers operate devices in environments that are usually filled with background noise (generators, vehicles, aircraft, music, wind, people talking).   <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities or techniques that can diminish the impact of background noise on ASR and the resulting machine translation output.   <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities for Machine Translation (MT) in Foreign Languages (Dari, Farsi, and Korean and Arabic Dialects of Yemeni, Levantine, Egyptian and Gulf):  The Army has identified other follow-on languages necessary to support the Army and DoD.  MT must support 2-way translation (MT must support both English to foreign language and foreign language to English).  <br>  <br>  <br> Intelligence Support to Cyber Operations:  Cyber-attacks remain a threat to U.S. government and military operations, resulting in lost, stolen, and manipulated data and causing serious damage and disruption to operations at a cost of billions of U.S. dollars annually.   U.S. Forces face challenges in how to proactively prevent and deter adversarial cyber operations.  Regarding cyber threats, we need to know methods or solutions that can help forces: <br> -	Identify Who may be targeting the network.   <br> -	Identify What are their intentions, motivations, and capabilities. <br> -	Identify When will they conduct their operations. <br> -	Identify Where adversarial activity originates. <br> -	Identify How-tactics, techniques, and procedures the adversary intends to use to penetrate or affect the network? <br>  <br>  	Identify/inform on capabilities and or techniques that could aid in detecting, denying, disrupting, degrading, deceiving, and destroying adversarial cyber capabilities and efforts expeditiously.

<DESC>The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) seeks concept paper submissions to meet requirements for its Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 15-001, Section V, Topic Area H, Biomedical Translational Initiative. <br>  <br> Summary <br>  <br> Severe hemorrhage, particularly non-compressible torso and junctional hemorrhage, continues to be the leading cause of US deaths in combat.  In collaboration with NHRC, the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) has a requirement to develop novel strategies to control severe hemorrhage on the battlefield.  Recent advancements in endovascular technology have led USAMRMC researchers to reexamine the effectiveness of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) as a technique for controlling torso hemorrhage in austere combat environments and as an alternative to less field-expedient techniques such as thoracotomy and aortic cross clamping.  NHRC and USAMRMC are seeking support in further developing the REBOA technology and delivery prototypes that can support military specifications and a label indication for trauma that will allow for better operational adaptability and use in austere environments.   <br>  <br> Research Objectives: <br>  <br> The Government seeks new developments in REBOA technology with the overall objective of controlling hemorrhage from non-compressible injuries while maintaining vital blood pressure and circulation to the brain and heart.  The prototype or delivery mediums must be indicated for use in trauma and have potential for point-of-injury care in austere combat environments.  Specific objectives include: <br>  <br>  	Fluoroscopy-independent placement of balloon catheter <br>  	Minimization of time needed to place catheter <br>  	Low profile/small sheath size <br>  	Integrated arterial pressure monitoring, allowing operator to monitor blood pressure above and below the balloon <br>  	Minimization of prototype weight and volume <br>  	Safeguards against balloon overinflation and inadvertent vessel perforation <br>  	Ruggedization of device to withstand field conditions and maximize protection against patient infection <br>  <br> Submission Instructions: <br>  <br> Interested Vendors can go to the following website for details on concept paper submission:  http://www3.natick.army.mil/NHRC-Broad-Agency-Announcement.aspx.  All Concept Papers should be submitted to the NHRC POC below by Friday May 8th, 3:30 PM EST. <br>  <br> Naval Health Research Center <br> Science Acquisition Support Directorate <br> ATTN: Dr. Edward Gorham <br> 140 Sylvester Rd, San Diego, CA 92106 <br> 619-524-9876, edward.d.gorham2.civ@mail.mil

Pertinent generator short-circuit decrement curve and generator damage point
The largest feeder circuit breaker in each motor control center and applicable panelboard.
Provide adequate time margins between device characteristics such that selective operation is provided, while providing proper protection.
2.04	ARC FLASH HAZARD ANALYSIS
The arc flash hazard analysis shall be performed according to the IEEE Std. 1584-2002 equations that are presented in NFPA70E-2015, Annex D.
The flash protection boundary and the incident energy shall be calculated at all equipment location referenced in 1.01D.  
The Arc-Flash Hazard Analysis shall include all significant locations in 240 volt and 208 volt systems fed from transformers equal to or greater than 125 kVA where work could be performed on energized parts.  
Safe working distances shall be based upon the calculated arc flash boundary considering an incident energy of 1.2 cal/cm2.
When appropriate, the short circuit calculations and the clearing times of the phase overcurrent devices will be retrieved from the short-circuit and coordination study model.  Ground overcurrent relays should not be taken into consideration when determining the clearing time when performing incident energy calculations 
The short-circuit calculations and the corresponding incident energy calculations for multiple system scenarios must be compared and the greatest incident energy must be uniquely reported for each equipment location.  Calculations must be performed to represent the maximum and minimum contributions of fault current magnitude for all normal and emergency operating conditions. The minimum calculation will assume that the utility contribution is at a minimum and will assume a minimum motor contribution (all motors off). Conversely, the maximum calculation will assume a maximum contribution from the utility and will assume the maximum amount of motors to be operating.  Calculations shall take into consideration the parallel operation of synchronous generators with the electric utility, where applicable.
The incident energy calculations must consider the accumulation of energy over time when performing arc flash calculations on buses with multiple sources. Iterative calculations must take into account the changing current contributions, as the sources are interrupted or decremented with time.  Fault contribution from motors and generators should be decremented as follows:
Fault contribution from induction motors should not be considered beyond 3-5 cycles.
Fault contribution from synchronous motors and generators should be decayed to match the actual decrement of each as closely as possible (e.g. contributions from permanent magnet generators will typically decay from 10 per unit to 3 per unit after 10 cycles).
For each equipment location with a separately enclosed main device (where there is adequate separation between the line side terminals of the main protective device and the work location), calculations for incident energy and flash protection boundary shall include both the line and load side of the main breaker.
When performing incident energy calculations on the line side of a main breaker (as required per above), the line side and load side contributions must be included in the fault calculation.
Mis-coordination shall be checked amongst all devices within the branch containing the immediate protective device upstream of the calculation location and the calculation shall utilize the fastest device to compute the incident energy for the corresponding location.
Arc Flash calculations shall be based on actual overcurrent protective device clearing time. Maximum clearing time will be capped at 2 seconds based on IEEE Std. 1584-2002 section B.1.2.  Where it is not physically possible to move outside of the flash protection boundary in less than 2 seconds during an arc flash event, a maximum clearing time based on the specific location shall be utilized.
2.05	REPORT SECTIONS
Input data shall include, but not be limited to the following:
Feeder input data including feeder type (cable or bus), size, length, number per phase, conduit type (magnetic or non-magnetic) and conductor material (copper or aluminum).
Transformer input data, including winding connections, secondary neutral-ground connection, primary and secondary voltage ratings, kVA rating, impedance, % taps and phase shift.

<DESC>Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP) - Prizes and Challenges, NNM15ZZP003L AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Request for Information by May 31, 2015.  Responses must be submitted in electronic form no later than May 30, 2015 to Mr. Michael Hetle, Program Executive, ARMD Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street SW, Washington DC 20546-0001.  E-mail address: <a href="mailto:michael.hetle@nasa.gov">michael.hetle@nasa.gov </a> .  For general information on NASA Challenges Programs, see: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/challenges">http://www.nasa.gov/challenges </A>   . SUMMARY:  This notice is issued in accordance with 51 U.S.C. 20144 and The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451, et seq.) amended; PRIZE AUTHORITY Section. 314. NASA ARMDs Prizes and Challenges Program seeks to stimulate innovation in technologies that have value to NASA and the nation through open prize competitions that directly engage the public, academia, and industry.  NASA is seeking non-traditional approaches through expanded outreach opportunities, which appeal to broad and diverse interests, and may enable a viable technology demonstration and solution to difficult challenge problem sets. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is fourfold: (1) determine a Fast Computing community of interest in competing for a potential challenge, (2) gather realistic feedback on the statement of challenge that are contained in the text body of this RFI, (3) identify a realistic timeline to demonstrate a Fast Computing leap in technological ability, and (4) identify potential partners interested in (a) validating the value in Technology Readiness Level (TRL) demonstration in the arena of Fast Computing, (b) assisting NASA in managing and executing this prize challenge, which may include the qualification of potential competitors.  A draft set of competition rules and terms for this prize challenge, to give potential competitors and partners more insight into the scope, performance and technical sophistication of the contest. This RFI is for informational purposes only and the Government will not pay for the information received.  This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government to enter into any agreement or obligation or to conduct a Fast Computing prize challenge. This document is for informational and planning purposes and to gauge interest from the community in participation.  The Government welcomes all segments of industry, academia, and government, including associations and trade groups, innovators, individuals and enthusiasts to reply. <p> Responses should be submitted in Adobe PDF or Microsoft Word format and are limited to five (5) pages in length inclusive of any graphics or attachments.  Responses should include (as applicable): name, address, email address, and phone number of the respondent, business, or organization, with point of contact for business or organization.  Submissions should include a realistic timeline for achievement and demonstration of Fast Computing goals. All responses are to be for general access by U.S. Government evaluators and comments are submitted with the understanding that NASA may provide summary solicitation results to the public. Responses must be submitted in electronic form not later than May 31, 2015 to Mr. Michael Hetle, Program Executive, ARMD Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street SW, Washington DC 20546-0001.  E-mail address: <a href="mailto:michael.hetle@nasa.gov">michael.hetle@nasa.gov </a> . DATES:	Due date for responses to this RFI is May 31, 2015. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Statement of difficult problem set related to aeronautical research and development applications of Fast Computing.  Advanced computational tools, such as high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) not only enable reductions in ground-based and in-flight testing requirements, but also provide added physical insight, enable superior designs at reduced cost and risk, and open new frontiers in aerospace vehicle design and performance. The cross-cutting computational technology impacts three of the ARMD strategic thrusts (i.e., Innovation in Commercial Supersonic Aircraft, Ultra-efficient Commercial Vehicles and Transition to Low-Carbon Propulsion) and also supports the development of launch vehicles and planetary entry systems.  Despite tremendous progress made in the past few decades, CFD tools are too slow for simulation of complex geometry flows, particularly those involving flow separation and multi-physics (e.g., combustion) applications. To enable high-fidelity CFD for multi-disciplinary analysis and design, the speed of computation must be increased by orders of magnitude. This critical need was recognized by the recent CFD Vision 2030 Study conducted by industry and academia under NASAs sponsorship. Opportunities exist to reduce time to solution by orders of magnitude by exploiting algorithmic developments in such areas as grid adaptation, higher-order methods and efficient solution techniques for high performance computing hardware. A potential prize challenge will require that speed gains are to be achieved primarily by algorithmic enhancements, not by hardware (i.e., scaling to larger number of cores). Also, the speedup must be applicable across the Mach number regime from subsonic to hypersonic. The challenge will provide selected base geometries and flow conditions and time it takes to perform simulations using NASAs FUN3D code. Participants will solve same problems and demonstrate efficiency enhancements by implementing innovative numerical algorithms in NASA CFD codes, or in their own CFD codes, without compromising solution accuracy. <p> Thus the problem that now takes 3000 wall-clock hours on 3000 cores, for example, will reduce to 30 or 3 hours for 100x or 1000x speed up, respectively. These would be considered to be gains and, thus, Fast Computing capability will allow high-fidelity multidisciplinary analysis to be used in early stages of vehicle development, resulting in novel configurations that are energy efficient and environment friendly toward research and development objectives. <p> I. Prize Amounts: The purse for demonstrating a LEVEL I - 100x speed up is planned to be two hundred twenty five thousand U.S. dollars; the purse for demonstrating a LEVEL II - 1000x speed up is planned to be five hundred thousand U.S. dollars.  Up to 20 percent of the prize purse may be used to reward competitors for successful completion of a qualification round for both LEVEL I, and, LEVEL II.  Prizes will be offered to entrants that meet specific requirements detailed should a challenge be announced. II.  Eligibility: To be eligible to win a prize, the competitor must (1) register and comply with all requirements in the rules and enter into a team agreement; (2) in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, where participating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; and (3) shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The point of contact is Mr. Michael Hetle, Program Executive, ARMD Transformative Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP), NASA Headquarters, 300 E Street SW, Washington DC 20546-0001.

<DESC>This Opportunity Notice (hereinafter NOTICE) is for informational/planning purposes only and the Government will not pay for the information received.  This NOTICE is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the government to enter into any agreement or other obligation or to conduct a prize competition.  <p> This NOTICE is issued in accordance with the NASA Prize Authority, 51 U.S.C.  20144. <p> I.	INTRODUCTION <p> Through this NOTICE, NASA seeks to identify potential partner organizations (hereinafter Allied Organizations) for the Space Robotics Challenge to be conducted for the Space Technology Mission Directorates Centennial Challenges Program, NASAs flagship program for technology prize competitions. <p> NASA will provide the monetary prize purse (which can be supplemented by outside organizations) that is awarded to competition winners. NASA will not provide any funds or cost reimbursement to an Allied Organization for their work on a Challenge. Allied Organizations may administer a Challenge with their own funding or they may acquire the funding from partnerships with sponsoring organizations or through other means.  <p> Sponsoring organizations are those entities that partner with an Allied Organization to contribute funding for administrative expenses or in-kind support through separate agreements between the Allied Organization and the sponsoring organization.  <p> Organizations interested in becoming an Allied Organization should submit a response describing their capabilities. Details on the essential capabilities of Allied Organizations are provided in Section VII of this NOTICE. <p> Based upon a review of the capabilities of the proposed Allied Organization NASA may consider partnerships with several proposed Allied Organizations to pursue their proposed Challenges.  Participation in a Challenge as an Allied Organization will be contingent upon selection by NASA and negotiation of an appropriate Nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement between NASA and the proposer.  <p> II. ELIGIBILITY TO BE AN ALLIED ORGANIZATION <p> Under 51 U.S.C.  20144, NASA is only allowed to partner with private, domestic, U.S. non-profit organizations as Allied Organizations for Challenges of the type described by this Notice.  Organizations of any type, and individuals, may collaborate and submit a joint response describing their support of a designated private, domestic, U.S. non-profit organization that would lead the Challenge effort as the Allied Organization. <p> Neither Allied Organizations, their collaborators, nor employees, associates nor students associated with the proposing institutions will be eligible to win a prize funded by NASA in a Challenge that they manage.  Allied Organizations, collaborators, and their officers and employees may not have a financial or other interest in any teams that compete in any Challenge they manage. <p> Multiple organizations may form partnerships to manage a Challenge and may submit a joint proposal. <p> III. SPACE ACT AGREEMENT <p> A Nonreimbursable Space Act Agreement (SAA) will specify the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the Allied Organization for execution of the Space Robotics Challenge. <p> The agreement will address intellectual property rights, concurrence on rules, team agreements, media rights, insurance, registration fees and eligibility, term, and related areas as well as other requirements imposed by 51 U.S.C.  20144 and applicable law. NASA reserves the right to select for SAA negotiations all, some, or none of the responses submitted to this NOTICE, and in the event no responses are selected, NASA reserves the right to post an additional NOTICE or NOTICES with respect to new Challenges.  Respondents will be responsible for funding their own activities associated with responding to this NOTICE, as well as further developing and conducting a Challenge. Allied Organizations may collect reasonable registration fees from competitors but the use of registration fees as a primary means to cover Challenge administration costs is discouraged.  <p> For additional information regarding Space Act Agreements, see NASA Policy Directive 1050.1 Authority to Enter into Space Act Agreements (<A HREF="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPD&c=1050&s=1H">http://nodis3.gsfc.na sa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPD&c=1050&s=1H </A>  ). <p> IV. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND <p> The NASA Centennial Challenges Program was established to conduct prize competitions to generate innovative solutions to technical problems of interest to NASA and the nation. Those competing for the NASA monetary prizes can be individuals, independent teams, student groups, research organizations or private companies, but they cannot receive government funding to support any of their work related to the technical area of the prize Challenge.  <p> The Program seeks unconventional solutions from non-traditional sources and, thereby, hopes to identify new talent and stimulate the creation of new businesses.  Unlike contracts and grants based on proposals, prizes are only awarded after competitors have successfully demonstrated their innovations.  Competitors retain ownership of their intellectual property. <p> To be eligible to win a NASA Centennial Challenge monetary prize, an individual or entity shall have registered to participate in the competition pursuant to any rules promulgated by NASA; shall have complied with all the rules of the competition and requirements of applicable law; in the case of a private entity, shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States, and in the case of an individual, whether participating singly or in a group, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States; and shall not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. <p> Centennial Challenges in the past have typically required several annual competitions to occur before the total prize purses have been claimed.	Competitions may be conducted in a first-to-demonstrate format or in a head-to-head contest format.  The competition events, especially in the head-to-head contest format, typically involve public spectators, televised or Webcasted coverage, and are high-visibility opportunities for public outreach and education.	Additional information can be found at www.nasa.gov/challenges <p> V. ALLIED ORGANIZATIONS  ESSENTIAL CAPABILITIES <p> Allied Organizations will be responsible for some, or all, of the following during the formulation and execution phases: Challenge planning, Challenge formulation and execution funding, Competitor recruitment and registration, Challenge administration and execution and Challenge marketing and publicity <p> VI. CHALLENGE CONCEPT <p> The specific Challenge for which Allied Organizations are sought with this NOTICE  is the Space Robotics Challenge. The focus of this Challenge is to develop software code to operate a humanoid robot that can complete specific tasks associated with space exploration.  The prize purse is anticipated to be $2.0 million. <p> A description of the Challenge, outlining NASAs objectives, is provided in the appendix to this NOTICE.  NASA previously released a Request for Information seeking comments on the potential challenge. The RFI link is <A HREF="http://go.usa.gov/3xyQj">http://go.usa.gov/3xyQj </A>   .

Questions regarding this NOTICE should be directed to Sam Ortega, Program Manager for Centennial Challenges, Space Technology Mission Directorate; <a href="mailto:HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mail.nasa.gov">HQ-STMD-CentennialChallenges@mai l.nasa.gov </a> .  For further information on the NASA Centennial Challenges Program see: <A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/challenges">http://www.nasa.gov/challenges </A>   . <p> APPENDIX - Description of New Challenge <p> Space Robotics Challenge <p> Objectives Develop the software to control a robotic platform to perform a sequence of tasks related to in-space tasks and spacecraft maintenance. <p> Description The Space Robotics Challenge is currently contemplated as a dual level, two-track challenge. The Level I challenge would involve a virtual challenge competition in software simulation and the Level II demonstration challenge would involve use of software to control a robot to perform sequences of tasks. Both Levels of the challenge would have a Track A and Track B option. A competitor would pick only one track in which to compete. Track A would utilize the Robonaut 2 platform and focus on simulated in-space tasks such as spacecraft maintenance and operations in transit to Mars, while Track B would utilize the R5 platform robot to perform simulated tasks on planetary surfaces, such as pre-cursor habitat deployment on Mars, or disaster relief in an industrial setting on Earth. The challenge would award prizes for the highest scoring U.S. competitors in the Level I virtual challenge and the Level II demonstration challenge. For the challenge, Robonaut 2 would have autonomous climbing capabilities using International Space Station certified handrails and could operate in the Active Response Gravity Offload System (ARGOS) at NASA JSC to provide a 0g analog. This would allow Track A to focus on mobile manipulation in a microgravity environment. The R5 platform would have autonomous walking capabilities for smooth terrain so that Track B could focus on mobile manipulation and irregular mobility maneuvers on surfaces. Representative tasks expected for each track are listed below. <p> Track A using Robonaut 2 platform: Swap out modular replacement units located 5 meters away; inspect inventory requiring handling of soft-good materials; repair and/or replace a damaged component to space craft (e.g. handrails, valves, solar panels); remove and replace internal panels for space craft inspection. <p> Track B using the R5 platform, formerly known as Valkyrie: exit a habitat airlock hatch and use a ladder to reach the surface; remove a communications/power cable from a soft-goods storage location and attach it to a connector located at least 10 meters away, while traversing an irregular ruble strewn terrain, like the surface Mars or a post-earthquake industrial plant; repair or replace damaged components on complex equipment, such as a broken valve or damaged tire on a planetary rover; move dangerous debris and collect or recover desired samples or items, such as industrial plant environment samples or Mars soil/rocks. <p> Level I challenge tasks would be modeled after the physical challenge tasks, but would be performed in simulation. The key challenge requirements are to develop autonomous software that would allow for either supervisory or autonomous control modes to perform a complex sequence of tasks.  The sequence of tasks would involve both mobility and dual-armed manipulation, on either a walking robot or a climbing robot (for in-space applications). The task in a sequence that shall be completed in autonomous mode would be revealed just prior to competition, so that generic approaches to autonomy are considered. <p> For the Level I challenge, simulations of both Robonaut 2 and the R5 platform would be provided, with necessary environment dynamics. The virtual challenge would be competed online using cloud-based servers. The R5 platform and Robonaut 2 platforms would be available for preparing for the final challenge. Robots would be accessible at NASA Johnson Space Center, and NASA is currently seeking separate proposals for hosting R5 platform robots around the country. <p> Prize Purse $2.0 million is available from the Centennial Challenges Program.  This amount can be supplemented with funds from other sources. <p> Educational Opportunities Example: A robotic competition with similar space exploration tasks for students along with the main Space Robotics Challenge.  Additional prize money may be available for student-level competitions.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: <br />Indian Health Service Online Familiarization Training<br /><br />INTRODUCTION
<p>This is an unrestricted Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified sources; (2) whether they are other than small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program of the Indian Health Service resides within the Office of Clinical and Preventive Services and was developed to train healthcare facility care teams in the Model for Improvement within a context of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model. The program began in 2007 as the Chronic Care Initiative and developed into the IPC Program by 2009 with creation of the Indian Health Care Model. The program hosts improvement collaboratives for foundational learning and structured improvement activities to facilitate local achievement of the PCMH benchmarks.<br />The online familiarization training of healthcare improvement concepts in the Improving Patient Care context will be used as an introduction to the program for new employees and as a means of advertising within the organization to increase awareness and drive demand for participation in the program. Additionally, the training will be incorporated into the formal training curriculum for fundamental learning as a bridge from the familiarization training, and as a structural outline for the formal curriculum. <br />The customer service training will establish a baseline standard for customer service in IHS facilities while also standardizing the training across the entire Service. Many Area Directors have requested a standardized curriculum for customer service training as well as an accessible online source for all of the Areas. Training costs have been a barrier in the past to acquiring training so providing an online resource to all of IHS at no local cost will eliminate that barrier. Also, sources of training have varied geographically and by cost, so no standard curriculum has been delivered resulting in many varied practices across the Service.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INFORMATION<br />In order to respond to this notice, interested firms should address the depth and breadth of in-house professional and technical capabilities, and must be able to clearly convey its experience and/or ability to perform in the following areas, which are identified as core services. <br />1) online-accessible to all Indian Health Service employees (Federal, Tribal, and Urban) brief learning modules providing familiarization with core concepts of healthcare quality improvement methodologies defined by the Indian Health Service IPC Program.

<p>INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, "Longitudinal Studies for Age-Associated Conditions in a Sardinia Population Cohort (SardiNIA4)". The SardiNIA4 project is a continued need of the SardiNIA study under Contract No. HHSN271201100005C encompassing an additional follow-up period to carry out fifth visits for the maximum number of participants that are possible. The primary study will facilitate the achievement of three major goals of the longitudinal study. First, with a fifth visit, the data become accurate enough to correct for measurement noise ("Type 1 error") and determine the trajectory (rate of change) of traits. This will permit corresponding analyses of genetic factors that affect changes as well as absolute levels of traits such as blood pressure. Second, the Outcome Study reaches the point where the genetic risk factors inferred for traits can be assessed for diagnostic and prognostic value for aging-related conditions and diseases. Third, newly added measures, as specified in the Tasks, will add scope to analyses of the effects of genetic factors on aging. The AIMS include:</p>
<p>AIM I: Performance of all data collection activities for Tasks 1-5 (A-C) herein this SOW;</p>
<p>AIM II: Performance of data entry, verification, editing, transmittal and file management contained in Tasks 1-5 (D-G); and</p>
<p>AIM III: Participation in the preparation of publications and public presentations on the results of the study, and design the studies to maintain expansion for additional phenotypes and longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>In keeping with its overall mission, it is incumbent on the NIA to discriminate epidemiological and genetic factors involved in the etiology of aging-associated deficits, in order to understand and intervene to prevent or alleviate them. Examining the genetics of aging-associated conditions such as cardiovascular problems and osteoporosis is especially difficult because 1) they are "late-onset" conditions, affecting older individuals; and 2) they are "complex traits", with a number of genes contributing more or less to tipping the balance toward a phenotype or disease in one or another person. As one aid to analyses, attention has increasingly focused on the promise of "founder populations" that arise from a delimited group living in a defined region, in this case, Sardinia, for many centuries with minimal admixture from outside populations. The high degree of relatedness in such a population helps in modern non-parametric analyses to localize and refine the localization of those genes. The Sardinian population is one of the few that is both numerous and accessible enough, and one of the most extreme in its relative homogeneity. The attractiveness of Sardinia for study is increased by the concentration on an especially isolated cluster of four (4) towns in east-central Sardinia, Ogliastra, for the core studies; and in addition, for targeted case: control studies, the entire island population of 1,500,000 provides a recruitment base for a wide range of diseases.</p>
<p>The program examines phenotypes for which NIA expertise and test instruments are well developed, and which represent important aging-related conditions. The study has been scoring &gt;200 dichotomized traits (smoking, etc.) and over 300 quantitative traits ("endophenotypes" or "quantitative risk-related genetic or environmental factors") that can be scored on a continuous scale. The traits of particular interest include a range of cardiovascular risk factors; kidney and lung function tests; anthropometric measurements; blood test values; and facets of personality and cognition. <br /><br />The primary SardiNIA study has been ongoing since June 15, 2001. This study has recruited over 7,000 subjects and measured the traits for each subject. Genotyping and genome sequencing of all participants was also completed that has provided the data for investigators to look for genetic factors associated with each trait. We note that the advantages of the inter-related population have included the ability to sequence the genomes of 2,000 individuals at relatively low coverage and impute the results on the genomes of 5,000 other family members who had been genotyped inexpensively with a framework set of markers. Thus, we recovered the genomic sequence information for &gt;7,000 individuals for an investment that, using conventional whole genome sequencing strategies, would have allowed deep sequencing of only 160-180 genomes. The infrastructure for the clinic and phenotypic testing has been stable, with stringent quality control, and the data are of correspondingly high quality.</p>
<p>The sample cohort numbers (ages 22-102) absorb over 60% of the population of the towns, organized into over 1,000 families who are all locally born. This sample is large enough and interrelated enough to infer highly significant estimates of genetic heritability for traits, with the bulk of genetic diversity seen across Europe along with millions of DNA variants that are rare or non-existent elsewhere but have increased to relatively high levels on the island; another advantage for genetic studies. With this cohort, repeated visits to the testing center for repeated tests and additional tests, including bone-density and frailty measures, echocardiography, and blood pressure variability, have been done. Fourth visits will be completed within the tenure of SardiNIA3.<br /><br />The SardiNIA4 contract envisages a study for 5 additional years. A critical step in longitudinal studies would record data from a fifth visit of participants (AIM I); and transfer of the data (AIM II) would provide them for later use in a range of studies. A subsidiary Aim III would be to design the studies to maintain an expansion to study additional phenotypes. The study is designed to permit the estimation of individual trajectories of quantitative traits, which requires the measure of at least five points in time to deal with "noisy" traits like blood pressure and avoid the bias resulting from "regression to the mean".</p>
<p>Based on the proposed studies, the information recovered could facilitate ulterior analyses of age-related trends and the molecular nature of gene variations that are significant factors for traits of particular interest, and stabilize a platform for the possible extension of studies to other phenotypes and further longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>SCOPE AND REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The specific objective is to extend the longitudinal study of trends in quantitative trait values with a fifth clinic visit for the participants in the study. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordination of the data collection, including recruitment and scheduling of study participants, administration and scoring of tests for each trait and data entry and transfer. The Contractor shall provide maintenance of equipment; provide personnel, supervising their performance in the administration and scoring of the tests; and be responsible for computer entry and data transfer of the test data to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The Contractor shall continue the data acquisition for the additional years with an assured intent for continuity of Contractor leadership and staff.</p>
<p>In addition, the Contractor shall be responsible for properly protecting all information used, gathered, or developed as a result of the Statement of Work (SOW). The Contractor shall establish and implement appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive Government information, data, and/or equipment.<br /><br />The following are three goals to satisfy NIA's objective fully:</p>
<p>I. Determine values for the specified range of phenotypes, including specified new traits, in the established cohort from the founder population of Sardinia, completing a fourth visit for as many of the 7,000+ recruited participants as possible for the required tasks.</p>
<p>II. Provide the data (values) for all traits in electronic form and reports as specified, in order to support derived analyses and publications.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in May.
<p><br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects. The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'. Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register. Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />The Open Period for May is May 1, 2015 to May 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement. The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements. Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov). Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website. During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through FY 2015 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2014, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2015 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. ** You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>
<p>OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within the following boundaries: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Westchester County, Nassau County, or Suffolk County.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM: Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>The USACE Wilmington District is contemplating a solicitation for improvements at Eagle Island Dike, in Wilmington, North Carolina. Features of the project include expansion of the existing dike base (step-in), dike raising, ditching, and spillway system modifications.  The dike step-in will be constructed to the inside of the existing Cell 2 and Cell 3 dikes.  The step-in will serve as the base for the dike raise which will increase the existing top of dike elevation which is at approximately 39' to a top elevation of 43' at the Cell 2 and Cell 3 perimeter dikes and the cross dikes.  The Cell 1 dike will be topped off with an approximate 2' raise to bring it to elevation 42'.  Excavation of a portion of the existing Cell 2 and Cell 3 dikes will be required for placement of geotextile.  The interior of disposal Cell 2 will be ditched in order to drain and dry the material.  Spillway modifications will include relocating the spillway riser boxes clear of the new dike step-in footprint and extending spillway pipes.  Borrow material for the dike step-ins and dike raises will be available within the interior of Cell 2 and Cell 3.  Potential contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) to be eligible for award. Potential contractors must also have current Online Representations and Certification Application on file with SAM. (See website https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM). The magnitude of this project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. <br> This proposed contract is being considered as a set-aside under a small-business set-aside program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 237990, with a size standard of $36,500,000.00. The Government requests that interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size (i.e. annual revenues and employee size), anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the Prime Contractor and work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information when determining it's small business set-aside decision. Information and any questions regarding this sources sought synopsis can be sent to carol.b.jayroe@usace.army.mil. The closing date for responding to this sources sought synopsis will be May 08, 2015.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -<br />HEALTH AND USAGE MONITORING SYSTEM (HUMS) <br />FOR USCG HC-144A AIRCRAFT<br />HSCG38-15-S-010005
<p>Background</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) operates eighteen (18) HC-144A aircraft. The HC-144A is manufactured by Airbus Military (formerly EADS CASA) based in Seville, Spain. The base CASA CN-235M aircraft provides the foundation for the HC-144A. Changes to the base aircraft configuration and the addition of supplementary systems have been combined resulting in a CG01 version of the CN-235M, the USCG HC-144A Maritime Patrol Aircraft.</p>
<p>The aircraft is not currently equipped with any type of permanently installed vibration analysis monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a Request For Information (RFI) only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of potential permanently installed engine and propeller monitoring and balancing equipment options for the HC-144A.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The USCG requests information from sources to provide technical and performance data for a Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS). The proposed HUMS shall be available by a commercial source and be sustainable for the next twenty (20) years. To meet the requirements of the HUMS, the system must be capable of engine vibration monitoring and propeller vibration analysis. The system should be able to record the data collected and allow for easy data review. Data acquisition equipment should be able to indicate an out of balance propeller, compute balance corrections, and recommend corrections. The system shall be capable of collecting data throughout all ground and flight profiles.</p>
<p>The information obtained will be used to determine the benefits of installing HUMS on the entire fleet of aircraft.</p>
<p>Responders should provide the following:<br />Technical data, to include input/output <br />Efficiency<br />Operating parameters<br />Size and weight <br />Method of securing<br />Mean Time Between Failure data<br />Availability<br />Sustainability requirements<br />Data review methods<br />Number of collection channels for accelerometers<br />Number of collection channels for magnetic pickups <br />Number of collection channels for strain/stress gauges</p>
<p>Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with this RFI. All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential and will not be returned. Additionally, the Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) Medium Range Surveillance (MRS) Product Line encourages potential respondents to give presentations, provide their solutions, or gather feedback at our facility.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to provide information for the additional following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified hub zone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, provide POCs for civilian users for general usage of product questions.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the USCG still plans to proceed with an acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunity website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the USCG to award any contract.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI shall be emailed to CWO Kevin Musorofiti, MRS Division at Kevin.Musorofiti@uscg.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received no later than June 30, 2015, 4:00pm Eastern.</p>

<a href="mailto:tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil">ACC-RSA - (Missile)</a>
<DESC> <br> I.	Overview of Funding Opportunity: <br>  <br> The US Army Aviation & Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors capable of utilizing new and innovative technologies to satisfy Government requirements to advance the capabilities in research, development and testing of navigation systems and components with application to Army Long Range Missile Systems and Air/Missile Defense Systems. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is focused on developing advanced navigation system and component technologies and integration techniques that are affordable and will assure precise navigation in Global Positioning System (GPS) challenged environments for target engagements from 30 to 499 km. <br>  <br> Due to technology transition objectives, proposals are requested from offerors that have capabilities in research, development, fabrication, integration and testing of missile navigation system technologies along with the experience and capabilities to produce navigation components and systems for high performance long range ground-to-ground and ground-to-air missile applications. <br>  <br> Proposals will be evaluated only if they are for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state of the art or increasing knowledge and understanding. Proposals focused on specific devices or components are beyond the scope of this BAA. <br>  <br> Proposals are expected to be for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries that would have a significant impact on enabling new and improved Army operational capabilities and related technologies. The specific research areas and topics of interest described in this document should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting. The AMRDEC is interested in considering new innovative research concepts of relevance to the Army.  <br>  <br> Upon receipt, a concept paper will be evaluated by a team of Government technical experts. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. Offerors whose concept papers receive a favorable evaluation will likely be encouraged to prepare a complete proposal in accordance with instructions contained in this BAA. More detailed information regarding the evaluation process is detailed in Section IV. <br>  <br> The cost of concept paper and/or complete proposal preparation in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract or award.  <br>  <br> II.	Specific Areas of Technical Interest <br>  <br> Proposals with new and innovative technologies are requested which could enhance the state-of-the-art and scientific knowledge for the technical areas listed below. These technologies are needed to support the engagement of targets at extended ranges (out to 499 km) under all conditions and are critical to enabling the U.S. Army to provide long range ground-to-ground based missiles in a GPS degraded/denied environment that counters enemy anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) advantages.  <br>  <br> (1) Inertial Navigation Technology - High performance navigation grade inertial navigation sensors are currently too large and costly to support the objectives of the future long range missile programs. The current and future missile programs within the Army have requirements for minimizing Cost, Size, Weight and Power (CSWaP). This program is focused on developing highly accurate, low cost inertial sensors for precision navigation in GPS degraded environments while minimizing CSWaP. <br>  <br> (2) Vision-based Navigation Technology - Vision based navigation technology has been limited to demonstrations on aircraft and land vehicles. The application of vision based navigation to long range missiles systems is currently unproven. The ability to track objects, perform georegistration, and to generate optical flow measurements from a high dynamic, high temperature, high altitude missile is extremely challenging. Advancements in high temperature optics, and sensors are required for long range missile systems to enable precision navigation for missile systems operating in GPS degraded or denied environments. <br>  <br> (3) Celestial Sensors - Historically celestial sensors require very large and costly optical components and stabilized platforms in order to provide precision navigation solutions. These conventional designs are not suited for the low- CSWaP demands of current missile systems. Advancements are needed in developing low cost strapdown optical sensors and algorithms capable of providing precision navigation for missile systems operating in GPS degraded or denied environments. <br>  <br> (4) Integration Architectures - Conventional navigation focuses on adding one or two sensors in addition to GPS to form an integrated navigation system. Advancements in system architecture design and navigation filtering algorithms are required to enable the use multiple sensors such as laser altimeters, cameras, magnetometers, and Radio Frequency (RF) seekers develop a robust navigation in all operational environments.  <br>  <br> (5) Other potential sensors and navigation aids that will be considered for long range missile application, which may include terrain mapping, signals of opportunity, robust GPS (including Anti-Jam technologies), network assisted navigation and pseudolites. <br>  <br> III.	Concept Paper Submission Instructions <br>  <br> Prospective proposers are requested to submit concept papers prior to the submission of a complete, more detailed proposal.  Concept papers may be submitted at any time during the one year period that this BAA is in effect.  The purpose of concept papers is to minimize the labor and cost associated with the production of detailed proposals that have very little chance of being selected for funding. Based on assessment of the concept papers, feedback may be provided to the proposers to encourage them to submit full proposals. Concept papers should present the effort in sufficient detail to allow evaluation of the concept's technical merit and its potential contributions of the effort to the Army mission.  <br>  <br> The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the AMRDEC.  Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offeror's past performance on Government contracts.  <br>  <br> The concept paper shall be limited to 10 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced, 12 pt Times New Roman font), of English text and illustrations, as necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Office POC, Ms. Tammy J. Benson, via e-mail at tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Janet Childers, via e-mail at janet.f.childers.civ@mail.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal.  <br>  <br> IV.	Concept Paper Evaluation  <br>  <br> A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria detailed below. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 120 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. <br>  <br> Evaluation Criteria:  <br>  <br> Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated using the factors listed below:  <br>  <br> a. The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal.  <br>  <br> b. The potential contributions of the effort to the mission of the AMRDEC.   <br>  <br> c. The offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these, which could allow for transition of developed technologies.  <br>  <br> e. The offeror's record of past performance.  <br>  <br> f. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fee.  <br>  <br> g. Availability of funds. <br>  <br> V.	Contract Proposal <br>  <br> THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED.  <br>  <br> THE CONTRACTING OFFICE WILL ASK ONLY THOSE OFFERORS WITH PROMISING CONCEPT PAPERS TO SUBMIT FULL TECHNICAL AND COST PROPOSALS. The Government will provide SELECTED offerors with proposal content requirements. <br>  <br> Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contracts are expected to be awarded, with the period of performance for each IDIQ contract estimated to be no less than 12 months and to not exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $20M range for the total value of each IDIQ contract.  <br>  <br> Proposals should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level, with the exception of Canadian companies.  <br>  <br> The technical proposal shall contain a maximum of 25 pages. The cost proposal has no page limit, but a cost summary page should be included as part of the proposal.  Generally, proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to:  <br>  <br> (1) Performance Work Statement (PWS): The PWS should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement, or end product to be developed. The PWS should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the advancement of tactical missile navigation technology. The PWS should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables.  <br>  <br> (2) One page resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. <br>  <br> (3) The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. <br>  <br> (4) A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. <br>  <br> (5) A brief description of your organization. <br>  <br> (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal. <br>  <br> (7) A listing of current similar R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical) shall be included. <br>  <br> The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for each year of the program to show the following: <br>  <br> (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project.

Fiscal Year 2015 subcontracting goals for small business are 35%, for veteran owned small business 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 5%, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (Hubzone) small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCUs/MIs)) 3%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted. The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past experience shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.  <br>  <br> This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one year from date of posting. Email your questions to Tammy J. Benson, Contracting Office POC, at tammy.j.benson.civ@mail.mil. Contracting Office Address: US Army Contracting Command-Redstone, ATTN: CCAM-RDB, Building 5400, Fowler Road, Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This request for information is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bid, Request for Proposal, Solicitation, and Request for Quote, or an indication that the Government will contract for the items in this RFI. The Government does not intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this RFI. Any responses received will not be considered nor used as a proposal. <br />The Department of Homeland Security and specifically the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) is requesting market research information in order to identify potential sources that can supply a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) solution to develop, publish, and manage a mobile application. This FLETC seeks to improve the student experience by providing a convenient source of aggregated information useful to the student such as a campus map, student handbook, and recreation schedule. This will reduce time spent looking for the information from individual sources and potentially reduce time, effort, and costs for printing documents such as the student handbook. The government prefers an HTML5 mobile web application but with the option of deploying a native application later. Vendors should provide a COTS solution. The FLETC desires an "end to end " turn-key solution including professional services to develop and design the app, a convenient console or interface to manage content once deployed, and support.<br />The FLETC requests the following information from potential sources:<br />&bull; Company name, Duns number, street address and point of contact with phone number and email address.<br />&bull; Is your company registered in the System for award Management (SAMS) which is the official US Government system for contractors?<br />&bull; If you have a current GSA contract for Commercial Wireless Internet Services, please provide the GSA Schedule Number and the SIC code that apply.<br />&bull; Provide a brief capability statement (not to exceed 10 pages excluding brochures, pamphlets, catalogs and website information) that individually addresses the requirements stated in the attached Requirements document and the information discussed in paragraph 2 of this RFI.<br />&bull; What is your socioeconomic status? (see attached small business definition sheet)<br />&bull; Do you currently have contracts with other government agencies (to include federal, state and local) for mobile applications. Please provide the Agency name and point of contact information and contract number if possible.<br />&bull; Please provide publically available price lists for mobile applications to include warranty terms and costs for maintenance/support beyond the initial warranty period.<br />&bull; Identify and explain the experience you have in developing mobile applications for Universities or learning institutions. Include contact information for those entities you have worked with.<br />&bull; If standard pricing list exists for the COTS solution please provide information.
<p>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. There is no guarantee that the Government will pursue a solicitation for any of the requirements identified herein. All information received in response to this RFI will NOT BE RETURNED. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>All information must be directed to Mr. Douglas Marshall, Contracting Officer via email: douglas.marshall@fletc.dhs.gov or by facsimile to (912) 267-3132. Responses to this RFI must be submitted via email no later than May 8, 2015 at 3:00 PM eastern standard time.</p>

<p>(10) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation. <br />(a) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>

<p>(4) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(11) Contract award. The Air Force intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. The offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. If the Air Force opens discussions, the competitive range may include proposals rated as "Unacceptable" at the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The Air Force may make a final determination as to whether an Offeror's proposal is acceptable or unacceptable solely on the basis of the initial proposal. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(12) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number.

The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(13) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the CCR database accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Please provide your proposal in two sections: Section I, Technical and Section II, Price, Section II Past Performance. <br />The technical evaluation sub-factors are below. An offeror's technical proposal must be acceptable in all factor areas in order to receive an overall "Acceptable" technical rating. A single "Unacceptable" rating for any of the technical sub-factors will result in an "Unacceptable" technical rating, and is considered unawardable. The order of importance of the technical sub-factors is considered equal.</p>
<p>Sub-factor A: SERVICES REQUESTED<br />The offeror's proposal clearly describes the processes, procedures and tools, that will be used to meet requirements of PWS Tasks 3.1, 3.2 including expanded descriptions in Attachment 1 PEX System Administration and Attachment UL/UC2 Ops System Administration.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describe Turn-Around-Time IAW PWS 3.3.2 in a way that demonstrates the offeror understands the performance threshold defined in the Service Summary (PWS 5.0 Item 1)</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describes the processes and procedures, that will be used to ensure system administrators meet and maintain DoD 8570.01-M requirements, PWS 3.2.2 b and required skill to support windows server system administration including virtual machine environment, PWS 3.2.2d</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describes how Up-time (Operational Availability) will be tracked and managed for individual outages to ensure PWS thresholds are met (See PWS 3.3.2.3b for Up-time requirement, 5.3 - Service Summary Performance Thresholds, item 7).</p>
<p>Sub-factor B: Program Management<br />The offeror's proposal clearly describes the corporate and site specific management concept, organizational structure, and use of a Quality Control plan (PWS 4.2) to execute daily operations and maintenance services at supported sites.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describes the approach required for management of travel requirement defined under PWS 8.4 and billing process stated under PWS 3.3.3.2</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describes the approach required for material purchases as stated in PWS 7.2 required to ensure repairs and up-time, 3.3.6, how materials will be invoiced as defined under 3.3.3.1, how materials will be reported/tracked as defined under 4.1.2. <br />The offeror's proposal clearly describes the approach to hire qualified core FTE workforce, PWS 3.1.2, 3.2.2 and 7.3, at required locations, PWS 8.1.1, to perform day one. Show understanding of qualification requirements and process to establish a FTE at required locations</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal clearly describes the approach to maintain performance thresholds (PWS 5.3 Services Summary Table) during periods of manning fluctuations (i.e. attrition, vacation or illness) for locations of performance (PWS 8.1.1).</p>
<p>***Sub-factor C: Transition Planning<br />The offeror's proposal clearly describes a phase-in transition plan that meets the requirements of PWS 10.1.</p>
<p>(b) Limit your Technical Section to no more than 15 pages.</p>
<p>(c). To provide for an easy evaluation, the Technical Section shall be specific, detailed and complete to clearly and fully demonstrate that Offerors have a thorough understanding of the requirement. The proposal must clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation. Statements that Offerors understand, can, or will comply with the PWS (including referenced documents, etc.); statements paraphrasing the PWS or phrases such as "standard procedures will be employed" or "well know techniques will be used" or "work will continue as it has in the past" will be considered "Unacceptable" For the technical section to be considered acceptable, offerors' must clearly address each evaluation factor under the technical evaluation adequately. Any item not adequately addressed could be found unacceptable..</p>
<p>(d) Options. Clause 52.217-8 will be included in the final contract. This clause allows for continued performance of any services within the time limits and rates specified in the contract. Therefore each offeror must price a six month option period by a monthly amount. It is anticipated that 52.217-8 will be used to extend the contract anywhere from one to six months at the end of the initial 12-month period. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for the entire six month option to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of the option shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>Price Evaluation Factor:<br />The Price evaluation is expected to be based on adequate price competition. However, if necessary, the evaluation team reserves the right to use any proposal analysis technique in FAR Par 15.404-1 to ensure the contract is issued at a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>Please follow the outline CLIN structure contained within the attached pricing spreadsheet. This is provided as a guide to help develop your pricing proposal. The spreadsheet has built-in formulas to sub-total and summarize each offeror's price. As the contractor, simply enter the monthly price from your supporting price proposal into the "Line Item Price" column for each CLIN. It is the intended CLIN structure for the contract. The estimated annual cost of cost-reimbursement line items (Travel and Material/Software Purchase) is identified by the Government and will be applied to all offers received. An offeror may not change the ceiling price, and no handling fees or profit may be applied. All pricing must be on a Firm Fixed Price basis as a monthly amount.</p>
<p>NOTE: There is great expectation of competition for this requirement: thus offerors are cautioned to present their best price proposal up-front. The offeror's price proposal shall represent the offeror's best effort to respond to the solicitation. In instances where an offeror receives an acceptable technical rating, yet proposed prices appear exceptionally low, offerors may be requested to address this disparity, providing evidence of their capability and/or experience providing similar service(s) at similar price(s). An exceptionally or unrealistically low offer may pose an unacceptable risk to the Government and may be a reason to reject an offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>As noted, the six month option price (Clause 52.217-8) will be added to the total and be evaluated as part of the Total Overall Evaluated Price (TOEP).<br />There is no page limit for the Price Section.<br />Past Performance:<br />Past performance will be evaluated based on responsibility analysis in accordance with FAR 9.103. The standards contained within FAR 9.104-1, including having a record of satisfactory performance record and integrity and business ethics, serve as the guidelines for this determination. The offeror must be determined responsible to receive the contract.<br />Please provide up to three (3) samples of relevant past performance with Point of Contact/Telephone Number. <br />(End of provision)</p>

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<p>Factor 1- Technical capability - The Government will evaluate the quoters technical submission to determine compliance with the Performance Work Statement. The technical submissions will be rated as either "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable". Acceptable is defined as meeting the government's requirements and Unacceptable is defined as not meet the government's requirement's.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

However, you may also file a protest to the Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.   <br>  Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command   <br>  Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel   <br>  4400 Martin Road   <br>  Rm: A6SE040.001   <br>  Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000   <br>  Fax: (256) 450-8840 or email usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil   <br>  The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/amc/commandcounsel.html.   <br>  If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the HQ AMC-Level Protest Procedures.   <br>  (End of Clause)  <br>  SCHEDULE OF INSURANCE:   <br>  a. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance period of this contract at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required below:   <br>  Workmen's Compensation and Employer's Liability Insurance $100,000.00   <br>  General Liability Insurance for Bodily Injury Liability:   <br>  Minimum Per Occurrence $500,000.00   <br>  Automobile Liability Insurance:   <br>  Minimum Per Person $200,000.00   <br>  Minimum Per Occurrence for Bodily Injury $500,000.00   <br>  Minimum Per Occurrence for Property Damage $ 20,000.00   <br>  b. Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall certify to the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained.  The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective (1) for such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed or prescribed (2) until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor give written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.   <br>  c. The Contractor shall insert the substance of the clause entitled Insurance - Work on a Government Installation (FAR 52.228-5), in subcontracts under this contract that requires work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required above.  <br>    <br>  Service Contract Act Wage Determination 05-2187, Revision 15, dated 22 December 2014, is applicable to this procurement.   <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>  BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD:   <br>  Source selection for this procurement will be conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.602, Streamlined Evaluation of Quotations, and FAR Part 13.106-2, Evaluation of Quotations or quotations.  For a quoter's submission to be determined Technically Acceptable and receive consideration for award based upon lowest price submitted, the quotation must receive a rating of Acceptable for both Technical Acceptability and Past Performance.  The Government will award the contract to the quoter that meets all the evaluation criteria with a Acceptability rating, and has the lowest price.  Trade-offs between cost/price and non-cost/price factors will not be permitted.   <br>  As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the quoter's final option period price to the quoter's total price. Quoters are required only to price the base and option periods.  Quoters shall not submit a price for the potential six-month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period.  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for an quoter to be considered for award.  Those quoters not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.   <br>  In the event of an unacceptable Past Performance evaluation rating for an otherwise Technically Acceptable low price quoter, the Small Business Administration (SBA) will be contacted for a Certificate of Competency (COC) determination in accordance with procedures in FAR 19.601.  In the event a quoter receives a rating of Unacceptable for both the Technical Acceptability Factor and Past Performance Factor, a COC determination will not be requested as the quoter would remain Unacceptable based on the evaluation of the Technical Acceptability Factor.   <br>  Discussions or Negotiations: The quoter's initial quotation should contain its best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  Discussions, if any, will be conducted in accordance with FAR 12.602 and final quotations will be evaluated in accordance with factors as were initial quotations.   <br>  Award for All of the Work: The Government intends minimum of one (1) contract(s) as a result of this solicitation; however, the Government may make multiple awards.  Each Schedule will be evaluated separately and awarding the most advantageous quotation for each Schedule.  Schedule B includes CLINs 0002, 1002, 2002; Schedule C includes CLIN 0003, 1003, 2003.  Schedule D includes CLIN 0004, 1004, 2004.  Therefore, quoters may submit quotes for one, all or any combination of the Schedules.  When submitting an offer for a Schedule, quoters must complete the associated Price List for the Line Items associated with that Schedule in order to be considered for award.  An incomplete Price List may cause the Quoter to be considered ineligible for award of the corresponding Schedule/Line Items.  For example if an offer intends to submit a quote for Schedule B; the Bid Schedule and the Price Lists for CLINs 0001, 1001, and 2001 shall all be completed and submitted in their applicable sections.  <br>  Evaluation Criteria.   <br>  (1) Evaluation criteria consist of factors and elements as listed below.  Quotations will be evaluated under three (3) evaluation factors:   <br>  Factor I: Technical Capability   <br>  1. Acceptability Standard 1: Management Approach   <br>  Factor II: Past Performance   <br>  Performance evaluation will assess the relative risks associated with a quoter's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance.  In evaluating Past Performance, Quality of Services, Timeliness of Performance, and Business Relations will be evaluated.   <br>  Factor III: Price   <br>    <br>  Factor I: Technical Acceptability: The Technical Acceptability Factor evaluation provides an assessment of the quoter's capability to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.   <br>  Acceptability Standard 1: Management Approach - Must demonstrate a thorough knowledge and understanding of how to fulfill the Government's requirement through the illustration of management approach.  Approach shall include approach to scheduling, timely performance, ability to supervise and manage a team of people to include subcontractors, and a detailed execution plan showing labor hours, and equipment.  <br>  The Technical Acceptability Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below. The individual standards will not receive an adjectival rating.   <br>  Table 1.  Technical Acceptable/Unacceptable Ratings   <br>  Rating Description   <br>  Acceptable Quotation clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>  Unacceptable Quotation does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.   <br>    <br>  (2) Factor II: Past Performance: The quoter shall submit a list of recent and relevant past contracts/subcontracts as defined below.  The past performance evaluation will assess the quoter's probability of meeting the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that quoter's record of past performance.  Past Performance is assessed at the factor level after evaluating aspects of the quoter's recent past performance and focusing on past performance that is relevant to the services being procured under this solicitation.  Quoters are cautioned that in conducting the performance risk assessment, the Government may use data provided in the quoter's submission and data obtained from other sources, such as the Contractor Past Performance Reporting System (CPARS), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or similar systems and State Department Watch Lists.   <br>  There is no minimum or maximum number of references required; however, the quoter shall submit sufficient past performance information to demonstrate the depth and breadth to successfully satisfy all areas of the proposed effort.  It is incumbent upon the contractor to present the past performance information in such a manner and in sufficient detail to ensure the Government clearly understands the information provided.   <br>  Each quoter will receive a past performance rating of acceptable or unacceptable based on the Quoter's recent past performance, focusing on performance that is relevant to the contract requirements.   <br>  Recency Assessment: An assessment of the past performance information will be made to determine if it is recent.  To be recent, the effort must be ongoing or must have been performed during the past three (3) years from the date of issuance of this solicitation.  Past performance information that fails this condition will not be evaluated.   <br>  Relevancy Assessment: To be relevant, the effort must be similar in nature of work, size, and complexity.  The Government will conduct an in depth evaluation of all recent performance information obtained to determine if it is the same or similar in nature, size, and complexity to the services being procured under this solicitation.  A relevancy determination of the quoter's (including joint venture partner(s) and major and critical subcontractor(s)) past performance will be made.  In determining relevancy for individual contracts, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the quoter, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated.  In establishing what is relevant for the acquisition, consideration should be given to what aspects of a quoter's contract history would give the most confidence that the quoter will satisfy the current procurement.  The past performance information provided in the quotation and obtained from other sources will be used to establish the relevancy of past performance.   <br>  The Past Performance Evaluation Team will review past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to past performance rating.   <br>  The Past Performance Factor will receive one (1) of the adjectival ratings defined below.   <br>  Table 2: Past Performance Evaluation Ratings   <br>  Rating Description   <br>  Acceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown.   <br>  Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.   <br>  Quoters without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  Therefore, the quoter shall be determined to have unknown past performance.  In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, Unknown shall be considered acceptable.   <br>  (3) Factor III: Price: The Price factor will not be scored or rated.  Evaluation of price will be performed using one or more price analysis techniques in FAR 13.106-2.  Through these techniques the Government will determine whether prices are reasonable, complete and balanced.   <br>  Options.  Pricing submitted for the Quoter Schedule, will be evaluated for price reasonableness. The Government will evaluate the Quoter's total price, to include the base period, first option period, second option period, and one-half of the second option period, using price analysis techniques (See FAR Clause 52.217-8).  Pricing must be provided for all line items in order for a quoter to be considered for award.  Those quoters not providing pricing for all line items will be removed from consideration for award.  The Government will award a single contract to the quoter whose quotation represents the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quotation.   <br>  Unbalanced Pricing.  Unbalanced pricing may be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(g), as applicable, to assess potential performance risk which could result in unreasonably high prices.   <br>  Quotations are due no later than 27 April 2015, 4:00 PM CST.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which will be considered by the agency.  In accordance with 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, paragraph (f), quotes received after the established closing date will be viewed as late, and therefore not considered.  Quotations may be submitted via email (preferred) to matthew.e.wernert.mil@mail.mil or via mail to MICC - Fort Campbell, ATTN: MAJ Matthew Wernert, 6923 38th and Desert Storm Ave, Fort Campbell, KY 42223-5355.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI launched the C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire Transition Initiative (CITI) program in September 2011, four months after the end of post-election violence. The contested presidential election of November 28, 2010 was a part of the 2007 Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which outlined steps towards reunifying the country which had been divided between a government-controlled south and a rebel-controlled north. Instead of ensuring C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire's transition to a stable and democratic country, the contested elections provoked violence and resulted in three thousand people losing their lives, hundreds of thousands being displaced, and an already tense social and political environment throughout the region becoming more inflamed.</p>
<p>Significant progress has been made towards economic recovery and political stability since the 2011 electoral crisis. Since assuming the presidency in May 2011, Alassane Ouattara has promoted economic growth, extended state authority and services across the country, and overseen relatively peaceful legislative and local elections in 2012 and 2013, respectively. However, the underlying causes of the crisis have only been partially addressed, allowing community divisions to deepen and political tensions to simmer. Since 1990, elections have been major sources of instability and violence in Cote d'Ivoire. The Presidential elections in 2015 could emerge as an incendiary flashpoint, bringing to the fore unresolved issues such as nationality/citizenship, ethnicity, land tenure and impunity that were at the heart of the crisis and remain impediments to a successful post transition period. There is concern that these issues could be exploited particularly at the community level to disrupt the electoral process, undermine the gains made during the recovery period, and impede progress towards consolidating and achieving additional political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Given these issues, the second phase of OTI's Cote d'Ivoire Transition Initiatives (CITI) program, CITI 2, focuses on increasing community cohesion and resilience and providing support to the 2015 electoral process with a view towards local-level issues. Taking advantage of key partnerships with local government institutions and non-governmental organizations, and utilizing OTI's ability to rapidly design and implement activities through its small-grant mechanism, CITI 2 concentrates on grassroots solutions to potential flashpoint issues while continuing to strengthen relationships across and within communities. OTI's programming aims to increase voter access to information and participation in the elections, with the overall goal to further consolidate social cohesion and political stability through an inclusive and credible electoral process.<br />The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the DCHA/OTI Africa Regional Team and will be based in Abidjan, C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire along with the OTI Country Representative. The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is supporting the Country Representative in the development, oversight and management of the C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire country program. Working closely with the implementing partner staff, the Deputy Country Representative assists in the design and development of grant activities, program implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the DCHA/OTI Country Representative or his/her designee, the Deputy Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices, U.S. Government agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and grant concepts and work with diverse groups, many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to monitor and assess political conditions, implementing partner operational platforms, meet with potential grantees, host government and other program counterparts, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor and train OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as Acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions including budget preparation, financial management, records management, and travel assistance, to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Coordinate with the OTI Country Representative to develop an exit strategy that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the U.S. Embassy, bilateral donors, United Nations organizations, international organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation, 2) OTI contractor performance, 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale, 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other U.S. Government entities, 5) security concerns, 6) relations with local partners including local, state and national government representatives, and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the FSN staff, including program officers, administrative assistants and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel, program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will be supervised by the OTI Country Representative or his/her designee in the country of assignment. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will set overall objectives and resources available, and work with the employee to develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The employee will be responsible for planning and carrying out assignments, resolving most conflicts, coordinating with others, and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives. Keeping the supervisor informed of progress, the employee may determine the approach to be taken and the methodology to be used. The supervisor will review completed work from an overall standpoint of feasibility, compatibility with other work, or effectiveness in meeting requirements.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>While in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, the work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. However, the position also requires travel throughout the country of assignment, which may involve some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p>ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years.

<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. The Government is seeking information from all sources regarding a potential contract to procure a Gantry Crane capable of moving concrete target blocks with a minimum weight of 1.7M pounds (850 short tons) and minimum varying dimensions of 25'x25'x17' to 40'x40'x 7' at the 96th Test Group, 846 Test Squadron, located at Holloman AFB, NM. Respondents will not be notified of the responses to this RFI. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, this notice is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations. Information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary" or "Confidential" will not be disclosed outside of Government channels. While a final decision has not been determined, the North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is preliminarily set as 333923, Overhead Traveling Crane, Hoist, and Monorail System Manufacturing. A set-aside determination has not been made, but is being considered. The Product and Services Code (PSC) is 3950, Winches, Hoists, Cranes, and Derricks.</p>
<p>SECTION 1 - BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The 96th Test Group at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, is a unit of the 96th Test Wing, Eglin AFB FL. As part of the 96 TG, the Holloman High Speed Test Track (HHSTT) conducts impact tests to evaluate performance, survivability and lethality of weapon systems. Large concrete targets are manufactured near the impact area of the track and moved into place using a gantry crane. The current gantry crane used to move targets into position is limited to 160 tons constraining the maximum target size to 22'x22'x4'. Providing larger, monolithic targets would enable more realistic target configurations. A gantry crane capable of moving a minimum weight of 1.7M pounds (850 short tons) would provide the opportunity to test against 25'x25'x17' or 40'x40'x 7' target blocks.</p>
<p>SECTION 2 - PURPOSE OF RFI:</p>
<p>This notice is issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources capable of meeting the 846th Test Squadron's requirements. The Government intends to use information gathered from industry to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support the formulation of an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>SECTION 3 - SCOPE OVERVIEW:</p>
<p>The crane shall be capable of lifting and placing targets upto 40 feet high and 40 feet wide with a minimum weight of 1.7M pounds (850 short tons). The crane shall be capable of providing a minimum of 18 inches of clearance between the bottom of the target and the ground. <br /><br />The crane shall be capable of lifting and moving targets from the assembly area to the placement location. The targets will need to be moved over a packed uneven soil surface. The crane shall be capable of placing multiple blocks against each other in the target area. The crane shall be capable of moving targets across terrain with up to a 5 degree slope.</p>
<p>The contractor will need to have the capability to deliver, assemble and train HHSTT personnel on proper use and maintenance of the crane at Holloman AFB NM. The contractor will be required to bring all items necessary for assembly of the crane. The contractor may be requested to design the lifting hardware needed to tilt up and carry the targets. The contractor may be asked to recommend appropriate lifting devices capable of handling the target. <br /><br />SECTION 4 - RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to submit a capability statement not to exceed 20 pages in length including any pictures, diagrams and other materials. If submitted electronically, all responses must be provided in a Microsoft Office or Adobe format. Physical submissions must include original plus two (2) copies.<br />Capability statements should include as a minimum:<br />Company Name, Address, <br />POC with Phone Number and E-mail Address, <br />DUNS Number and CAGE Code<br />Business size based on NAICS 333923; Size Standard: 500 Employees<br />Any supporting information regarding ability to meet the general requirements listed above.<br />Identify whether the items are considered commercial items</p>

The four major topic areas of research interest include the following:  (1) Training; (2) Leader Development; (3) Team and Inter-Organizational Performance in Complex Environments; and (4) Solider/Personnel Issues.         <br>              <br>     Funding of research and development (R&D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle.  Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Part II Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the R&D warrants further inquiry.  If the R&D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a proposal will be entertained.  The recommended three-step sequence is (1) telephone call to the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) full proposal submission.  Awards may be made in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.         <br>              <br>     Proposals are sought from educational institutions, non-profit/not-for-profit organizations, and commercial organizations, domestic or foreign, for research and development (R&D) in those areas specified in Part II Section A of this BAA.  The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences encourages Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Other Minority Serving Institutions (HBCU/MI) (FAR Part 26.3) small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses (FAR Part 19) to submit proposals for consideration.  Foreign owned, controlled, or influenced organizations are advised that security restrictions may apply that could preclude their participation in these efforts.  Government laboratories, Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and US Service Academies are not eligible to participate as prime contractors or recipients.  However, they may be able to participate as subcontractors or subrecipients (eligibility will be determined on a case by case basis).         <br>              <br>              <br>     This BAA may be accessed from the following websites:        <br>              <br>     https://www.fbo.gov         <br>              <br>     http://www.grants.gov       <br>              <br>              <br>              <br>              <br>              <br>                <br>

<DESC>The US Army, Project Manager, Apache Attack Helicopter, is issuing this sources sought synopsis as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in, and the resources to support, the requirement for a fire detection system (ability to geo-locate fired munitions including small through large caliber, RPG, MANPADS, missiles, etc.) for the AH-64E.  The fire detection system shall be a 360-degree surveillance system that uses any or a combination of acoustics, infrared (longwave, shortwave, or midwave), and/or radio frequency, to locate enemy shooters for more accurate return fire.  Potential solutions may utilize existing Army systems as part of the GFAD solution.  Multi-use sensors, to include sensor fusion, should be considered for future growth opportunities.  The sensor system shall detect line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight hostile fire and classify these as small arms through large caliber, RPG, MANPADS, missiles, etc.  The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement and the scope of this initial development effort.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 336413.  <br>    <br>  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME.  This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.    <br>    <br>  If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information:  1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, DUNS number, CAGE code, and size and type of ownership for the organization; 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of performance, organizational, and staff capability; 3) Information paper (not to exceed 20 pages) detailing potential solution/s to satisfy this requirement and the qualification status and technology readiness level (IAW  quote mark Technology Readiness Level Assessment Guidance, quote mark  dated April 2011) of the proposed system/s.

<DESC><br />INDUSTRY DAY NOTICE - OPEN TO BOTH SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES<br /><br />DESCRIPTION: <br />U.S Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), Upper Colorado Region, Albuquerque Area Office Industry Day for the Design-Build Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System (PBRWS). <br /><br />WHEN: <br />Wednesday, May 6, 2015 (10:00 am - 5:00 pm) - Thursday, May 7, 2015 (8:30 am - 12:00 pm) <br /><br />MEETING LOCATION: <br />Cities of Gold Hotel, 10-A Cities of Gold Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 87506. <br />The Cities of Gold Casino &amp; Hotel is located 15 scenic miles north of Santa Fe, New Mexico on US 84/285. <br /><br />PURPOSE: <br />Reclamation is hosting an Industry Day to exchange information on the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System (PBRWS) Design Build (DB) project. This Industry Day will include a presentation on the project background, a site tour, a question and answer session, private contractor sessions, and the opportunity to meet with Program/Project Managers, Contracting Officers, Contract Specialists, and key players from Reclamation. The intent of the Industry Day is to provide advance information about the project to industry and obtain feedback to assist Reclamation. Questions that will be proposed to industry during this forum include: <br />1. The proposed acquisition schedule (see attached): In this two-phase evaluation process, the three best qualified firms will be requested to submit proposals. The proposals shall include drawings of the complete PBRWS and all its elements sufficient to price construction and to meet the requirement of the authorizing legislation to complete final designs within 90 days of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the environmental impact statement. Elements of the PBRWS that are common to all alternatives include the transmission and distribution pipelines, water treatment plant location, locations of pumping plants, and locations for 8 of the 10 new water distribution tanks. While the general location of the intake structure in known, the type of intake system will not be determined until the ROD is signed. Both surface water and infiltration options are under consideration. The final location for 2 of the water distribution tanks in the Bishop's Lodge Extension may not be known until the ROD is signed. Does the proposed schedule provide an appropriate length of time for preparing drawings and drafting a technical and cost proposal for known PBRWS elements prior to the ROD being signed? Can the remaining drawings and proposal elements for a fixed price DB contract be finalized and submitted within 30 days of the ROD being signed and therefore all PBRWS elements are known?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The Pojoaque Basin contains many cultural resources. The means and methods for minimizing adverse impacts to these resources will be documented in memoranda of agreement between Reclamation, the four Settlement Pueblos, the New Mexico State Historic Preservation Office and Santa Fe County. What are your thoughts on including cultural resource mitigation/protection requirements as part of the DB contract? What would be the preferred method for pricing this work (e.g. maximum dollar allowance, percentage of project, cost reimbursement)?</p>
<p><br />3. How much time should be allowed after commissioning and acceptance testing for training the eventual operators and maintainers of the Intake System and Water Treatment Plant?</p>
<p><br />4. What are the issues, concerns, benefits, and risks of utilizing a DB contract for the entire project versus utilizing a DB contract for the initial phase (intake, raw water supply, water treatment plant, and initial phase of transmission and distribution systems) then utilizing Design-Bid-Build for the remaining portions of the transmission and distribution system? What is your preference?</p>
<p><br />5. What type of contract works best for a design/build contract (Firm-Fixed Price, Cost Plus Fee, Cost Plus with Guaranteed Maximum Price, etc)?</p>
<p><br />6. What type of contract incentives are most effective?</p>
<p><br />7. Will Reclamation have the opportunity to participate in the value engineering process for the designs?</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENT: <br />On December 8, 2010, the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-291) was signed into law. Title VI of the Act authorizes Reclamation to plan, design and construct the PBRWS consistent with the Pojoaque Regional Water System Engineering Report prepared by HKM Engineering, dated September 2008 (Engineering Report). The PBRWS will consist of diversion works, storage, a treatment plant, pipelines and pumping plants, and other facilities necessary to divert up to 4,000 acre-feet of water for consumptive use by the Pueblos of Namb&eacute;, Pojoaque, Tesuque, and San Ildefonso (four Settlement Pueblos) and Santa Fe County. The Act establishes several deadlines, including: (1) issuance of final project designs within 90 days of completion of environmental compliance (Act &sect;611(b)), and (2) completion of the PBRWS by June 30, 2024. A critical requirement of the PBRWS is that it be able to provide a firm, reliable supply of treated drinking water to the residents of the Pojoaque Basin. Unlike many municipal water systems, the PBRWS does not have multiple sources of water supply. This system will rely solely on water from the Rio Grande to meet demand. For more information about this project, see www.PojoaqueBasinEIS.com <br /><br />WHO SHOULD ATTEND? <br />&bull; Contractors who provide construction, construction services, architectural/engineering services, engineering services.</p>

According to the market research conducted, the requested items are available under the Army DOD Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) agreement.  CHESS on behalf of the DoD ESI Program, IBM Consolidated Products BPA, has awarded a new IBM On-Ramp Blanket Purchase Agreement to provide IBM Software product licenses and maintenance to DoD agencies and their support contractors, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Intelligence Community. The BPA was awarded competitively against GSA schedule. Therefore, the vendors who fall under this BPA are the only ones allowed to submit a quote. <BR> <BR>The IBM Passport Advantage (PPA) site # = 0003150712. <BR> <BR>

CHESS on behalf of the DoD ESI Program, IBM Consolidated Products BPA, has awarded a new IBM On-Ramp Blanket Purchase Agreement to provide IBM Software product licenses and maintenance to DoD agencies and their support contractors, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Intelligence Community. The BPA was awarded competitively against GSA schedule. Therefore, the vendors who fall under this BPA are the only ones allowed to submit a quote. <BR> <BR>The IBM Passport Advantage (PPA) site # = 0003150712. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The following announcement has been amended to include the following paragraph:


The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 333924 for Forklift Manufacturing and Pallet Movers Manufacturing with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  A wholesale trade or retail trade business submitting a quote for this requirement is categorized as a non-manufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of 13 CFR 121.406. Vendors must complete the attached Business Declaration Form and return with quote submittal.



The following questions and answers are provided for this requirement:

1.	Will a sit-down model forklift work?

No, the FAA requires a stand-up forklift.

2.	What fork length do you require? 42" long? 48" long?  60" long? Or longer? 

  48 forks for the electric lift.  The Telehandler fork length would be determined by what is required to safely handle the requested work platform.  

3.	Do you require a side-shifter (to shift both forks left or right hydraulically from the operator's seat) OR a side-shifting fork positioner (to shift both forks left or right hydraulically from the operator's seat AND be able to spread the forks out as wide as the carriage or bring the forks very close together until they almost touch)? 

The indoor electric lift only needs left/right carriage shifting.  The Telehandler requires both.

4.	 Do you require a flashing strobe light?

Yes, an amber flashing beacon is required on both pieces of equipment.



The following requirement is set-aside for Small Business Concerns.

The FAA is hereby soliciting quotes for the following:

The FAA Airport Technology Research and Development Branch has a requirement for an indoor forklift (quantity 1) and a telehandler (quantity 1).  The specifications for the equipment are below:

-	Electric drive stand up style lift
-	Lift capacity of at least 2,000 lbs.
-	Reach height of at least 15 ft.

Telehandler:
-	Diesel engine with minimum 99HP
-	Minimum 300 lbs.  ft. of torque
-	Four wheel drive capability
-	Three steering modes (2 wheel, 4 wheel and crab)
-	Minimum 40 ft. lift height
-	Lift capacity of 10,000 lbs. or greater
-	Lift capacity of 2,700 lbs. or greater at maximum reach with outriggers deployed

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice: <br />Indian Health Service Online Familiarization Training<br /><br />INTRODUCTION
<p>This is&nbsp;small business&nbsp;Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified sources; (2) whether they are other than small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Improving Patient Care (IPC) Program of the Indian Health Service resides within the Office of Clinical and Preventive Services and was developed to train healthcare facility care teams in the Model for Improvement within a context of the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model. The program began in 2007 as the Chronic Care Initiative and developed into the IPC Program by 2009 with creation of the Indian Health Care Model. The program hosts improvement collaboratives for foundational learning and structured improvement activities to facilitate local achievement of the PCMH benchmarks.<br />The online familiarization training of healthcare improvement concepts in the Improving Patient Care context will be used as an introduction to the program for new employees and as a means of advertising within the organization to increase awareness and drive demand for participation in the program. Additionally, the training will be incorporated into the formal training curriculum for fundamental learning as a bridge from the familiarization training, and as a structural outline for the formal curriculum. <br />The customer service training will establish a baseline standard for customer service in IHS facilities while also standardizing the training across the entire Service. Many Area Directors have requested a standardized curriculum for customer service training as well as an accessible online source for all of the Areas. Training costs have been a barrier in the past to acquiring training so providing an online resource to all of IHS at no local cost will eliminate that barrier. Also, sources of training have varied geographically and by cost, so no standard curriculum has been delivered resulting in many varied practices across the Service.</p>
<p>RESPONSE INFORMATION<br />In order to respond to this notice, interested firms should address the depth and breadth of in-house professional and technical capabilities, and must be able to clearly convey its experience and/or ability to perform in the following areas, which are identified as core services. <br />1) online-accessible to all Indian Health Service employees (Federal, Tribal, and Urban) brief learning modules providing familiarization with core concepts of healthcare quality improvement methodologies defined by the Indian Health Service IPC Program. The modules should not exceed 10 minutes time to view video/multi-media materials each. The modules must convey cultural sensitivity to a predominantly American Indian employee audience. The modules must portray care delivery in Indian Health Service facilities. The website and modules must incorporate American Indian thematic elements in a culturally sensitive manner. <br />2) online-accessible to all Indian Health Service employees (Federal, Tribal, and Urban) brief learning modules providing standardized customer service training (as relates to improving the quality of and experience of care in Indian Health Service facilities) with verifiable completion, competency testing, and administrative reporting functions. Each training module/lesson should not exceed 15 minutes time to view video/multi-media materials each. The modules must convey cultural sensitivity to a predominantly American Indian employee audience. The modules must portray care delivery in Indian Health Service facilities.

<DESC>AMENDMENT<br /><br />The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the draft RFP documents being released with this special notice. Although the draft Statement of Objectives references 10 appendices, (C-1 through C-10), please note certain ones have been omitted from this release. For example C-2&nbsp;Service Level Agreement for Radio Access Network (RAN) Integration&nbsp;and C-10&nbsp;FirstNet Cyber Hardness Requirements&nbsp;have been not been included in this special notice as these documents are still being developed in consultation with states, tribes, territories, public safety stakeholders, and market participants, and may be provided at a later date or in a subsequent RFP. Some of the feedback obtained as a result of this notice may provide additional information in order to make a determination regarding the disposition pertaining to these additional appendices.<br />

<DESC>Department of State 2015 Construction for<br />US Embassy Prague, Czech Republic
<p>Request for Information - Market Research</p>
<p>AMENDMENT SECTION 3.A. has been removed from this document.&nbsp; PLEASE SEE BELOW.<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) as outlined in FAR 15.201(c) (7). The purpose of this RFI is to accomplish market research pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, and to identify businesses capable of performing the functions described herein. The government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting firms to support the requirements of THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) for the Prague, Czech Republic. The project will consist of construction services to construct a Compound Security Upgrade on the campus of the U.S. Embassy Prague, Czech Republic.</p>
<p>This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment on the part of the government to conduct a solicitation for the below-listed services in the future. Responders are advised that the government will not pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, nor will it compensate responders for any costs incurred in the development/furnishing of a response. <br />Please note that a decision not to submit a response to this RFI will not preclude a vendor from participating in any future solicitation.<br />1. Project Description (Secret Facility and Personnel Security Clearances NOT Required)</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy is housed in the Schoenborn Palace, within the central historic city core, at Tri&scaron;t&#283; 15, 118 01 Praha 1 - Mal&aacute; Strana, Czech Republic. The 10,735 m 2 (11,5551 ft 2) building is a four story masonry structure with basement built between c. 1600 and 1769, acquired by the USG in 1925. The Chancery and Gardens located in a UNESCO World Heritage Area and are Cultural Monuments protected under Czech Law.<br /><br />The project will consist of the construction of Security Upgrades at the Embassy Complex. Construction scope may include: historic perimeter wall replacement and repair, perimeter security fence replacement, a new access pavilion, surface parking, site lighting, a new pedestrian entrance, interior improvements, replacement and relocation of an electrical transformer, main electrical service room and equipment, and back-up generator. The project will require work in historically sensitive areas and will include some restoration of historic finishes. Work on such finishes and the reconstruction of the perimeter wall will require engagement of locally certified craftsmen able to perform the work in the manner required by Czech Heritage Authorities.</p>
<p>Approximate construction cost: $9 - 14 million.</p>
<p><br />2. Project Solicitation:</p>
<p>The project solicitation will consist of two phases.</p>
<p>Phase I - Pre-Qualification of Offerors<br />This announcement of solicitation of pre-qualification submissions is Phase I. DOS will evaluate the pre-qualification submissions based on the evaluation criteria set forth below.</p>
<p>The Government may conduct an information session for interested Offerors prior to the receipt of pre-qualification submissions. A separate announcement will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities webpage (www.FBO.gov) to specify the location, date, and time.</p>
<p>Phase II - Requests for Proposals from Pre-Qualified Offerors</p>
<p>Those Offerors determined to be pre-qualified in accordance with this notice will be issued a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the project and invited to participate in a site visit and submit technical and pricing proposals in Phase II. Phase II proposals will provide pricing for the construction.</p>
<p>The contract will be "firm fixed-price." Construction services will include providing construction labor and materials to execute the design; on-site organization with management to ensure overall project coordination; and overall control throughout the life of the project. Required services include preparation of construction documents, quality control plans, safety plans, project schedules and project close-out activities.</p>
<p>The Phase I pre-qualified Offerors will be required to participate in a visit to the project site, anticipated to be within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the Phase II RFP.</p>
<p><br />3. Prior Pre-Qualification: - NOT APPLICABLE<br />Complete prequalification package submission required.</p>
<p><br />Detailed Instructions</p>
<p>Submission Requirements for Phase I, Pre-Qualification of Offerors: The Offeror shall submit sufficient documentation to allow DOS to evaluate its capabilities with the qualification criteria listed. Submissions that are missing the required information or otherwise do not comply with the submission requirements may be eliminated from consideration at the Contracting Officer's determination.</p>
<p>Copies. Provide one original plus one copy in printed form, and one electronic copy in PDF format on compact disc. PDF shall be identical to the printed version and book marked by section, if applicable. DOS may review either the electronic or the printed submittal; therefore, both formats shall be complete and identical to each other.</p>
<p>To demonstrate performance of similar construction work for Percy Amendment purposes, offerors will need to provide information demonstrating that it has successfully completed in the United States or at a U.S. diplomatic or consular mission a construction contract or subcontract involving work of the same general type and complexity as the solicited project and having a contract or subcontract value of at least 35% of the low-end estimated value of the solicited project ($3,150,000.00). The value of the work provided to demonstrate successful completion of work of the same general type and complexity as the subject project will not be adjusted for inflation or any other market forces.</p>
<p>3.A. SECTION REMOVED<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE: Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related firms, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture (where the arrangement among the co-venturers has been reduced to writing), or "de facto" joint venture (where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. person firm that guarantees performance). To be considered a "qualified United States joint venture person," every joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. The U.S. person co-venturer will be required to sign a guarantee making the U.S person individually responsible for performance of any contract awarded, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.</p>

<p>Factor 2a(1): Critical attributes (must include all requested information to be fully considered. This factor may be satisfied with 3 or more projects. Each project need not be responsive to every sub-factor. When considering the project dollar value, only the Offeror's contractual amount will be considered (e.g. the Offeror's project value on a $100M job where they were a subcontractor for $20M of work shall be considered for the purposes of this evaluation as a $20M project.</p>
