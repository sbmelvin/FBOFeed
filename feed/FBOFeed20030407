This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) because NASA/GRC has a requirement for a Trade Study on Dual Microstructure Heat Treat Technology (DMHT). These recent advanced heat treat techniques will allow designers of gas turbine aircraft engines to utilize superalloy disks with a dual grain structure, i.e. coarse grain rim and fine grain bore. The flexibility afforded by DMHT technology could allow enhanced creep resistance in the rim while maintaining high strength levels in the bore. This procurement is for a 6 (six) month effort to study this issue. The study will be competed among gas turbine aircraft engine companies only. A gas turbine aircraft engine will be selected to compare DMHT technology with current heat treat technology, i.e. subsolvus or supersolvus solution heat treatment, for nickel-base turbine disks. At least 2 (two) dramatically different disk designs will be evaluated. An example of this choice might be commercial versus military engine or small versus large engine. At a minimum, the study shall include the effects compressor discharge temperature, T3, and the location of the transition zone on performance, safety, and cost. Estimated material properties to be used in this study will be provided by NASA, if desired. The Contractor will be required to issue a NASA Contractor Report covering this effort. Upon completion of the 6 month effort, NASA may elect to fund a second phase starting in Fiscal Year 2004, to continue a more detailed design of DMHT disk technology based on results of the initial study. A May 1, 2003 award date is anticipated. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-12.

<SUBJECT>B--Mapping and Characterization of Recurring Spring Leads and Landfast Ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas
<SOLNBR>71707
<RESPDATE>042803
<ARCHDATE>04062004
<CONTACT>Anna M. Brown Contract Specialist 7037871369     Anna.Brown@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service (MMS) of the Department of the Interior intends to competitively award a contract to conduct a study that provides MMS with the spatial and temporal analysis of recurring spring leads and landfast ice conditions within the project study area. The name of the new study is titled "Mapping and Characterization of Recurring Spring Leads and Landfast ice in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas" The project area will encompass the eastern Chukchi Sea, southwest of Barrow, Alaska and the Beaufort Sea as far east as the Mackenzie River Delta System. The approximate geographic boundary includes that area between 1620 and 1340 west longitude with the approximate northern boundary at 730 north latitude. BACKGROUND: The first objective of this study is to provide critical information on spatial and temporal extent of recurring spring lead systems which can be incorporated into the MMS Oil Spill Risk Assessment (OSRA) model.  The current output from the MMS OSRA model provides critical information on potential impacts on wildlife from spilled oil.  The lead systems within the Beaufort and Chukchi seas can be important biologically since they may concentrate wildlife. These lead systems are used as a corridor for the spring migration of the Bowhead Whale, other marine mammals, and waterfowl.  Birds migrate through the Arctic in spring often use polynyas as their first feeding areas.  Many large bird colonies are located near these important food sources.  The interaction of ice is the key to how much localized biota is at risk to spilled oil that is encapsulated in pack ice.  Risk from encapsulated oil would be less if the ice pack diverges along the lead lines as opposed to breaking up and crossing the leads that may concentrate wildlife. The second objective is to determine the spatial and temporal changes in landfast ice conditions within the Beaufort Sea.  Landfast ice conditions in the Beaufort Sea are also an important input parameter for the MMS OSRA model.  The seaward limit of stable landfast ice defines where under-ice pooling of spilled oil might take place and where landfast ice conditions apply to design and operation of offshore facilities: MMS requires gridded outputs from statistically analysis of multiple years of either SAR RADARSAT, ERS-1, AVHRR or other imagery used to measure the spatial and temporal extent of leads and landfast.  The statistical output from many years of raw imagery data will provide critical input for the MMS OSRA Model. Spatially georeferenced gridded data sets compatible with ESRI ARCGIS 8,3x and FGDC compliant metadata shall be provided to MMS for the recurring lead systems. The analyzed gridded data from the raw satellite imagery will show the statistical reoccurrence of spring lead systems over time. Similarly, ARCGIS compatible gridded and georeferenced data sets are required for landfast ice conditions. For landfast ice, consistent methodology using high resolution satellite imagery over a long period of time is needed to statistically define the monthly change in landfast ice conditions within the Beaufort Sea.  A final report shall describe the raw data used for the study, in addition the methods used to synthesize and analyze the data. The final report shall provide detailed information on the physical processes associated with the development of landfast ice and recurring spring leads within the study area. The results will be used in MMS' evaluation of potential effects of OCS exploration and development in the Beaufort Sea OCS Region as needed for future EA and EIS analyses.  In addition, the OSRA model will utilize the results of the study to assess the effects of spilled oil on wildlife. The MMS anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursement contract with an estimated price of between $350,000 and $395,000.  The period of performance is two years (24 months).  PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  SCOPE OF WORK: The Contractor shall be required to (Task 1) Review and synthesize literature, local information, and data sources into a Procite Database for spring lead systems and landfast ice in the Eastern Chukchi, southwest of Barrow, Alaska and the Beaufort Sea between Barrow, Alaska and the Mackenzie River Delta (A) Research and compile into a Procite bibliographic database those references that pertain to the mapping of recurring spring leads and landfast ice within the Beaufort Sea.  (B) Obtain permission and catalogue pertinent images of spring leads and landfast ice taken by AVHRR, RADARSAT, ERS, SAR or other imagery that can be used to analyze the Spring lead and landfast ice conditions in the eastern Chukchi  Sea, southwest of Barrow and the Beaufort Sea to the Mackenzie River Delta.  (C)Obtain digital tapes of suitable images and permission to use imagery for the stated purpose.  The contractor must document how they are going to obtain the necessary satellite imagery. We are currently in negotiation with the National Ice Center (NIC) to provide the contractor access at minimal cost to the RADARSAT imagery within their current archives from 1999-2003.  There is no guarantee that this agreement will be approved by the NIC.  We suggest that the contractor write-up a budget that includes and excludes access to the NIC archived data.  If the NIC agrees to share their data and the contractor agrees to utilize the NIC archived data, the contractor must sign a user agreement with the NIC and agree to abide by all of the rules and stipulations as stated within their agreement. (Task 2) Synthesize and analyze current and historical remote-sensing imagery of recurring spring leads and shoreward landfast ice line. (A)Synthesize current and historical RADARSAT, ERS, SAR AVHRR imagery and determine the best coverage's over the maximum number of years. We are looking for approximately 5- 10 years of data and trend verification with older imagery. (B)Analyze the most suitable data that provides the spatial and temporal definition of the recurring Spring Leads and landfast ice. (Task 3) Provide ARCGIS gridded output summarizing the spatial and temporal distribution of reoccurring spring leads in the Alaskan Beaufort Sea. (A)  Provide ARCGIS grids and metadata of individual years as well as statistical representation of lead occurrence and distribution over multiple years. (Task 4) Provide ARCGIS gridded output and metadata showing the monthly distribution of landfast ice line across the Alaskan Beaufort Sea to the Canadian Mackenzie Delta. (A)Provide individual months per year as well as statistical representation of landfast ice occurrence and distribution (B)Provide relevant attributes with the spatial data. (Task 5) Provide a final report that includes a discussion on the development of the spring lead system and land fast ice within the study area (A)Include a detailed synthesis of the information collected and the methods used to analyze the data to obtain the requested results.(B)Briefly describe any observed trends that appear in the development of the spring leads or landfast ice conditions, and postulate explanatory factors.(C)Provide representative colored images that display typical examples of the spatial and temporal change of the recurring spring lead system and landfast ice growth and melting through time.(D)All references shall be included within the Procite Database(E)Provide a spreadsheet that catalogues the images and image quality used for the analysis. Project Deliverables shall include: Procite bibliographic database, ESRI ARCGIS gridded output and ESRI ARCGIS metadata, draft and final reports with technical summary and NTIS documentation.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 334516. The US ARMY ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ has a requirement need for a high-tech camera system capable of locating markers in a given field and relaying its exact location and storing the data into a format that can be retrieved for analysis.  This system will be outfitting the new Target Behavioral Response Laboratory building for the purpose of recording data from experiments.This video monitoring system is capable of tracking movements of subjects with markers in specified area to generate 3-dimensional positioning data that can be recorded and saved for simulation, testing and evaluating purposes.  It uses 1.3 millions pixel cameras with a frame rate capability of 1000 frames per second (capture rate) to send out strobes of either visible or infra-red light which are refracted from markers and sent back to the cameras.  The system uses all the data to calculate a very accurate position location of each marker (up to millimeter accuracy).  The lack of ambient light will not affect the data retrieval process at all.  A great application for this system is tracking various subjects during an experiment to record and observe their movement and behaviors.  The total purchase will include 24 cameras with data stations, a software package, software and hardware support, on-site installation and optimization, on-site training, as well as supporting equipment such as superclamps, wall brackets, and heavy-duty tripods. Camera system must include 20mm lenses; data station with 24 active video channels in shock mounted flight case; 100Mbit Ethernet connection;  serial external event ports; remote trigger port; Break Out Boxes (BOB)  including data station to BOB cables; integrated kinematic software package with data capture; automatic linearization, reconstruction, and labeling; pipeline and batch processing; Pop-Up graphing; sample-skip capability; GSI/2 Photogrammetry; plug in API; Synchronized integrated movie capture; software controlled video switch; allows for batch post-processing of heavily-occluded data; fully automated data editing; graphical template construction module; multimedia report authoring; and integrated and hyperlinked report authoring. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13. A single award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer is determined to be the best value to the Government based on Technical, Past Performance and Price. To be determined to be technically acceptable the offeror must furnish detailed product literature that clearly shows the product offered meets all requirements stated in the specifications. The offer will be determined to be technically acceptable based on in house technical evaluation. For Past Performance, Offerors shall furnish three references of sales made for same or technically comparable systems which are currently in the warranty periods (i.e., within the past year) and three references of prior sales for same or technically-comparable systems currently beyond the warranty periods (i.e., over a year ago). FAR provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items applies with addendum to Para (b)(5): Offers shall provide a warranty which at a minimum shall be for five (5) years covering parts and labor from the date of installation of the complete system.

Offers shall be submitted on official company letterhead and include a CAGE code and DUNS number. Offers shall be received at the contracting office no later than 4 PM EST 25 April         2003. Offers should be submitted via E-mail to, eczekaj@pica.army.mil (or rmcminn@pica.army.mil ) Via fax (973-724-6542), or mail. The contracting office is not responsible for incomplete, late, lost, misdirected or postage-due mail or for any technical malfunction,  lost/delayed data transmission, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, or line failure in connection with any telephone network, computer equipment, software or any combination thereof. Award shall be made to the offerer whose proposal represents the best value to the Government. Technical, Price Risk and Past Performance shall be subjectively compared to determine the combination that is most advantageous to the Government and an award shall be made on that basis.

<DESC>The National Science Foundation intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for management and staffing of the Science and Technology Policy Institute in support of Office of Science and Technology Policy in accordance with requirements delineated below.          MANDATE AND GOVERNANCE          As reflected in U.S. Code: Title 42 USC §6686 (herein referred to as “the Act’), Congress mandated the establishment of a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to be known as the Science and Technology Policy Institute (hereinafter in this document referred to as “the Institute”).  The Institute was established to assist the Executive Branch as it formulates federal policy involving science and technology by providing objective, high quality analytic support to inform policymakers.  The Act specified the duties of the Institute as follows:  Assemble timely and authoritative information regarding significant science and technology developments and trends in the United States and abroad.  Analyze and interpret the information referred to above, with particular attention to the scope and content of the Federal science and technology R&D portfolio as it affects interagency and national issues.  Conduct studies and analyses of alternatives available for ensuring the long-term strength of the U.S. in the development and application of science and technology, including appropriate roles for the Federal Government and other sectors.  Provide, upon request of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), technical support and assistance for the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) and to committees and panels of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).  Consult widely with representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions and incorporate, to the extent practicable, information and perspectives derived from such consultations in carrying out its work.  Please see FAR 35.017 “Federally Funded Research and Development Centers”, for qualification and policy regulations, http://www.arnet.gov/far/.          SPONSORS’ CONCEPT OF THE INSTITUTE          NSF and OSTP  (hereinafter referred to as “the Sponsors”) conceive that the Institute will operate as follows:     *  While NSF is the primary sponsor of the Institute, OSTP should be viewed as its primary customer. In general OSTP will provide technical direction and oversight while NSF will provide business, financial and contractual oversight.     *  The Institute shall meet special research and analysis needs of is sponsors, whether short-term or long-term that cannot be met as effectively by using existing in-house or normal contractor resources. The Institute shall provide its sponsors with a network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization.  The Institute shall inform its sponsors and other government policymakers through the objective, independent, and high quality analysis and assembly of information, in contrast to taking advocacy positions.      *  The Institute shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special long-term relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding their full confidence and trust.          MANAGEMENT PLAN          The organization that is awarded the contract to operate the Institute (hereinafter referred to as the “Contractor”) shall set up, provide the necessary space and equipment, support and technical personnel to establish and manage the Institute, as an FFRDC in accordance with the Sponsors’ concept for the Institute described above.  The Contractor, through the Institute, will be responsible for planning and executing such research and analysis as the Sponsors may specify.  Such research and analysis may include quick-response, ad-hoc analysis and technical support, short-term studies (up to one month), medium-term studies (1-6 months) and long-term studies (more than six months). The Contractor will also provide staff and technical support for the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (“PCAST”) and the National Science and Technology Council (“NSTC”), as deemed necessary.  Task areas may include but are not limited to:   *National Security    *Critical Infrastructure Protection   *Health and the Environment   *Space/Transportation   *Information/Telecommunication Infrastructure and Technology   *Education/Training   *R&D Portfolio, including emerging S&T issues   *PCAST and NSTC Support   *Development of New Analytic Methods and Tools     The Contractor will be responsible for hiring a certified public accounting firm to conduct: (1) annual financial audits of the operations of the Institute (and certify annual financial statements), and (2) all audits required either under OMB circulars or under the cost principles applicable to the Institute.          TASKS FOR OTHER THAN THE SPONSORS          It is not the Government’s intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.  However, an FFRDC may perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act, or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector.    This is allowable, provided:      * The task is consistent with the duties and responsibilities of the Institute as specified in the Act.   * The Institute has received the prior written approval of the Sponsors.    * Funding for the projects has been transferred from the funding agency or agencies to the NSF and added to the Institute contract.   * The Institute and the sponsoring agency or agencies agree to fully disclose all aspects of the work being performed, including draft documents, to the Sponsors upon request.          ELIGIBILITY QUALIFIERS          As specified in the Act, the Institute shall be: (1) administered as a separate entity by an organization currently managing another FFRDC. Qualified organizations must possess a broad interdisciplinary staff with backgrounds pertinent to the environment in which it is expected to operate.  Qualified organizations must be able to work effectively and in a timely manner with Federal organizations, institutions and personnel in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.     Oral communications and facsimile responses are not authorized, all questions must be submitted electronically to the National Science Foundation, Attn: Jamala A. Jones, Contracting Officer, Division of Acquisition and Cost Support, at jajones@nsf.gov by April 22, 2003.  Responses will be posted on April 30, 2003.  This is not a Request for Proposal; therefore no contract will be awarded resultant of this notice.  It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued on or about the end of May 2003 with a proposal due date on or about the beginning of July 2003.

<DESC>Sources are sought to identify firms capable of providing management, technical expertise, supervision, tools, equipment, supplies, labor and quality control necessary to provide data evaluation support services to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC), Reactor Products Program (RPP).   AFTAC/RPP provides national authorities with quality data analysis and technical evaluations on nuclear treaty compliance. The anticipated contract requires proficiency in nuclear engineering/physics, statistics, atmospheric modeling/analysis, and computer software design and maintenance.  Nuclear expertise supports data collection, analysis, quality assurance, and evaluation requirements. Atmospheric modeling expertise supports development and maintenance of a suite of government owned and commercial off-the-shelf atmospheric models. The majority of work is done off-site but some on-site support at Patrick AFB, FL will be required. Contractor presence in the local area is required to provide a responsive framework for adapting or modifying technologies to enhance mission effectiveness.

Nuclear data analysis begins with quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) throughout a radionuclide laboratory network. This includes checking data for trends and biases within and between laboratories and reporting findings via reports and meetings. The contractor will be required to employ industry accepted quality control techniques to analyze data from standard laboratory analysis of pay samples to include statistical analysis of mass spectrometry blind standards in order to provide an evaluation of laboratory performance and analytical studies to diagnose QA problems associated with laboratory processes or measurement techniques. Meteorological data support includes processing, preprocessing, visualization and other analysis techniques. Oracle database technology is used for both nuclear and meteorological databases. All models and analysis tools function in an integrated environment.

It is anticipated that the effort will involve elements of both Research and Development (R&D) and operational support.  R&D requirements will include: identifying evolving technologies in atmospheric transport and dispersion and nuclear engineering/physics disciplines; exploring and designing unique evaluation capabilities tailored to the RPP mission area; and, integrating all research efforts into the functional data evaluation system. The contractor will be required to maintain a configuration management (CM) program for effective development and maintenance of the RPP Data Evaluation System (DES). The CM will include the integration and updating of meteorological, statistical, data management, and other analytical tools in the RPP analysis and evaluation process. In addition, the contractor must identify, evaluate, design, develop, test, implement, and document approved changes for operational systems. 

Operational support will involve: The operation and maintenance of numerous in-house systems developed for AFTAC's unique mission. The complexity of supporting these systems requires the contractor to have, at a minimum, expertise in hardware and software CM and systems integration experience on SUN, SGI, NT, and LINUX Cluster architectures. Software expertise in Fortran (family), C (family), and Java languages is mandatory.

Responding parties should also indicate their size status in relation to the applicable NAICS Code, NAICS Code, 541330, Size Standard, $4,000,000.  Sources with 8(a) status or otherwise classified as a small disadvantaged business should address their status in their responses.


Contractor personnel will require DoD security clearances at least at the TOP SECRET/SCI level.  Handling of material up to TOP SECRET/SCI is required. Storage and Facility clearances of at least the TOP SECRET/SCI level are required.  This sources-sought synopsis is an invitation for all qualified sources that contemplate submitting a proposal under a future RFP for this requirement to identify themselves.  Sources should submit a brief capabilities statement in response to this notice.  Responses must be limited to no more that 10 pages and should address the following specific areas:

1.  The clearance level of personnel working on this contract.
2.  The experience and educational background of personnel relating to nuclear laboratory operations, atmospheric mesoscale modeling, atmospheric transport and dispersion modeling, metoerological datamining, statistics, nuclear physics/engineering, data acquisition,
3.  The experience and educational background of personnel in hardware configuration management and support and software engineering and graphical design and implementation.  
4.  Business size/status
5.  Specific relevant work completed or currently being performed to include description of the work and points of contact.

A cost plus fixed fee contract is contemplated with a 1 year basic period and four 1 year priced option periods.  This synopsis is for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract.  Responses may be mailed to 45CONS/LGCCB, Attn: James Loeffler, 1030 S. HWY A1A, Bldg 989, MS 1000, Patrick AFB, FL, 32925-3002.  Responses may also be e-mailed to james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil.

<DESC>THERE IS NO RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION NEEDED TO SUBMIT SF-254 AND SF-255 DOCUMENTS IS CONTAINED HEREIN.  Services include, but are not limited to the preparation of planning documents of various types normally used by the U.S. Navy, and technical services related to documents and software as may be requested by the Department of the Navy, PACNAVFACENGCOM.  The primary tasks anticipated for the Architect-Engineer (A-E), are the originating and the updating of planning studies and documents.  Additionally, the A-E may be assigned ancillary work to edit and rework incomplete or preliminary planning documents towards final completed products based on technical knowledge and skills gained by professional training and experience in the planning and maintenance of military and Government facilities and installations.  Planning documents, as referred to herein, include but are not limited to any document relating to Master Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, Regional Shore Infrastructure Planning (RSIP) Overview and Functional Studies, Special Planning Studies, Air Installations Compatible Use Zones (AICUZ) Studies, Land Use Studies, Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Studies, Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Studies, Military Training Studies, Space Studies (e.g., Administrative), Military Construction and Special Projects write-ups (normally on Department of Defense Standard Form 1391) with supporting documents (e.g., Cost Estimate, Site Plans, NEPA documentation, etc.), Engineering Evaluations (EEs), Facilities Requirements Plans (FRP), Basic Facility Requirement (BFR) justifications, Economic Analyses (EA), System Safety documents, Site Approval requests, Environmental Studies, Civil Engineering Support Plan, Land Inventory Analyses, studies, visual presentations, graphics, and/or any component or portion (not necessarily the entirety) of such documents.  The work will also include the production of planning documents and studies over the Navy's intranet, including the programming of associated software necessary to or incidental thereto.  Field verification survey work may also be an ancillary part of the planning process.  Any preparatory work, visual presentation, briefing, study, or report, which may be required prior to the initiation of any planning document listed, is also included under this scope.  Planning projects may include those for other U.S. Military Commands and Agencies (e.g., U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies) in the Pacific and Indian Ocean area, in addition to those of the U.S. Navy.  The A-E shall provide all professional services required for the completion of planning documents, including researching data, conducting site surveys, preparing, reviewing, and editing technical text and graphics to ensure completeness and correctness of documents.  When such services are required of the A-E for projects not wholly assigned to the A-E alone, the A-E must exercise professional judgment to verify the correctness and validity of the information, and the results and conclusions of the material the A-E is called upon to finalize.  The A-E must analyze, coordinate, correlate, synthesize, correct, supplement, and finalize the work assigned.  As an example of such an assignment, if the A-E is called upon to finalize the draft of a document or a particular graphic submitted by PACNAVFACENGCOM, the A-E shall rework such document or graphic until, in the A-E's judgment, the finished product is correct, complete, and reflective of the A-E's professional judgment and standards.  The A-E shall provide electronic deliverables for the publication of planning documents and the integration of source data used or generated during the planning process into the Regional Shore Infrastructure Plan (RSIP-Link) information system.  The primary purpose of the RSIP-Link System is to disseminate Regional Overview Plans, Functional Plans, and Other Studies/Documents to customer Activities via the Internet and to provide access to geospatial data through GIS interface.  All geospatial data shall conform to the RSIP-Link GIS Mapping Standards.  The Government utilizes the following software suite, which conforms to the approved Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) software suite:  Windows 2000 Workstation, Microsoft Office 2000 Professional Suite:  Word 2000, Powerpoint 2000, Excel 2000, Access 2000, Outlook 2000, Internet Explorer 5.5, Netscape Navigator 4.78, Adobe Acrobat 4.05C.  The Government utilizes AutoDesk’s AutoCAD 2002 as its CAD software.  In preparation of manuscripts, word processing files, desktop publishing documents, graphics and spreadsheets, the A-E shall ensure compatibility with the approved NMCI software suite.  Additional multi-media electronic software applications required, but not limited to, are: RSIP-Link, Dbase (dbf), Oracle 8.i, Auto Desk’s AutoCAD 2002 (DWG) or higher, Microstation 5.0, Visual Basic, Visual FoxPro, ArcView 3.2x or higher (SHP, SHX, SHB, DBF), ArcInfo Coverage Format, ArcSDE Format or as an ArcGIS geodatabase, and HTML screens.  The A-E shall also be responsible for training Government representatives on operation of the planning software and maintenance of data files.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within ten days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days from the meeting.  The contract will be an Indefinite Quantity type where the work will be required on an "as-needed" basis during the life of the contract providing the Government and contractor agree on the amount.  Each project will be a firm fixed-price task order.  The Government will determine the task order amount by using the rates negotiated for the basic contract and negotiate the effort required to perform the particular project.  The contract base period shall not exceed twelve months or $1,250,000 total fee, whichever comes first.  The Government guarantees a minimum amount of $25,000 for the contract.  Should an impasse on the price occur over the initial or subsequent projects, the Government will apply the dollar value of the Government estimate for that project or projects toward the minimum guarantee.  The Government reserves the option to extend the contract for an additional three option years, each with an maximum fee of $1,250,000 per year, for a total contract performance period of four years.  There will be no further synopsis in the event the options included in the contract are exercised.   Estimated date of contract award is on/about August 2003.

<DESC>EPA proposes to award a contract to SRI International, on a noncompetitive basis,  for the design, fabrication, and validation of a two-color field-usable Jet REMPI (resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization) instrument  for the detection of  tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (2,3,7,8-TCDD), any other halogenated dioxin or furan congener, as well as other toxic organic compounds.  The instrument will be designed for operation in a variety of environmental conditions, including ambient humidity and temperature levels. The instrument will also be designed to allow for the rapid replacement of components with limited operational lifetimes, such as the pulsed valve seals, as well as providing an easy means of exchanging the ion extraction optics and the pulsed gas valve as more sophisticated designs become available that will provide significantly enhanced performance. Additionally, the instrument will include the ability to rapidly switch between the detection of multiple compounds without operator intervention or adjustment.   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  An RFP will not be issued based on this synopsis. Any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Interested firms shall provide detailed information outlining their capabilities--any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded. Requests for a copy of the RFP will be disregarded. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Data Procurement Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  Proposal Submission PLace: Dr. Marlon Ramsses Tabora M, President, Comision Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CONATEL), Colonia Modelo, Apartado Postal 15012, Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. Honduras, Phone:  011-504-234-8622, Fax: 011-504-234-8611, email:  mtabora@conatel.hn.  
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to the national telecom regulatory agency, the Comisión Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CONATEL), in the area of telecom regulation.  

The project sponsor, CONATEL, is the public agency of Honduras responsible for the regulation of the telecom sector.  Originally created in 1991, CONATEL is responsible for implementing and applying both national official policy and international treaty obligations in the Honduran telecommunications sector.     

Under the new Maduro administration, Honduras is now beginning in earnest the process of opening its telecom sector to fuller competition, and correspondingly CONATEL is looking to develop a basic framework for the process.  Some of the key elements of this framework include: establishment of specific liberalization goals and objectives; evaluation of possible options; development of a Strategic and an Action Plan; review and proposed revision of the existing regulatory regime; assistance to the government in elaborating sectoral policy on competition; and institutional strengthening of CONATEL.  Additionally, CONATEL wishes to better understand how the experience gained in other countries under similar circumstances may be applicable (or not applicable) to the Honduran situation, and also wishes to ensure that the rural and marginal-urban segments of Honduras receive due attention under the new initiative.  CONATEL is seeking a focused TA team to assist it in developing and promoting this framework.  A well-executed TA would have a significant beneficial impact on the telecom marketplace by strengthening the existing legal/regulatory framework and promoting investment and development, in particular through encouraging new market entrants, increasing transparency, and creating a more “level playing field.”  

The CONATEL TA deals with telecom legal/regulatory issues of paramount importance, by reviewing the existing legal/regulatory framework, examining current practices, conducting a detailed analysis of the pertinent technical, economic and administrative issues, and developing feasible options, preferred alternatives, revised legal/regulatory instruments and recommendations for implementation.  The Consultant Team will be required to deal with a broad range of issues that are specific to Honduras, and must be able to interpret them in the context of relevant regional and worldwide practices and Best Practices.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following:

·	Task 1. Assessment of the Current Situation in the Telecom Sector
·	Task 2. Establishment of Objectives for Market Opening
·	Task 3. Evaluation of Options, including their Technical, Economic and Legal/Regulatory Implications, and the Attendant Risks and Benefits
·	Task 4. Development of a Strategic Plan for Market Opening
·	Task 5: Compatibility with Existing Legal/Regulatory Regime
·	Task 6: Draft of Sector Policy for Market Opening and Introduction of Competition
·	Task 7.  Implications for CONATEL and its Organization
·	Task 8. Draft and Final Report and Presentation of Findings

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $359,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Tegucigalpa, Honduras time, May 23, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified design-build general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities in Arizona District.  This area consists of the State of Arizona.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $1.0 million to $7.5 million, and are categorized as carrier annexes, postal retail facilities, delivery distribution centers, main post offices, stations or branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects. Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the Arizona District over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as design-build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified design/build firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review by the end of November of each year.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to gzipagan@email.usps.gov or nyoung@email.usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be emailed to the requestor.

The work to revetments may include grading; excavation; crushed stone blanket; riprap paving; stone fill; breaking out pavement; pl acing and painting range markers; and range clearing. The work to existing dike fields includes bank grading and dressing; riprap paving and placing of stone fill in specified areas of damage and the removal of stone from some areas. The work consists of p lacing approximately 220,000 tons of stone. The estimated cost of the proposed work is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00. The work is located in the Ohio and Mississippi rivers between Mound City, Illinois (Ohio River Mile 972) and Mouth of White Riv er, Arkansas (Mississippi River Mile 599 AHP). The proposed contract listed herein will be awarded under the Partnership Agreement between Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of Defense. Small Business Administration's master requirement  number for this project is 7700-03-3-03065. There is a geographical restriction on this requirement. Competition is restricted to 8(a) contractors located within the geographical areas where the majority of the work is to be performed therefore, competiti on is limited to the following six (6) states, in which the work is to be performed: Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. Participation is permitted for 8(a) concerns in  both the developmental and transitional stages. Interested 8(a) firms are encouraged to request a copy of the solicitation as expeditiously as possible. Special Capabilities Required: The contractor will be required to perform the work based on the FY03 s pecifications that will be issued on or about April 22, 2003. The use of marine construction equipment, highway and some off-highway hauling equipment may be required to perform the work. Examples of such equipment used in the past follow: bulldozer, front -end loader, highway dump trucks, off-highway dump trucks, and a small dragline or hydraulic excavator. An outboard boat and motor equipped with a depth finder capable of obtaining accurate soundings and placement control of subaqueous stone have been used . A barge-mounted Bucyrus-Erie 71-B dragline equipped with 100 feet of boom and 3 cubic yard rock bucket has been used for grading and stone placement. The machine barge was equipped with spuds and winches. The winches are used to raise and lower the spuds . A workboat is needed for moving from one location to another the barge-mounted dragline, loaded rock barge(s), and offices for the contractor/or government inspector. The 8(a) contractor is responsible for an approved stone source or combination of appro ved sources that are capable of supplying the quality, quantities, gradations and rates needed to maintain the scheduled progress of the work for both the revetment repairs and dike repairs.

<DESC>CONTINUATION OF SOLICITATION NO. N65886-03-P5-AC064
    

Services.  The vendor shall provide the following services.

Preservation/ Packaging/ Shipping Requirements.  The contractor shall preserve, package and ship all equipment to the NADEP in Jacksonville, Florida using best commercial practices.
Site Planning Support.  The new test stand will occupy the same general site as the existing test stand.  The contractor shall conduct a site survey to evaluate the existing site for the capability to support the installation, operation, and maintenance of the new test stand. The contractor shall coordinate with the NADEP on test stand removal/installation in order for NADEP personnel to remove Building 795 wall panels for test stand access.  Test stand installation shall meet all applicable EPA regulations. 
Removal and Preservation of Existing Test Stand..  The contractor shall remove and properly preserve the existing J52 Fuel Heater/Anti-Icing Test Stand at the NADEP.  The existing test stand shall be removed immediately prior to installation of the new test stand to minimize downtime and the potential for the NADEP to experience work stoppage in J52 engine production due to nonavailability of a fuel heater/anti-icing test stand.  The contractor shall move the preserved stand to Building 277 at the NADEP.
Acceptance Testing.  Acceptance tests will be conducted in accordance with the approved test plan.  The contractor shall provide the NADEP at least fifteen (15) days written notice (e-mail acceptable) of when the test stand will be ready for factory testing, in order to afford the NADEP the option of being present during testing.  Final acceptance testing will take place at the NADEP in Jacksonville, FL.  Final acceptance will be based on reported test results submitted from the final acceptance testing. 
Training and Training Support.  The contractor shall develop and deliver initial training for complete operation, maintenance and repair of the test stand.  The contractor will perform training of NADEP personnel at the NADEP in Jacksonville, FL concurrent with or immediately following final acceptance testing of the stand.  NADEP personnel to be trained consist of two operators and four maintenance/repair personnel (electronics, pipe fitters and calibration personnel). 
Validation of Test Stands and Manuals.  All servicing, maintenance, repair, operation and calibration procedures in manuals shall be verified by a contractor/ Government team.  Manual validation shall be done immediately following or concurrent with acceptance testing.
Test Stand Correlation.  The contractor shall correlate test stand readings between the new test stand and the NADEP?s existing test stand.  Correlation shall take place after installation of the test stand, during final acceptance testing.
Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The contractor shall participate in a PDR conference for a technical review of the test stand design and installation plans to ensure the operational, maintenance, safety and logistics requirements of the program are met.  The PDR is the primary vehicle for project review and planning.  The PDR conference will be scheduled and hosted by the NADEP. Copies of any installation drawings made by the contractor for test stand installation shall be provided to the Government two weeks prior to the PDR. 
Warranty.  The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  Acceptance of the warranty does not waive the Government?s rights under the Inspection clause, nor does it limit the Government?s rights with regard to the other terms and conditions of this contract.  In the event of a conflict, the terms and conditions of the contract shall take precedence over the warranty.  The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.   

Deliverables. The contractor shall deliver the following information and data to the Government.  The contractor is responsible for any changes to deliverables required for Government acceptance.

Drawings and Associated Lists.  Drawings shall be in contractor format and provide all engineering and design disclosure information to support installation, preparation for use, calibration, operation, fault isolation, repair and maintenance of the test stand.  The information shall, at a minimum, consist of: test stand operational and maintenance space required, facility service hookup locations, test stand interior layout, wiring/piping schematics, troubleshooting trees, parts list and overall dimensions of the test stand. 
Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).   The NADEP will provide one of each type UUT (one (1) fuel heater assembly, one (1) fuel heater connector, and one (1) speed governor) to the contractor for correlation and to support acceptance testing (factory and final).  The contractor shall submit a request for these UUTs in writing (e-mail acceptable) to the Government at least 15 days in advance of when these UUTs are required.  Such request shall include a shipping address, contractor point of contact, and telephone number. The contractor shall return these UUTs to the Government in the same condition as provided.  The contractor shall not be responsible for delays due to nonavailability of these UUTs. 
Technical Manuals.   The contractor shall provide two (2) complete sets of technical manuals.  The manuals shall provide detailed instructions to operate, maintain, calibrate, troubleshoot and repair the test stand.  Repair manuals shall include an Illustrated Parts Breakdown and parts list.  Parts list shall provide information on vendor supply sources to include part number, nomenclature, manufacturer?s CAGE code (if applicable), manufacturer?s address and phone number. The product support data shall include, as a minimum, the following:
Test Stand Description. Shall include a digital color photograph of the test stand, physical and functional (purpose) description, and shall provide leading particulars such as facility services required, operating parameters, and safety features.
Preparation for Use and Storage.  Shall include packing, preservation, service connection, initial adjustment, calibration requirements, and flushing procedure.
Maintenance.  Shall include all operational checkouts, inspection, preventive maintenance, troubleshooting, service, repair and testing.  
Calibration Requirements.  A complete description of all calibration equipment, standards, tolerances and procedures that are required in order to initially adjust and calibrate the test stand, and the frequency of calibration required to maintain the test stand within specified limits of accuracy is required.

Acceptance Test Plan. An acceptance test plan, in contractor format, no later than 30 days prior to acceptance test, for Government approval is required. 
Acceptance Test Report.  Upon successful completion of acceptance testing, the contractor shall submit an acceptance test report no later than 30 days after successful completion of test. 

Technical capability of the proposed test stand to meet the Government requirements will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in the proposal.  Therefore, it is imperative that each offeror provides sufficient technical documentation, specifications, etc. in order for the Government to perform an adequate technical assessment.  Product sales literature such as bulletins and specification sheets typically do not provide sufficient information for an adequate assessment.  In addition, a statement that the proposed test stand will operate per the Government?s specification will not suffice without a description of how the proposed test stand capabilities, features, and general design will meet the Government?s design requirements as specified in this RFP.  

Due to the critical importance of the test stand to Depot operations, only contractors with strong past performance in design, manufacturing, and installation of test stands are encouraged to respond.  In addition, this requirement is time sensitive and all proposals should emphasize the ability of the contractor to rapidly design, manufacture, install, and acceptance test a new test stand within the shortest timeframe possible, thereby minimizing the potential for the NADEP to experience work stoppage in J52 engine production due to downtime during removal of the existing test stand and installation of the new test stand, or downtime as a result of maintenance or catastrophic failure of the existing test stand.  The Government requires delivery of the test stand to be made no later than one hundred forty (140) days after date of contract.  Installation shall follow immediately thereafter and be completed no later than one hundred seventy (170) days after date of contract.  Acceptance testing of the test stand and training of NADEP operation, maintenance and repair personnel shall follow after installation and be completed no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after date of contract.  The contractor shall deliver to:  UIC N65886, Naval Air Depot, Building 1449, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville, FL 32212-0016.  Inspection and acceptance shall be at destination, FOB destination.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In making its award determination, the Government will first determine whether an offeror's proposal satisfies the Government's technical requirements as contained in this RFP.  If an offeror's proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  Once the technical acceptability determinations are completed, all offerors' proposals with a test stand determined to meet the Government's technical requirements will be evaluated considering the following factors, listed in descending order of importance:


Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training

Past Performance

Price

Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.  Furthermore, time is of the essence and Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training, individually, is more important than either Past Performance or Price.  

Delivery, installation and acceptance testing of the new fuel heater test stand and the training of NADEP personnel to operate, maintain and repair the new test stand are critical to ensuring continued J52 engine production capability at the NADEP.  As such, proposals that contain an accelerated delivery schedule for the test stand with delivery sooner than the required one hundred forty (140) days after date of contract, installation sooner than the required one hundred seventy (170) days after date of contract, and acceptance testing and training of NADEP personnel sooner than the required one hundred eighty (180) days after date of contract will receive a more favorable evaluation under the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training factor.  

For the Past Performance factor, the offeror shall describe its past performance on similar or related contracts it has held within the last five (5) years which are similar to the requirements in this RFP or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant related or similar past performance. Offerors who present similar contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts to the requirements of this RFP. The offeror should provide the following information regarding its past performance:

1.  Contract Number(s),
2.  Name and phone number of a point of contact at the federal, state, local government or commercial entity for which the contract was performed,
3.  Dollar value of the contract,
4.  Detailed description of the work performed,
5.  Names of subcontractor(s) used, if any, and a description of the extent of work performed by the subcontractor, and  
6.  The number, type and severity of any quality, delivery or cost problems in performing the contract, the corrective action taken and the effectiveness of the corrective action.

If an offeror's proposal is determined to be unacceptable in either the Time of Delivery/Installation/Acceptance Testing/Training factor or the Past Performance factor, the proposal will be rejected and not considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced offeror.

<DESC>NA In conformance with section 246 of the FY99 Defense Authorization Act, the U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) may be granted authority to form, with Private Business and Academic Partner(s), a Federally Chartered Mixed Corporation following rules normall y associated with Limited Liability Companies. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to determine which businesses and universities might be interested in joining ATC in this venture.  Selection based on this synopsis is pending approval by the office of the Secretary of Defense. The following welcome, and discussion of terms and conditions, is provided by the Office of the Technical Director for ATC to introduce you to this venture: Dear Colleagues: 	Pending approval by the Secretary of Defense, we are about to embark on a very novel experiment that will team industry, academia and the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) into a Limited Liability Company (LLC).  While other precedents exist, this is a first in the Test and Evaluation community. 	We have studied many variations of partnering and believe that forming an LLC with members who compliment our strengths and who are willing to work with us to test this concept, result in a win for all members.  As you review the web page and solicitation , I encourage you to consider joining us on this unique venture.  We believe that the LLC can be a catalyst for technology transfer essential to transforming the Army and strengthening our National Defense.  It will also facilitate private sector access to  very unique government facilities and equipment. 	We are soliciting for members pending receipt of Authority to actually form the company and start the test.  The Secretary of Defense has the prerogative of seeking additional enabling legislation and/or approving the execution of this test.  Should the S ecretary elect to defer action pending more legislation or disapprove execution of the test, then work on this project will either pause or stop.  ATC can accept no liability for any effort and costs that companies or universities responding to this Source s Sought Synopsis may incur. 	I look forward to working with you.  I feel certain that by blending our talents and infrastructure we can meet and even exceed our individual goals and be a key resource as we transform defense. 					James W. Fasig A selection committee will recommend the methods of selection to the Selection Authority. The Selection Authority will choose the founding members to form the National Testing, Training Technology Company (NT3C) LLC. The NT3C Operating Agreement shall cont ain provisions for selection of additional members and termination procedures for departing members. The company to be formed, NT3C, will be a for profit Limited Liability Company. The objective is to identify, document, and develop enhanced methods in Tes t and Evaluation (T&E) product production to result from the blending of the physical and intellectual properties of its military, academia, and private business members. It is anticipated that the NT3C will produce high quality and highly efficient T&E su pport to its customers. The formation of NT3C is an experiment that will last for five years with subsequent five-year option periods. The NT3C will demonstrate the use of state of the art business-like practices in a T&E environment. The Army's strategic goals for this endeavor are to fully utilize the ATC industrial capacity; to increase industry access to the ATC's unique testing capabilities; to simplify small business dealings with the Government; to enhance reinvestment into needed equipment and infra structure, and; to evolve more business-like practices in the Government T&E sector. Interested potential members may obtain the Draft Business Plan for NT3C, the NT3C Operating Agreement and the Selection Criteria from the ATC Website http://www.atc.army. mil/ATC_Pilot_Program/index.html. Interested parties must submit a White Paper of not more than five pages des cribing: the name and major competencies of their organization, how their organization would fit into the company and help achieve overarching goals and a summary of talents and skills employed by the organization, recognizing that the Selection Criteria w ill be applied to evaluation responses. This White Paper is due to the Contracting Officer not later than 45 days after the date of this synopsis. A panel will review the submitted White Papers and will rigorously apply the Selection Criteria to the White Papers in order to select an initial cadres of prospective Members. Pending approval to proceed, ATC will then host an industry /academia day to brief the potential members on the LLC and ATC's capabilities.   Pending a decision to continue the selection p rocess,  candidates identified as prospective members will then be requested to submit both an oral presentation and a written proposal.  As part of their proposal, prospective members will be invited to make an oral presentation regarding their interest a nd capability to meet NT3C goals to the selection panel. Details concerning the oral presentation format and procedures are identified. The remaining portion of the proposal will be submitted in writing, as identified in the selection criteria. Again, the Selection Criteria will form the basis for evaluation of both the oral presentations and written proposals. The Selection Authority may provide additional guidance regarding the oral presentations including further refinements of the Selection criteria, wh ich will be provided to all selectees. After the oral and written presentations, the panel will select the initial members of the NT3C. The selectees will be notified in writing and provided with a copy of the Operating Agreement for their review. The sele cted prospective Members must submit, within 15 days of notification, a signed Operating Agreement, a Draft Business Development Plan Concept Paper based on t he NT3C concept and a nomination of an individual to serve on the Board of Members with sufficien t authority to participate in the Board of Members Deliberations.  Funds in the form of a  A cashier's check of $150,000 payable to a designated ATC account will be requested from candidates via a notice letter after Secretary of Defense approval to procee d is granted. The prospective Member's funds will be held in escrow until the formation of the company and all funds are deposited into the NT3C or, if for some reason the NT3C is not formed, the check will be returned within 7 days of this event and there  will be no further claims by either party. Once all Members have completed the above implementation details, the Commander of ATC or her designate, will establish a date for the initial organizational meeting of the NT3C Board of Members and shall publish  the date of the Board of Members meeting in accordance with the Board of Members notification procedures of the Operating Agreement. The company will commence operations subsequent to that meeting.    Technical POC: Mr. Jack Roth, 410-278-0537, e-mail: jroth@atc.army.mil Contracting Advisor: Jeffrey R.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education, Office of the Secretary, is requesting competitive proposals in order to award a purchase order to obtain services of a contractor  to develop a speaker's reference book on the No Child Left Behind legislation.    Senior level Department staff are frequently interviewed by the national and local media.  They give speeches and attend conferences and meetings with representatives of educational institutions, state and local governments, and members of the public.  They must convey information and respond to questions concerning the No Child Left Behind legislation.  The Department requires a comprehensive and easy-to-use speaker's reference book incorporating the material on NCLB to equip ED staff with information to respond to questions on all the issues raised by NCLB.  The contractor must sort through and organize the vast amount of material which has been generated on NCLB, including the speeches, brochures, briefing papers, etc. which have been generated within the Department, to develop a comprehensive reference book including Q&A format, to equip staff to respond to questions.  The reference book must be easy to use, create consistency of message and information, and equip the speaker to deal with hostile or uninformed questions in an accurate, credible, and positive fashion.  The contractor must be familiar with the complex provisions of No Child Left Behind, and must have an extensive background in communications and public relations activities, with a demonstrated record of success in communicating complex information on education issues persuasively to diverse audiences, including general and specialized media and the general public.   The vendor should provide a comprehensive draft within 30 days of receiving the award and incorporate changes by the Department within two weeks of receiving the changes.   Contractors will be evaluated based on knowledge of NCLB, experience performing similar work, communications expertise, and price.   All responsible sources may submit a quotation that, if timely received, shall be considered by the agency.   Contact Coleatha Carter at 202-401-3082; email:  Coleatha.Carter@ed.gov.

<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) and the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), intends to negotiate with Starks Associates for a modification of its contract No. N01-AI-05402, that was awarded as a 100% small business set-aside, under SIC 8731; NAICS 541710; size standard of 500 employees. This contract provides support to NIAID’s research to identify therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), various opportunistic infections (OI’s) associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  Lead compounds are identified through individual research grants as well as DAIDS-sponsored programs such as the Integrated Preclinical/Clinical Program for novel HIV therapies and the National Cooperative Drug Discovery Groups for AIDS-associated OIs. Researchers in these and other DAIDS-sponsored pre-clinical programs are activity engaged in investigating the basic biology of the targeted pathogens, identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by these infectious agents, and testing therapeutic strategies in vitro and in animal models. This contract provides resynthesis of potential therapeutic agents for treatment of infectious diseases.  The planned negotiated modification will provide for a level of increased effort over a period of four (4) years (within the contract’s current period) in order to: (1) develop prodrug for cidofovir and to perform other antiviral synthesis, (2) increase the synthesis of the number of potential anti-infective agents of diverse classes of organic and organometallic compounds and (3) to fulfill an urgent need for synthesis of biodefense reagents.  This will be for immediate use in a variety of preclinical and clinical drug development projects by investigators supported by the DMID.  This activity will require expansion of all aspects of the contractor’s infrastructure, already in place, to meet this requirement for rapid response to the immediate and intensified synthesis demands of the Institute.  Authority:  41 USC 253(c)(1), as set for in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this requirement. If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by the closing date noted above.  See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The BEP is requesting industry review and comment on the attached description contained in an MS Word file, regarding BEP's plans to examine the feasibility of processing currency sheets in excess of 32 notes per sheet.  Accordingly, vendors are requested to submit available information regarding their current and prototype printing, processing and finishing equipment.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR FIRM PROPOSALS, AND NO CONTRACT AWARD IS PLANNED FROM THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  Information will be viewed by U.S. Government personnel for the purposes of identifying equipment of potential use to the BEP in manufacturing the currency of the United States.
Due to security restrictions, there will be little or no opportunity to hold face-to-face meetings at this time.  In addition, due to the volume of responses anticipated, it may not be possible to return phone calls prior to the submission of the requested technical information.  Therefore, vendors should submit the requested information and the Government will contact vendors with equipment possessing the capabilities needed if further information is needed.  Again, this is not a request for firm proposals and no contract award is planned from this request for information.  However, the BEP will identify and program funding based in part on information received from this announcement, therefore vendors are encouraged to respond with available information electronically to george.robertson@bep.treas.gov.  Vendors are discouraged from hand-delivering materials to the BEP due to security requirements.  If materials are hand-delivered, the courier must be instructed to go to the employee entrance of the BEP, contact the procurement office and wait until materials are picked up by procurement personnel.  The security police officers will not accept materials from couriers.  The address for hand-delivery or courier-delivery is BEP Procurement, Attn:  George Robertson, 13th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228. Call 202-874-3255 or 202-874-3142 for pickup. The address for overnight mail or regular mail delivery is Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Office of Procurement, Equip and Services Division, Attn:  George Robertson, 14th and C Streets, SW, Washington, DC 20228.

<SUBJECT>84 -- Market Research on Uniform Programs
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-USP-RFI-001
<RESPDATE>050703
<ARCHDATE>05222003
<CONTACT>Robert Singman, Contract Specialist, Phone 202/228-47781, Fax 202/228-2058, Email robert_singman@cap-police.senate.gov
<DESC>Request for Information:  The United States Capitol Police (USCP) is conducting market research for the purpose of investigating the possibility of awarding a uniform contract to be used to replace its current employee run quartermaster system.  Information obtained as a result of this RFI is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of a submission to this RFI and the use of the information by the Government.

The USCP is a federal police organization with approximately 1500 law enforcement officers that are issued uniform components and accessories.  The number of employees will be increasing over the next several years, which will place a larger burden on the existing resources.  The Property Division currently issues and tracks the uniform components and accessories.  The USCP has several uniforms to include the ceremonial dress, class type, special teams, and uniform components particular to the USCP.  These uniform components are currently warehoused on-site and disbursed to the officers Monday through Friday between 0600 and 1600.  The current Inventory and Tracking Control System that is used is a mainframe system that was developed internally which needs to be modernized in order for the USCP to realize efficiencies.  The system also has limited reporting capabilities, which does not support efficient management of the current process.

The USCP is looking for an innovative approach to incorporate best business practices in developing a uniform program.  The USCP is interested in understanding the pros and cons of modernizing its quartermaster system versus obtaining contractor support for managing the quartermaster function.  Should the USCP decide to obtain contractor support for managing the function, the Contractor would be responsible for acquiring all uniform components, providing inventory control and management, warehousing and tracking inventories, and ensuring timely delivery of all uniform components in accordance with best commercial practices.  One option the USCP is considering is having items delivered directly to the officer at the officer’s residence.  Should the USCP choose to modernize its current process, the RFI should address how the officers would order and receive uniform components managed by the Property Division.  It is requested that interested respondents provide the Government with a rough order of magnitude (ROM) based on the information provided above.  Industry responses to the RFI must be in MS Word and shall be submitted to the USCP, Attn: Contracting Officer, no later than 30 calendar days from publication of this notice in FedBizOps.  Respondents to this RFI may be requested to provide additional information and/or details based on the initial submission.  At this time the USCP will not hold discussions or entertain presentations from respondents.  The USCP will not accept phone calls from respondents to discuss the RFI or the current USCP quartermaster system.  Only electronic responses will be accepted and shall be sent to: USCP_procurement@cap-police.senate.gov
