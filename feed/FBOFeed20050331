<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities and major repair and alteration projects in the State of Hawaii.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet and are categorized as Carrier Annexes, Postal Retail Facilities, Delivery Distribution Centers, Main Post Offices, Stations or Branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the area over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 10,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual.  (2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed, expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.  (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  The list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base. This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each. The NAICS Code is 541330. A-E services are required for the preparation of parametric estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $2,250,000 with the maximum task order amount of $299,000. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000 for the life of the contract. The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, plumbing, electrical, management information systems (MIS) technicians, fire protection, site work, and mechanical requirements. Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required. Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm. The firm(s) must also be able to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services. All drawings are to be in electronic attachment format, DFX or DGN format and shall be 100% compatible with Computer Assisted Design Drawing Software (CADD).  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  The selected firm(s) must have the capability of providing final drawings formatted in AutoCAD 2002 or higher.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet. Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system. Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness. The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites. All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their sub-contractors. The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions. For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work. Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns to include all elements referenced in FAR 52.219-9. All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  All offerors in response to this solicitation shall complete electronic annual representation and certifications at http://www.bpn.gov/orca in conjunction with required regisistration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

<DESC>The West Campus of St Elizabeths, a former mental health facility, consists of 182 acres and 61 buildings constructed between the 1850s and the 1960s. The buildings contain approximately 1.1 million gross square feet of space. The entire site, including the brick wall running along Martin Luther King Jr. Ave, is a National Historic Landmark. Another feature of the West Campus is a Civil War graveyard on the western slope overlooking Bolling Air Force Base. From 1953 to December 2004, St. Elizabeths was controlled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). On October 1, 1987 HHS gave the District of Columbia a license to operate and maintain several buildings on the West Campus. DC terminated this agreement in 2004, in anticipation of the transfer of the property to GSA from HHS. The structures and grounds of the West Campus are generally in a deteriorated condition.  The East Campus of St. Elizabeths is excluded from this Request for Proposals (RFP). It is intended that the West Campus will remain in Federal ownership and will be redeveloped as either a multi- or single-tenanted, high security campus for Federal agency tenants. To fully understand the maximum development potential of St. Elizabeths – West Campus, GSA seeks a qualified contractor (Contractor) to complete a Land Use Feasibility Analysis and Campus Master Plan to house federal agency tenants. Contractor will also provide all necessary services to ensure GSA’s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). Services shall commence on or about April 1, 2005, and continue through September 30, 2006.  The government intends to award one firm fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation.  Source selection procedures will be used (see FAR 15.3).  The government reserves the right to award without discussions so offerors should not expect to have an opportunity to correct deficiencies in their offers.  The evaluation factors for award include:  Past Experience, Work Statement, Project Schedule, Subcontracting Plan and Cost.  Copies of the solicitation will be available on or about January 19, 2005.  A pre-proposal conference is scheduled for January 25, 2005.  Additional details on this conference will be provided in the solicitation.  GSA is issuing this solicitation electronically only.  Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.eps.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation file.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>This is a solicitation announcement.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be soliciting bids utilizing full and open competition for the construction of Phases I, II, III, IV and V of the Academy-Wide Masonry Repair and Restoration Project at the FBI Academy, U.S. Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia 22135.  The original 1972 FBI Academy encompassed a total of eleven (11) masonry buildings.  Over the past 32 years, all of these original masonry buildings have suffered exterior surface damage and discoloration as well as serious water infiltration as a result of deterioration of the masonry (brick) units, deterioration of the masonry mortar and deterioration of the “expressed” concrete structural elements.  Poor 1972 masonry construction on many buildings as well as poor design detailing at several conditions has contributed to serious water infiltration into the buildings.  Additionally, many of the buildings have architectural features that involve both horizontal and sloped brick surfaces.  Many of these surfaces have deteriorated to the point that organic matter and plants have infiltrated the surface, which promotes water retention and accelerates the deterioration through the annual freeze-thaw cycle.  Several of the areas have been unsuccessfully repaired in the past and these repairs have actually promoted further deterioration.  The masonry restoration will be broken down and bid approximately yearly in the following phases: Phase I: Buildings 1, 2, 3, and 4, with Bldg. 5 as an Add Alternate; Phase II: Buildings 7 and 8; Phase III: Buildings 6, 9 and 10; Phase IV: Buildings 11, 12 and 16; and Phase V: Building 5 (if required).  The masonry repair and restoration work for Phases I, II, III, IV and V consists of, but is not limited to the following work: scaffolding, landscape/lawn protection and repair, selective cutting and removal of face brick veneer and brick pavers, selective removal and repair of mortar joints in brick veneer, selective removal, salvage and reinstallation of metal coping and flashing, selective repair of spalled precast concrete beams, selective demolition and rebuilding of building parapets, mortar re-pointing, installation of new face brick, brick pavers, drainage boards, metal copings, EPDM base flashing,  joint sealers, modified bitumen waterproofing membranes, new architectural precast concrete column caps, spandrel panels and parapet copings, misc. steel angles, reinforcing and anchors, concrete coatings and masonry cleaning.  The estimated cost of the combined acquisitions is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000. Bid, Payment and Performance Bonds are required.  The FBI contemplates the award of a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this requirement.   The bidder awarded the resultant contract shall be subject to background investigations on its company and all individuals assigned to the project.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, intends to award a firm fixed price contract on a sole source basis to the University of Utah, 1471 E. Federal Way, Salt Lake City, UT  84112 for the development of a software program that will parameterize aluminum ignition, combustion, and diffusion models found in explosions like that of a Hellfire warhead detonation, which can be integrated in a turbulent model.  The simulation must be quantitatively validated reaction chemistry and turbulent mixing component that can be used in CTH or ALE3D.  The intended use for the outcome of this work is to provide a framework and tools that will apply to both gaseous and particle-laden combustion from a hellfire warhead detonation.  The University of Utah is uniquely qualified because they are the authors of the software specific to sub grid modeling.  The University of Utah developed computational tools used to assess complex problems evidenced in the enhanced blast. !  The computer codes utilized in the computational tools have been verified and validated by the Center for the Simulation of Accidental Fires and Explosions (CSAFE) software.  The University of Utah is the only contractor who can develop this model because of their prior research and development of the necessary software tools and their extensive experience in massively parallel, large eddy simulations of liquid fuel fires.  Estimated length of contract is one basic year with two one year options.  Out years work is anticipated to improve the Reaction Model development.  Respondents, other than the above, should submit, at a minimum, their qualifications and any other information considered pertinent to the requirement to the Contract Specialist within 30 days after publication of synopsis.  The POC for this requirement is Kim Matsunaga, Contract Specialist at (760) 939-7084 by phone, (760) 939-8329 by fax, or Kim.Matsunaga@navy.mil by electronic mail.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) is conducting a series of interrelated studies aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. The first two studies that will address both public and private policies and initiatives are the Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study and the Employment Study. As the third study in the NCD series, the proposed Financial Incentives Study should: (a) identify among other tasks what factors influence the use of financial incentives by employers, employees and potential employees who are people with disabilities; (b) assess what is needed to address those factors to increase the use of existing incentives and/or create new incentives; (c) look within and beyond the workplace regarding the potential role of financial incentives in the increased hiring of and/or for use by people with disabilities with respect to aspects of living that also impact obtaining and maintaining meaningful employment (e.g., affordable and accessible assistive technology, housing, transportation, health care, personal assistants and other supports); (d) set forth a model that provides economic analysis of benefits to costs for employers, and (e) as appropriate reflect connections with NCD’s Social Security and the employment studies. This could include final report recommendations for necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative changes or new actions that benefit both employers and people with disabilities.  The estimated contract is for 12 months. NCD will distribute its Financial Incentives Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested Parties on April 29, 2005.

NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by June 14, 2005. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of April 29, 2005. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Gerrie Hawkins, Ph.D. 1331 F Street, N.W., Suite 850, Washington, D.C. 20004, ghawkins@ncd.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring & Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) with Radiance Research of Seattle, WA for a three wavelength Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP).  The photometer measures the light absorption coefficient of atmospheric aerosol at three wavelengths.  CMDL uses this parameter combined with another measurement to calculate the aerosol single scattering albedo, a critical parameter needed to estimate aerosol related climate change.  Critical specifications of the absorption coefficient measurement are as follows:  1) the measurement span multiple wavelengths across the visible light spectrum; 2) the instrument have a well defined calibration to adjust for scattering from the filter surface; and 3) the measurement wavelengths correspond within 50 nm to those measured by the TSI3563 nephelometer.  4) a published calibration is available to convert the raw instrument light attenuation measurements to an aerosol light absorption coefficient at each wavelength; 5) the instrument time response (i.e., averaging time) must be 10 seconds or less for - A) synchronization with other components of CMDL's ground based aerosol systems with minimal data loss, and B) use on our research aircraft that require a fast time response for increased spatial resolution.  It is the government’s belief that the instrument from Radiance Research is the only commercially available unit that meets all the required specifications.  This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100K).  This notice is for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH SIX MONTHS

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES, OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO CENTER FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS RESEARCH & ANALYSIS (CHSRA).  CLOSING DATE IS APRIL 14, 2005.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS TO: 

BACKGROUND: THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ), HAS NUMEROUS OPEN INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST NURSING HOME CHAINS AND SPECIFIC FACILITIES FOR, AMONG OTHER REASONS, ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT. DOJ HAS FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST THE FACILITIES IN MANY OF THESE CASES. THE OFFICE OF COUNSEL TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (OCIG) WORKS WITH DOJ IN THE INVESTIGATION, NEGOTIATION AND SETTLEMENT OF THESE CASES. IN THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION THERE IS A NEED TO PINPOINT THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE POOR CARE BEING PROVIDED BY ANALYZING THE FACILITIES' QUALITY INDICATORS AND SURVEY PERFORMANCE.  IN THE COURSE OF SETTLEMENT, ONE ISSUE THAT ARISES IS WHETHER THE CHAINS AND FACILITIES SHOULD HAVE CORPORATE INTEGRITY AGREEMENTS (CIA) AND WHETHER THOSE CIA'S SHOULD CONTAIN PROVISIONS REGARDING QUALITY OF CARE. IN REACHING ITS DECISIONS ON BOTH INVESTIGATIVE AND CIA ISSUES, THE OCIG REQUIRES DATA ANALYSIS AND ADVICE FROM LONG TERM CARE EXPERTS TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE CHAINS AND FACILITIES IN PROVIDING CARE TO RESIDENTS. IN PARTICULAR, OCIG NEEDS THE ASSISTANCE OF HEALTH SYSTEMS AND DATA RESEARCH EXPERTS WITH ACCESS TO SPECIAL COMPUTER PROGRAMS AND EQUIPMENT TO ANALYZE OSCAR AND MDS DATA, AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION THAT MAY COME TO THE ATTENTION OF OCIG.

THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS IDENTIFIED SUCH NURSING HOME QUALITY OF CARE ISSUES AS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE OIG. AS PART OF THE OIG'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND ITS BENEFICIARIES, THE OIG REQUIRES INDUSTRY DATA AND EXPERT OPINIONS ON APPROPRIATE QUALITY OF CARE INDICATORS THAT ARE NECESSARY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE CASES. 

PURPOSE: REVIEW, ANALYZE, CONDUCT RESEARCH AND RENDER EXPERT OPINIONS ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES RELATED TO SPECIFIC NURSING HOME FACILITIES, NURSING HOME CORPORATIONS, AND GENERALLY TO THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO QUALITY OF CARE, DEFICIENCIES, SEVERITY OF DEFICIENCIES, QUALITY INDICATORS, STAFF-TO-RESIDENT RATIOS, STAFFING TURNOVER, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING.



OBJECTIVES:

	THE GOALS OF A LONG-TERM CARE CONSULTANT ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. TO REVIEW, ANALYZE, RESEARCH, AND OPINE ON APPROPRIATE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY DATA WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC FACILITIES AND CHAINS AS REQUESTED BY THE OCIG.
		2. TO PREPARE ROUTINE AND AD-HOC REPORTS ON INDIVIDUAL NURSING HOMES, NURSING HOME CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO REPORTS COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE MEASURES IDENTIFIED ABOVE.
3. TO CONSULT WITH OCIG AND OTHER OIG COMPONENTS TO INTERPRET THE ABOVE DATA AND REPORTS, AND TO ASSIST THE OIG IN MAKING DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE NEED FOR AND MONITORING OF A CIA. 
4. TO PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS WITH OIG AND PROVIDERS ABOUT PERFORMANCE ON THE MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON
THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO USE THE CENTER FOR HEALTH SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS (CHSRA), TO REVIEW, ANALYZE, CONDUCT RESEARCH, AND RENDER EXPERT OPINIONS AS PART OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL'S (OIG) ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE NURSING HOME FACILITIES. THE OIG HAS IDENTIFIED CHSRA AS THE PREEMINENT ORGANIZATION CAPABLE OF CONDUCTING THE SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE OIG.

THE CONTRACTOR HAS A LONG HISTORY AND EXCELLENT NATIONWIDE REPUTATION FOR PERFORMING THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES FOR A VARIETY OF CLIENTELE THAT INCLUDES GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHSRA HAS ANALYZED MINIMUM DATA SET (MDS) AND SURVEY HISTORY DATA FOR SEVERAL NURSING HOME CHAINS AND RENDERED OPINIONS ON THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED BY THOSE CHAINS, AND PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS CONFERENCES WITH OIG AND NURSING FACILITY REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING THE QUALITY OF CARE ISSUES AT STAKE IN THEIR CASES.  THE CONTRACTOR HAS DEVELOPED SEVERAL UNIQUE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ENABLE ITS STAFF TO ANALYZE MDS AND SURVEY HISTORY DATA IN A PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL WAY.  




THE CONTRACTOR'S STAFF CONSISTS OF PERSONS WITH A UNIQUE SET OF CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SKILLS NEEDED TO PERFORM THIS WORK.  STAFF HAS A COMBINED SET OF MORE THAN 100 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN QUALITY ASSURANCE IN LONG TERM CARE, FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION IN THIS AREA.  THE CONTRACTOR'S STAFF, DEVELOPED THE ORIGINAL SET OF NURSING HOME QUALITY INDICATORS THAT ARE STILL USED IN ALL 17,000 NURSING HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES AND SURVEY AGENCIES IN ALL 50 STATES. THEY HAVE CONDUCTED VISITS TO MORE THAN 300 NURSING HOMES IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS.  
OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, THERE ARE ADDITIONAL NURSING HOME CASES IN WHICH THE SAME TYPE OF ANALYSIS AND ASSISTANCE IS REQUIRED. BASED ON THE OIG'S PRIOR RESEARCH AND EXPERIENCE, THE CONTRACTOR HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND EXPERIENCED ORGANIZATION WITH THE UNIQUE EXPERTISE NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAM DATA THAT WILL ASSIST THE OIG IN IDENTIFYING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, TRENDS AND OTHER INFORMATION AS NECESSARY. THE CONTRACTOR HAS UNIQUE COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE RESOURCES THAT ENABLE IT TO PERFORM SOPHISTICATED ANALYSES OF MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MDS AND OSCAR DATA.  STAFF MEMBERS HAVE DEVELOPED THE SOFTWARE THAT IS USED BY CMS AND ALL STATE SURVEY AGENCIES AND ALL 17,000 NURSING HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES TO ACCESS THE MDS QUALITY INDICATORS FOR BOTH EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEY ACTIVITIES AND INTERNAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES BY INDIVIDUAL NURSING HOMES AND NURSING HOME CORPORATIONS.  
THE COMBINATION OF COMPUTER CAPABILITIES AND PERSONNEL WITH THE REQUISITE EXPERTISE TO INTERPRET THE DATA AND PAST EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES TO THE OIG MAKE THE CONTRACTOR, THE ONE ORGANIZATION THAT CAN MEET THE OIG'S CONTRACTUAL NEEDS.
THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
West Palm Beach, Florida

The United States Government intends to award a succeeding lease, using other than full and open competition to Reflections Office Center, of West Palm Beach, Florida.  The lease will be for 7,300 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of five-years 

The Government has a continuing need for this space.  It has been determined that a succeeding lease will result in less cost to the Federal Government when the economics of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government’s intention to award this project under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Louise Long, Contracting Officer, at louisem.long@gsa.gov  or to her attention at GSA, Realty Services Division, Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida.  Any written comments are to be received by the Contracting Officer April 15, 2005.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Seismic and geotechnical investigations have established that an earthquake larger than a 5.7 magnitude could cause liquefaction of the foundation sands and potential failure of the embankment. The Maximum Credible Earthquake for consideration at the dam i s a 6.6 magnitude. Depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, significant deformation of the entire embankment, and release of the lake is possible. In order to address the risk of embankment breach during an earthquake, the foundation under the embankment is to be stabilized using jet grouting to mix cement into the foundation sands under the upstream slope of the dam and deep soil mixing to accomplis h similar goals beneath the downstream slope of the dam. This ground modification project could potentially involve the treatment of over 400,000 cubic yards of soil.  A jet grout cement cutoff wall that extends to bedrock beneath the dam to stop normal se epage through the sand beneath the dam is also required.   The project web site is http://www.nwk.usace.army.mil/projects/tcdam/index.htm.  The Tuttle Creek Evaluation Report and Environmental Impact Statement are available for download from the web page and will be included in the solicitation for specific backgr ound on the project.  Historic drawings, subsurface information, and other project related information will also be provided with the solicitation.   SERVICES REQUIRED The Contractor shall provide personnel, equipment, and materials as needed to perform all required services including, but not limited to, those described in the solicitation.  The scope of services under the base contract includes preconstruction services  and jet grout seepage cutoff wall construction.  Subsequent options may be awarded based on mutually agreed upon and separately negotiated options for a full scale field demonstration ground modification test program, cooperative development of a geotechn ical baseline report, and all remaining ground modification and associated work (main construction).  The primary purpose of the geotechnical baseline report is to establish an agreed upon statement of the geotechnical conditions anticipated to be encounte red during construction.  The Contractor must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly preconstruction services, cutoff wall construction, test program construction, geotechnical baseline report, and  main construction portions of the p roject.  The Contractor shall be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of appropriate construction professionals.  The Contractor is expected to maintain the same team from preconstruction services through the test program construction, cutoff w all construction, geotechnical baseline report (GBR), and main construction duration. Under the base contract, the Contractor will be required to construct an upstream jet grout seepage cutoff wall approximately one mile in length.  The cutoff wall will require predrilling of approximately 70 feet through riprap and shale and limestone fill  across the dam and up to 220 feet of predrilling in select areas.  The jet grout cutoff wall will extend up to an additional 150 feet beneath the predrilling bottom elevation.  In addition to the cutoff wall construction, the Contractor shall assist the G overnment during the preconstruction phase by participating in the review and evaluation of the design and construction documentation.  The Contractor is required to work with the Advisory Panel (a team of six experts in geotechnical engineering and ground  modification) and the Government in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design.  The Contractors principal tasks during the preconstruction phase are as follows: 1.	Reviewing and evaluating designs for completeness and constructibility. 2.	Finalizing of a test program plan. 3.	Preparing cost estimates and construction schedules. 4.	Evaluating costs for design alternatives. 5.	Conducting VE analyses as needed to support cost and constructibility initiatives. 6.	Performing administrative and other services as defined in the solicitation. The government anticipates award of the base contract by July 2005.  Award of the test program construction option and geotechnical baseline report option are tentatively scheduled for the fall of 2005.  Award of the construction option is tentatively sche duled for 2006.  All awards are subject to authorization and appropriation of funds for the project by Congress.  Funding for Fiscal Year 2005 work is available.  The Government does not guarantee award within this period nor shall the Government be liable  for any costs should award occur before or after this period or occur at all.  Estimated combined project cost range (preconstruction services, cutoff wall construction, test program construction option, geotechnical baseline report option, and main const ruction option) is estimated to be between $150,000,000 and $200,000,000.  The contractor shall be a member of the project development team during design and construction phases, along with the Corps of Engineers- Kansas City District, the selected Advisor y Panel A-E Firm, and other government entities.  Extent of participation during preconstruction services, design, performance on the cutoff wall construction, and cost will be considered when deciding to award the various options.

<DESC>US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has identified an urgent and compelling need for a functional, deployable system to support USSOCOM Joint Task Force efforts in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The required system capability is a direct result of mission preparation, mission execution and interoperability gaps identified during Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM and other ongoing classified USSOCOM missions.

Specifically, USSOCOM requests the rapid fielding of prototype WARRIOR REACH systems for operational assessment prior to follow-on procurement and operational fielding. 

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency."  

The Government will synopsize this proposed sole source award to Visual Awareness Technologies & Consulting, Inc (VATC) and will consider contractors that respond to the synopsis and meets the Government's requirements and schedule.  The point of contact for VATC is Mike Vaughn at (850) 240-9017. 

	a.  The WARRIOR REACH project is a joint initiative to integrate real-world intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities into USSOCOM mission preparation and operational architectures to improve current mission preparation, testing and operational capabilities. WARRIOR REACH directly supports USSOCOM’s GWOT Joint Task Force efforts by addressing mission preparation, execution, and interoperability gaps identified in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM AND IRAQI FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) lessons learned. It also facilitates and supports OSD’s Training Transformation Strategic and Implementation Plans and USJFCOM’s Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) training transformation initiative.  Specifically, the WARRIOR REACH project will provide a deployable, line-of-sight (LOS), web-based architecture (Version 1.0) that supports special operations forces/conventional forces (SOF/CF) mission preparation, testing and real-world operational requirements.  WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will provide an organic, deployable network capability wherein Live, Virtual, and Constructive information can be correlated and displayed in a web-based environment without the need for national collection assets, wideband communications, and/or traditional infrastructure. WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will allow all echelons of command to interactively collaborate for analysis, planning, training, testing and rehearsal. The WARRIOR REACH V1.0 architecture will be used to display a dynamic 2D/3D Common Operational Picture (COP) across command elements.  At the tactical echelons, Tactical Display Units (TDUs) and applications will allow filtered/refreshed information to display geographical knowledge of assets and threats in the deployed environment for effective coordination and execution of missions in training, rehearsal, testing and operational environments.

	b.  The provider must be fully knowledgeable of and privy to and have access to the current USSOCOM operational requirements.  The provider must possess the necessary TS/SCI security clearances.   Given the time constraints involved and importance for immediate development and delivery of the required prototype systems limits the number of potential offerors.

	c.  Schedule requirements dictate that the contractor be prepared to support and participate in operational assessments scheduled for SOPAC in May 2005 and SOCEUR in June 2005.  Preparation for the operational assessments will require initial integration and testing from April 2005 through May 2005.  These assessments are critical to definitizing the operational requirements and subsequent development and fielding of an operational WARRIOR REACH system.  Any delay in conduct of the assessments will result in a delay in the development and fielding of the WARRIOR REACH system and the operational gaps identified during current, ongoing USSOCOM missions will remain.  As such, US military force lives, equipment, and mission accomplishment continue to be at increased risk until the WARRIOR REACH system is fielded.

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.

As such, US military force lives, equipment, and mission accomplishment continue to be at increased risk until the WARRIOR REACH system is fielded.

<DESC>US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) has identified an urgent and compelling need for a functional, deployable system to support USSOCOM Joint Task Force efforts in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The required system capability is a direct result of mission preparation, mission execution and interoperability gaps identified during Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM and other ongoing classified USSOCOM missions.

Specifically, USSOCOM requests the rapid fielding of prototype WARRIOR REACH systems for operational assessment prior to follow-on procurement and operational fielding. 

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency."  

The Government will synopsize this proposed sole source award to Visual Awareness Technologies & Consulting, Inc (VATC) and will consider contractors that respond to the synopsis and meets the Government's requirements and schedule.  The point of contact for VATC is Mike Vaughn at (850) 240-9017. 

	a.  The WARRIOR REACH project is a joint initiative to integrate real-world intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities into USSOCOM mission preparation and operational architectures to improve current mission preparation, testing and operational capabilities. WARRIOR REACH directly supports USSOCOM’s GWOT Joint Task Force efforts by addressing mission preparation, execution, and interoperability gaps identified in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM AND IRAQI FREEDOM (OEF/OIF) lessons learned. It also facilitates and supports OSD’s Training Transformation Strategic and Implementation Plans and USJFCOM’s Joint National Training Capability (JNTC) training transformation initiative.  Specifically, the WARRIOR REACH project will provide a deployable, line-of-sight (LOS), web-based architecture (Version 1.0) that supports special operations forces/conventional forces (SOF/CF) mission preparation, testing and real-world operational requirements.  WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will provide an organic, deployable network capability wherein Live, Virtual, and Constructive information can be correlated and displayed in a web-based environment without the need for national collection assets, wideband communications, and/or traditional infrastructure. WARRIOR REACH V1.0 will allow all echelons of command to interactively collaborate for analysis, planning, training, testing and rehearsal. The WARRIOR REACH V1.0 architecture will be used to display a dynamic 2D/3D Common Operational Picture (COP) across command elements.  At the tactical echelons, Tactical Display Units (TDUs) and applications will allow filtered/refreshed information to display geographical knowledge of assets and threats in the deployed environment for effective coordination and execution of missions in training, rehearsal, testing and operational environments.

	b.  The provider must be fully knowledgeable of and privy to and have access to the current USSOCOM operational requirements.  The provider must possess the necessary TS/SCI security clearances.   Given the time constraints involved and importance for immediate development and delivery of the required prototype systems limits the number of potential offerors.

	c.  Schedule requirements dictate that the contractor be prepared to support and participate in operational assessments scheduled for SOPAC in May 2005 and SOCEUR in June 2005.  Preparation for the operational assessments will require initial integration and testing from April 2005 through May 2005.  These assessments are critical to definitizing the operational requirements and subsequent development and fielding of an operational WARRIOR REACH system.  Any delay in conduct of the assessments will result in a delay in the development and fielding of the WARRIOR REACH system and the operational gaps identified during current, ongoing USSOCOM m missions will remain.  As such, US military force lives, equipment, and mission accomplishment continue to be at increased risk until the WARRIOR REACH system is fielded.

QUESTION ONE:  What is the final destination of the moths?
 
ANSWER ONE:  The moths destined for Bakersfield, California are delivered to Shafter, California – Minter Field.

ANSWER TWO:  We would like the moths on the ground in Fabens, Texas between 4 AM and 5 AM each day.  We are flexible about the delivery time for the moths sent to California however; they must be in Shafter, California no later than 3:00 PM each day.

QUESTION THREE:  Is there another airstrip/airport other than Sky Harbor close to the USDA APHIS Bollworm Rearing Facility that could be used in the Phoenix area?

ANSWER THREE:  Yes.  Falcon Field, Mesa, Arizona

<DESC>This announcement extends the due date for White Papers from 5 April 2005,  3:00 p.m. EST to 22 April 2005, 3:00 p.m. EDST.  This announcement also extends the subsequent proposal due date from 17 May 2005 3:00 p.m. EST to 1 June 2005, 3:00 p.m. EDST (Reference page 2 of the BAA.) As a result of the change to the proposal due date, this announcement also changes the oral presentations date.  On page 5 of the BAA, the sentence “Presentations will be held the week of 23 May 2005 at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio” is changed to “Presentations will be held the week of 6 June 2005 at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio.  This announcement replaces the Statement of Work for Task Order 0005 dated 10 February 2005 with a corrected Statement of Work for Task Order 0005 dated 24 March 2005.  The corrected Statement of Work reflects correct paragraph numbering for SOW paragraphs 3.3 through 3.8.  This announcement also clarifies the delivery address for the White Papers.  Page 20 of the BAA requires that an original plus 8 copies of the White Paper be submitted.  The original and 4 copies of the White Papers should be mailed to: Rhonda Knowles, AFRL/PKH, Bldg 167, 2310 Eighth Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH  45433-7801.  The remaining four copies of the White Papers should be mailed to: Jay Carroll, AFRL/HEAO, 6030 Kent Street, Mesa AZ  85242.  White Papers not received at the designated Government office (AFRL/PKH address at Wright-Patterson AFB) by 22 April 2005, 3:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time, will be considered late.  This announcement also provides additional information on the objective of Task Order 0001. On the bottom of page 4/top of page 5 of the BAA, after the sentence: “The objective of Task Order 0001 is to provide overall management and technical support to AFRL/HEA’s basic, exploratory, and advanced development warfighter readiness research contract;” the following is added:  “The intention of the Air Force is that Task Order 0001 will cover Task Orders 0002-0005 AND all future task orders to be issued under the contract.  In addition to Task Orders 0002-0005, we anticipate 11 additional task orders to be awarded by 1 Dec 05.  Additional task orders will be issued periodically after that.  The current contract has 39 Task Orders.”  This announcement also corrects the erroneous references to “items 1-5 below” on pages 7 and 8 of the BAA.   On page 7, Section A.1.c(3), Task Order 0003 Interactive Synthetic Warfighter Models, the reference to “items 1-5 below” is corrected to read “items (a) through (e) below.”  On page 8, Section A.1.c(4), Task Order 0004 Deployable Visual Systems Technology Development, the reference to “items 1-5 below” is corrected to read “items (a) through (h) below.” All other information in the BAA announcement posted on 11 March 2005 remains unchanged.

<CONTACT>Eliza Lee 808-473-7546
<DESC>This is Amendment 0002 to N0060405T0377 originally published on 30 March 2005. This provides responses to questions from prospective vendors. 1. Question: Explaination on the following sentence - System will be sufficiently robust to inhibit"SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE" which results in inoperability of the entire unit and will be self-repairable, at the component level, in a field environmentAre drawings available? Response: Loss of single component shall not result in complete loss of capability to project inputted video/audio sources on displays and speakers (.e degraded mode of operation is supported in the event of critical component failure). 2. Question: does self-repairable mean the system includes circuitry to automatically perform a repair or does it mean an operator in the field can disassemble the unit and perform repair himself in the field?  Response:  Self repairable means major level system components can be exchanged, replaced in a field environmenet.  3. !  Question:  How many systems are being procured? Response:  Only one system is needed.  4.  Question:  CLIN 0002 refers to two (2) 60-inch interactive whiteboard projection systems. These are not mentioned in the system description and requirements.  Are these going to deploy as well? Shall we plan on cases for these in addition to those described in the SOW and in CLIN 0004?  Response:  Yes - Hardigg Transit Cases are required for the whiteboard systems - combined weight of case plus 3M Whiteboard must not exceed 2 man lift requirement of 130 pounds.  5.  Question:  The system describes a 16 x 16 switching matrix and discusses CAT5 (twisted pair) transmission into the system. Can the government clarify what kinds of sources will be connected to the system? Should the 16x16 matrix be capable of supporting just video sources or also high resolution sources such as computers?  Response:  Multiple input sources including composite video, RGB, high resoluction computer video.  6! .  Question:  Do we need to provide interfaces/cabling for your sources or simply the switching system described?  Response:  All interfaces and cabling must be provided.  7.  Question:  The requirement discusses being able to control video and audio independently. Other portions of the requirement seem to indicate that a small control panel is desired. This can simply be the controls on the front of the matrix or a more sophisticated control panel that will allow for full control over the matrix, displays, volume, etc.  Response:  Control panel must provide independent switch control interfacing for all input and output sources in an operator intuitive configuration.  Full control of audio and video connections are required.  8.  Question:  Does the government want speakers on the 40-inch LCD displays required in CLIN 0001? If this system will all be co-located, we can instead mount a speaker in the equipment rack which might make for a more survivable sound capability rath! er than side-mount speakers on the LCD's.  Response:  Panel mounted speakers affiliated with and co-located with each monitor are required.  Must be mounted on or integrated within each display.  The solicitation due date of 11 April 2005 1700 Hawaiian Standard Time remains unchanged.

<CONTACT>Theodore Kowalski, (586) 574-5734
<DESC>SFAE-CSS-TV-M							7 March 2005 	The Product Manager, Tactical Vehicles is seeking data on existing capabilities in performing the roles of Performance Based Logistics Product Support Integrator-Product Support Provider. 	In September 2001, the Quadrennial Review (QDR) mandated implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) with appropriate metrics to compress the supply chain, eliminate non value added steps and improve readiness for major weapon systems and commodit ies.  PBL delineates outcome performance goals of weapon systems, ensures that responsibilities are assigned, provides incentives for attaining these goals and facilitates the overall life cycle management of system reliability, supportability and Total Ow nership Costs. 	In a 16 August memo, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics published guidance for purchasing weapon system logistic support using performance based guidance.  This guidance stated in part, for PBL, performance is defined  in terms of military objectives, using the following criteria: a.	Operational Availability.  The percent of time a weapon system is available for a mission or ability to sustain operations tempo. b.	Operational Reliability:  The measure of a weapon system in meeting mission success objectives (Percent of objectives met by weapon system) Depending on the weapon system, a mission objective could be a sortie, tour, launch, destination reached, capabil ity, etc. c.	Cost Per Unit Usage:  The total operating cost divided by the appropriate unit of measurement for a given weapon system.  Depending on the weapon system, the measurement could be flight hour, steaming hour, launch, mile driven hour operated, etc. d.	Logistics Footprint:  The government/ contractor size or presence of logistics support required to deploy, sustain and move a weapon system.  Measurable elements include inventory/ equipment, tools/special tools, personnel, facilities, transportation as sets and real estate. e.	Logistics Response Time:  This is the period of time from logistics demand signal sent to satisfaction of the logistics demand. Logistics Demand refers to systems, components, or resources, including labor required for weapon systems logistics support . The purpose of this survey is to solicit your interest, current capability, potential growth and intended processes for entering in a Performance Based Logistics Contract/Agreement to support one or more of our weapon systems. Performance Based Logistics Market Survey Questionnaire This market survey questionnaire relates the Product Manager, Medium Tactical Vehicles, need to identify potential Product Support Providers  Product Support Integrators to support the Armys line of Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) Trucks, Trailers, and the  Armored Security Vehicle (ASV).  The Medium Truck Fleet consists of the, Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV), and the M939 5 ton trucks.  The FMTV consists of the 2 ½ ton Light Medium Tactical Vehicles (LMTV) and the 5 ton MTV.  The LMTVs include ca rgos and vans (Models 1078 to M1081).  The MTVs consist of cargos, tractors, dumps, wreckers and vans (Models M1078 through the M1094) and the new production variants with production quantities anticipated to be over 12,000.   The total quantities of FMTV vehicles represented are approximately 37,000.  The M939/A1/A2 5 Ton truck family consists of the cargos, tractors, dumps, wreckers and vans models M923 through the M934 (approximately 38,000 vehicles).  The ASV has a programmed quantity of 1118 vehicles.  The Medium Tactical Fleet of applicable trailers consists of the M105, M967, M969, M1095, M1082, M149, and M1112. General Description: The Contractor shall identify a plan and recommendations by developing a Logistic Support Concept to improve the existing Medium Truck Fleet Mission Capability encompassing areas of performance to include the following: 1. Operation Availability and Reliabili ty by, at a minimum, reducing Non-Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) and Non-Mission Capable Supply (NMCS). 	Example:  NMCM & NMCS:  Measure now and after support concept change. 2. System Annual Maintenance Manhours: Example:  Non-traditional means to fill the gap between the systems requirement for maintenance and the ability of the operator/maintainer to provide maintenance.  Such as in garrison contracted services, lifetime support contracts with component manufactu res such as engine, transmission, etc.  Measure availability now vs. future selected timeline. 3. Diagnostic Time to Test: Example:  Reduce the number of trouble shooting tasks w/o degradation to the fault diagnostic effectiveness.  Measure now vs. later. 4. Speed, Accuracy & Technical Completeness: 	Example:  Availability of technical data.  Available vs. required.  Measure now and later. 5. Training: 	Example:  Reduction in training time needed to maintain proficiency in operating or maintaining equipment.  Development or maintenance of self paced training media that results in higher scores by participants and/or shorter performance times while mainta ining current proficiency.  Training classes that train more students to an established or higher proficiency.  A training regimen that results in a higher % per unit of trained operators and/or maintainers.

Work under each of the contracts will be subject to satisfactory negotiations of individual task orders.  The firms selected are guaranteed a minimum of $5000 in fees for the base year, and a maximum of $250,000 in fees for each year of the contract,

Delivery orders are expected to include civil, agricultural, and environmental engineering services needed to design and implement elements of a CNMP. The A&E services are required to perform all aspects of the site investigation, survey, design, construction quality assurance, and final certification of conservation practices needed to implement a CNMP as part of a Farm Bill participant’s contract with NRCS.

The estimated construction costs of the proposed projects are between $10,000 and $150,000.  These IDIQ contracts could include the repair, expansion, modification, or replacement of existing systems. Services will also involve direct consultation with NRCS staff and the landowners for reviews and approvals of plans and specifications, and with construction contractors for construction quality control. Design and implementation compliance will be in accordance with NRCS-PA Section IV of the electronic Field Office Technical Guide (eFOTG), and the NRCS Agricultural Waste Management Handbook, Engineering Field Handbook, National Engineering Manual, and all other referenced publications.

<SUBJECT>J--Remotely Operated Pilot Valve for Seawater Systems
<SOLNBR>N0002405R4148
<CONTACT>Thomas Bikowski 202-781-2819
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The purpose of this announcement is to determine if there are interested sources for the replacement of solenoid-operated pilot valves (SOPV) currently in use aboard US Navy ships, or which may be used in future systems.  The valves are currently constructed in accordance NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959218, and most commonly are installed in systems depicted in NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959273.   These drawings may be referred to for an understanding of the functionality of the device, and its current mounting configuration.  Electronic copies of these drawings can be found at the Navy Logistics Library as follows: Go to:  http://www.nll.navsup.navy.mil/ Click:  PUBS/PRODUCTS/TOOLS Click:  NAVSUP DIGITAL DOCUMENTS Click:  Radio Button for NAVICP CONTRACT SUPPORT LIBRARY Click:  DOCUMENT TYPE drop down and select NAVSEA DOCUMENTS Click:  SEARCH Click:  DOCUMENT # SEA0010 Open:  Drawing 803-5959273 or Drawing 803-5959218D Note that mounting configuration and valve type shown, are not intended to indicate limitations at this point.  Instead, this information is to provide an understanding of the functionality of the device and interface connections in existing systems.  The valves must be suitable for use in a Naval combatant ship.  The valve is subject to long periods during which it is not operated, up to several months, after which it may cycle several times in a day, and then be static again for several months.  The seawater being controlled by the valve is from the ship’s firemain (normally 150 to 175 lb/in2) and contains substantial contaminants due to the coarse strainers used in these systems.  Any type of operator may be considered, such as pneumatic, hydraulic, electro-mechanical, etc.  Pneumatic or hydraulic operators would be self-contained, not requiring connection to systems other than electrical (120 or 440 VAC) and seawater.   Current areas of concern with the SOPV are leakage ! through the valve shaft seal progressing into the area of the electrical operator, electro-mechanical interface alignment and ease with which the interface comes out of alignment.  Scoring of lapped surfaces from grit has also been a concern.  As an alternative to the SOPV, direct-operated valves could replace both the SOPV’s and the valves they control, the Hycheck and Powercheck valves shown in drawing, NAVSEA No. 803-5959273.  Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead and no later than 2 May 2005, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Douglas Barylski SEA 05P4, 1333 Isaac Hull SE Mail Stop 5149, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5149.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Doug Barylski at 202-781-3612.  The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities and experience!  that relate to valve and/or mechanical device design and manufacture, brochures, top level drawings showing basic dimensions of possible devices, reliability data such as mean time between failure for proposed or similar devices, and any related information that will assist the Navy in assessing SOPV replacement possibilities.  Multiple alternatives for either future installation or backfit, or both, are welcomed.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information.  This is NOT a Request for Proposal.  The intent of this RFI is to assist the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in conducting market research to identify potential sources of Intercommunications Systems to replace the existing AN/AIC-14A Intercommunications System (ICS) in the E-2C Hawkeye.  There are five (5) AN/AIC-14A systems per E-2C aircraft.  The replacement ICS is intended to reduce aircraft operating costs, increase reliability and maintainability, improve situational awareness and increase mission effectiveness.  A U.S. Navy integration team will lead the effort to install the replacement ICS into the E-2C aircraft. Upgrades to current ICS systems as well as Non-Developmental replacement systems will be considered.

Pending future funding allocations, specific ICS functional requirements will be defined.  For purposes of this initial market request for information, prospective vendors should consider the following general performance requirements:  The replacement ICS shall operate in a carrier-based aircraft environment with an MTBF exceeding 2800 hours.  The ICS shall be a form and fit replacement of the existing AN/AIC-14A (to the greatest extent possible), interfacing with the existing communications and applicable navigation equipment.  In addition to maintaining current AN/AIC-14A capabilities, the replacement ICS shall add individual volume control and binaural capability and potential growth capability for future enhancements.  Preference is given to systems that require minimal aircraft modifications.  

This program is currently unfunded.  Future program funding status is to be determined.   However, the replacement ICS shall ensure a positive return on investment when compared to total ownership cost of the current systems.  The U.S. Navy E-2C inventory is currently 69 aircraft and is expected to remain in service through the 2025 timeframe.  

The E-2/C-2 Program Office, PMA-231, will consider alternative funding sources for this program. Some of those sources, but not necessarily all, will include applications to the Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) LECP program, similar programs sponsored by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), the OSD Reduction in Total Ownership Costs program, the NAVAIR Cost Wise Readiness Initiative program (CWRI), and the Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program. Information contained in responses to this RFI may be used to support any, all or other program initiatives. 

Responses to this RFI should include: 1) A summary outline of the performance specifications of the replacement ICS. 2) A short description of the hardware and software changes which may be required to meet E-2C unique aircraft interfaces.  3) A rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate of vendor non-recurring costs. 4) A ROM estimate of ICS unit costs.  5) Any other information at vendor discretion but limited to 5 printed pages.

Written responses to this announcement can be submitted to:

<SUBJECT>A--Level Dependent Hearing Protection Devices
<SOLNBR>W911QX05R0014
<RESPDATE>051605
<ARCHDATE>07152005
<CONTACT>Theodore Weitzman, 301-394-3165
<DESC>The US Army Research Laboratory, The Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED), is looking for White Papers to be submitted on the development of a passive in-the-ear hearing protection system with the goal of  providing soldiers with inexpen sive, non-powered, hearing protection which allows both speech communications and protection against high noise environments  in response to Topic 5.1 of the US Army Research Laboratory Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) found at http://www.aro.army.mil/resea rch/arl/fy06arlbaa.doc . Soldiers rely heavily on their hearing in combat environments.  They listen for environmental sounds, fire events, speech communications from fellow soldiers, noises which might indicate the presence or location of an enemy.  Howev er, noise levels during military operations are often at levels, which can cause temporary or permanent hearing damage, so soldiers also need to protect and preserve their hearing.  These are often conflicting requirements, as many hearing protection devic es (HPDs) do a good job preserving hearing, but at the cost of blocking sounds the soldier want to be able to hear.  Thus, soldiers typically do not wear their HPDs, as they value the immediate ability to hear more than they fear a potential hearing loss.  A potential solution for protecting hearing in military environments, yet allowing speech communications and environmental auditory monitoring, is the use of level dependent HPDs. There are two types of level dependent HPDs, one type uses electronics (act ive) to provide attenuation and the other (passive) does not use electronics to provide attenuation.  In their passive state these HPDs allow low-level sounds to pass through relatively unimpeded. When high level impulse noise (such as you would experience  during weapons firing) is present, the HPD,s protective mechanisms activate to provide robust hearing protection.  An example of a passive level-dependent HPD is the Armys Combat Arms Earplug (CAE). The CAE has two sides, the green side is responsive to continuous noise (e.g. running engine), and the yellow side is responsive to impulse noise (e.g. weapons fire). Only the yellow side of the CAE allows relatively normal speech communications. This means that the soldiers are required to perform purposeful action (removing, reversing, and reinserting the earplug) depending on their noise environment.  Reports from the battlefield, however, find that soldiers simply insert the level (yellow) dependent side to allow for speech, and do not turn it after that; t hus, they are not being protected against steady-state (continuous) noise.  So although level dependent HPDs are promising as a solution to the Armys HPD problem, the current earplug is limited and can be improved upon.  When preparing a white paper in re sponse to this announcement, the research should apply innovative research to the problem of level dependent hearing protection in military environments ands include as part of their solution:  the HPD should be an earplug; be a passive level dependent sys tem, provide sound attenuation which is dependent on the level of the sound exposure; allow soldiers to communicate via speech without shouting; provide hearing protection from steady state noise; provide hearing protection from impulse noise; not require an external power source; not require any expendable internal power sources, such as batteries; be comfortable for continuous wear under the Personal Armor System, Ground Troops (PASGT) or Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) helmets for a minimum of four hours; c ompatible for use in an Army field environment (dirt, mud, grease, water, etc., may be present; sanitation facilities may not be available).  Requirements for attenuation are to:  provide essentially equal passive attenuation across frequency bands, with a ttenuation of at least 15 dB at 250 Hz and attenuation of no more than 15 dB at 4 kHz; provide active attenuation of at least an additional 15 dB at impulse noi se levels starting at 120 dB; speech intelligibility better than 91% in continuous noise up to 100 dBA, using the Modified Rhyme Test or the Callsign Acquisition Test (CAT) to evaluate intelligibility.  Additionally, it is desired that the solution be:  ca pable of being produced in quantity for $8 per pair or less; capable of being colored in colors consistent with Army uniforms. Proposed solutions should also include the delivery of 50 pairs of a prototype inexpensive, non-powered, hearing protection devic e, compatible with the PASGT and ACH helmets, which meets the requirements for attenuation and speech communication in low noise, continuous noise, and impulse noise environments.  The prototypes must meet form, fit, and function requirements.  White paper s will be reviewed in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Offerors whose white papers appear to meet the needs described above may be invited to submit technical and cost proposals in support of their white papers.  Proposals wil l be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.   The estimated budget is $150,000; however, funding is presently not available and not guaranteed.   Costs associated with preparation and submission of white papers and/or pr oposals and/or any follow up information requests are the responsibility of the offeror and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.  It is requested that white papers in electronic format be submitted by 16 May 2005 to Ted.Weitzman@us.army.mi l .  Please be advised that .zip and .exe files cannot be accepted.  Requests for technical information / clarification should be directed to Ted Weitzman at Ted.Weitzman@us.army.mil .

<SUBJECT>R -- Title 32 Command and Control Study
<DESC>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is contemplating issuing a sole-source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to International Capitol Partners, LLC (ICP), a service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) for a Title 32 Command and Control Study.  This effort will have a period of performance of 1 year from contract award and funding is currently available.  There are no follow on efforts anticipated at this time. 

The objective of this study is to provide specialized information, options, analysis and recommendations to Assistant Secretary of Defense – Homeland Defense (ASD-HD)  on the command and control of National Guard forces in Title 32 status in Homeland Defense mission areas.  A broad range of issues will be considered, including command relationships, mission appropriateness, operational criteria and processes, policy implications and funding.  Successful performance of this study requires the ability of the contractor to coordinate, interface, interview, and gain access to the most senior officials of the Department of Defense (DoD), National Guard Bureau, State Governments and associated organizations, and possess an innate understanding of each organization’s complexities and protocols.  The Government has carefully reviewed ICP’s capabilities, experience, and key personnel and has determined that ICP is the only company that can successfully perform this task within the required timeframe.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE MAGNETO-RADAR FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL DETECTORS AND NON-METAL DETECTORS, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR)
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE MAGNETO-RADAR FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL DETECTORS AND NON-METAL DETECTORS, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES 

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more licensees to commercialize LLNL's current patents and a newly allowed, soon to be published patent covering the Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods technology.

ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS CAN BE OBTAINED AT: http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/sensor/MicropowerImpulseRadar/index.php

* The Magneto-Radar is a completely new approach to a motion and range detection sensor for conductive materials whether metal or non metal.  

* Materials may possibly be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve by detection at remote distances of very small vibrations such as from a turning fork induced in the targets. Ground balance problems are either eliminated or substantially reduced in most cases. 

* Low-cost potential applications exist in treasure hunting equipment, medical, industrial, mining, security and safety screening, and analytical equipment.  

* LLNL's licensed field disturbance technology with range gating has been the basis for other products and other applications such as range controlled radar motion sensor for security application products selling commercially for under seventy dollars ($70) in the quantity of one.

* MIR and field disturbance sensors provide range to object information while screening out clutter and discriminating from other signals due to the environment, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.

* The MIR or field disturbance sensors can detect small vibrations, such as from a tuning fork, or steel guitar strings.

* Varying frequencies and inter-modulation products of induced magnetic field targets may possibly provide more information to distinguish and identify them from other materials or movements.     

These technologies and methods relate to employing a portable, low-power, battery operated radar to sense and locate (range to object) even microscopic mechanically excited motion or vibration in objects such as but not limited to conductive and nonconductive bio-materials, including ferrous and non ferrous metals, wherein the mechanical vibration and resonance may be the result of mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, optical or electromagnetic excitation.  In many cases, the aforementioned materials can be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve. Ground balance problems are either substantially reduced by utilizing either the range gating and sensitive motion features of these technologies in combination or separately.

The MIR and field disturbance sensors are range-gated radars, which provide range to object information while screening out clutter, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.  The MIR and field disturbance sensor can be used in three capacities: (1) non-magneto, (2) magneto, or (3) contrast.  When used in the non-magneto capacity, the MIR and field disturbance sensor provides a substantially improved means of detecting stationary mechanically and/or acoustically (ex. for use in detection between walls in a building) induced vibrating and resonating objects and materials.  In the magneto capacity, the magnetically or electromagnetically induced vibration and resonance of an object can be detected via a characteristic double harmonic frequency.  Third, the radar can also detect the target object through microscopic movement resulting from changes in the size, image or contrast of the object.  

The Magneto-Radar using either LLNL's MIR or the field disturbance sensor is a completely new approach to motion and range detection sensor technology using a bipolar generator, which generates unique double harmonics detectable by MIR or the field disturbance sensor.  The MIR and field disturbance sensors are a new low-cost implementation of a pulse echo radar.  Conventional radar pulses travel at the speed of light and require an oscilloscope for high speed sweeps in even nanoseconds, but LLNL's MIR and field disturbance sensor uses a time expansion technology known as equivalent time allowing it to sweep a million times slower or on a millisecond scale. This range-gated radar operates as a pulse echo system that clocks the two way time of flight of a very short electrical pulse.  It involves using a bipolar magnetic field to induce an eddy current in the target object generating a corresponding magnetic field (detectable phase shift relied upon by traditional metal detectors for determining various materials based on conductivity), transmitting various radar frequency signals to the conductive object, receiving reflected radar signals resulting from motion in the object, and processing the receive radar signals to produce an output signal that corresponds to a harmonic and/or an inter-modulation product of the resonating target object in the magnetic field.  The MIR radar transmits short, ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses and the receiver is designed to only receive signals from a preset range(s) R.  If there are no changes within or at range R, then the integrated return signal remains constant because stationary clutter signals are integrated as part of the constant return.  However, if anything penetrates the shell, it will change the reflectivity in range R, which causes a change in the detectable return signal attributed to motion.  Through doing this as well, the varying frequencies of the induced magnetic field targets can be more readily distinguished and identified from other materials or movements through harmonic analysis.  For example, when the magnetic excitation varies sinusoidally at a frequency F, the resulting resonance of the conductive object may occur at, but is not limited to 2F, providing a unique harmonic signature that is detected by the motion sensing MIR radar (ex. a bipolar excitation frequency of 60 Hz would result in a harmonic frequency of 120 Hz).     

Since the magnetic field of a traditional metal detector must travel out to the object and then couple back to the generator, a sixth order decrease in signal strength versus range results, forming a formidable limitation in range.  In fact, it is estimated that traditional metal detectors can only detect coins and jewelry at depths of only approximately 8 inches.  In the case of the Magneto-Radar, however, induction of the target and magnetic field emanating from the target object can be obtained via use of the coil of a traditional metal detector or via a more powerful custom magnetic field generator.  The strength of the induced magnetic field is usually directly proportional to the detection range.  Significantly increased magnetic field strength can be obtained by generating short duration, high peak power, pulsed magnetic fields, even with traditional metal detector coils, without overheating the coil because of the extremely short duty cycle of the MIR or the field disturbance sensor needed to recognize movement of the target.

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ) for a firm-fixed price contract.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular and DFARS Change Notice (DCN).  This acquisition is a small business business set-aside.  The standard industrial classification code is 4212.  The NAICS code is 562119 and the size standard is $10.5 million.  The acquisition is as follows:

The 452d Flight Test Squadron/Airborne Laser Program (452 FLTS/ABL), Edwards AFB CA, produces chemical compounds necessary for testing and development.  After testing, the mixed chemical batches are returned to the Integrated Mixing Facility (IMF), where they are placed into a bulk storage tank.  The mixture, mostly composed of inorganic caustics, deionized water, and other trace elements/compounds is pH adjusted with sulfuric acid and then transferred to a 20,000-gallon holding tank, where it is evaluated for on-base management and/or off-site disposal/recycling.  Each pH-adjusted batch is between 10,000 and 20,000 gallons, generated at an average of two batches (40,000 gallons) per month, with a specific gravity between 8.9 and 9.5 (lbs/gallon), and a pH between 6 and 9.  However, depending on test success and frequency, the total monthly volume could be between 40,000 and 100,000 gallons.  Analytical evaluations have proven the waste to be Non-Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Non-California state regulated (nonhazardous) wastewater contaminated with approximately 5 percent (%) hydroxide salts, less than (<) .05% total chloride, <0.1% other trace compounds such as hydrogen peroxide and iodine, and iron from the oxidation of the holding tanks.

The requested service is for removal, transportation, and disposal/recycling of nonhazardous wastewater in minimum incremental orders for 5,000 gallon tank trucks. The government agrees that due to the higher specific gravity of this wastewater, the transporter will be required to load less than 5,000 gallons per truck in order to meet the Department of Transportation weight restriction.  The maximum volume at which the weight limit can be legally met will be considered a “full load” during the performance under this contract.  The transport tank truck shall not be contaminated with any other residual wastestreams upon delivery.  The normal response time on the order will be between 48 and 72 hours.  The government agrees that if the Service Provider (SP) is required to provide less than a 24-hour response upon order, additional charges may be applied by the SP.  The government also agrees that if the removal is delayed due to on-site originated circumstances, additional charges may be applied by the SP.

Period of performance is 12 months after date of contract.  

Qualified service providers and their proposed subcontract transporters/facilities must not have pending regulatory corrective actions and/or pending Notice of Violation(s) relating to their current permit/operational conditions or affiliated activities.  The Edwards AFB Environmental Management Office (EMO) also has the right to evaluate past violations and/or corrective actions as part of the evaluation process.  Also, qualified service providers and their proposed subcontract transporters/facilities must either be currently on the DRMS (DLA) Qualified Facilities List and/or have been audited by the Edwards AFB EMO within the past 3 years.  NOTE:  The DRMS Qualified Facilities List can be accessed at www.drms.dla.mil (Environmental/Hazardous Waste). 

The following provisions and clauses apply:  Provision 52.252-1 Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference.  This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.  (End of Provision)   Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors--Commercial; clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items; clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders--Commercial Items (to include:  52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans); clause 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration; and provision 52.212-2 Evaluation—Commercial Items, the following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:  technically acceptable lowest priced offer.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #5014. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27 dated 1/1/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 90(ninety) custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.
