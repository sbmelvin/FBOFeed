<DESC>The Mission Contracting Office, Fort Hood, Texas intends to award a firm fixed price sole-source contract to American Water (AW) for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Fort Hood Family Housing (FHFH) owned water distribution and wastewater collection system (known herein as "infrastructure") on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.   The Government intends to enter into a firm fixed price requirements with American Water Operations and Maintenance Inc., 1025 Laurel Oak Road, Voorhees, NJ 08043-3506  for a period of 6 months from 1 February 2012 through 31 July 2012.  The justification for this noncompetitive solicitation is due to a portion of the infrastructure on the installation is currently owned by a third party, the Fort Hood Family Housing known as the Residential Communities Initiative partnership (RCI). If a contract is awarded to a party other than AW, there will be significant concerns associated with having two different utility providers operating the same utility system. The NAICS code for this procurement is 221320 Sewage Treatment Facilities with a size standard of $7.0M.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES and no solicitation will be issued.   Initiating a separate competitive action for a 6-month bridge contract would not outweigh the benefits to the Government. Questions concerning this notice should be directed to Rebecca Coon via email to: rebecca.coon@us.army.mil or the Contracting Officer, at susheep.oden@us.army.mil.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY,
NAVAL MEDICAL LOGISTICS COMMAND
SYNOPSIS AND SOLICITATION

	The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to extend the period of performance on contract N62645-11-P-0039, for one month from 01 January 2012 to 31 January 2012.  With GE Healthcare, 3000 North Grandview, Waukesha, WI, 53188, as the only responsible source. GE Healthcare is the current contract holder and is the only source that can meet the applicable background check, immunization, and information security requirements before the expiration of the current contract on 31 December 2011.

GE Healthcare currently holds the contract for the service and maintenance for the installed medical equipment at NMC San Diego.
  The current contract N62645-11-P-0039 will expire on 31 December 2011, making this an urgent need for continuation.   GE Healthcare is the only vendor capable of servicing the wide array of medical equipment to OEM standards that also has the info4rmaion security, background check, and immunization requirements in place.  It is not feasible to award a competitive requirement before 01 January 2012.  However, a subsequent competitive requirement is currently being evaluated.  It is not possible to award competitive solicitation N62645RCB0007 before 01 January 2012.  Not extending the existing contract would represent a significant patient safety risk if equipment is not maintained to the appropriate OEM standards.
  

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures IAW FAR 13.5.  There are not set-aside restrictions for this requirement.  The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 811219.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product.  All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by General Electric Company Inc. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a Word or PDF attachments to Rebecca Wisner at Rebecca.Wisner@med.navy.mil.  NO PHONE CALLS ACCEPTED.

<SUBJECT>New Experimental Medicine Studies: Fast-Fail Trials in Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (FAST-MAS) 
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-DA-12-240
<RESPDATE>022312
<CONTACT>Marla Jacobson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-3775, Fax 301-443-0501, Email jacobsonmj@mail.nih.gov - Bruce E. Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email banderso@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-DA-2012-240 entitled "<strong>New Experimental Medicine Studies: Fast-Fail Trials in Mood and Anxiety Spectrum Disorders (FAST-MAS)"</strong> under Full and Open Competition. <br />
<p><br />This is a Research and Development initiative. The overall goal of this initiative is to implement an experimental medicine paradigm of "fast fail" Proof of Clinical Mechanism (POCM) and Proof of Concept (POC) trials in order to expeditiously test and analyze the molecular and/or clinical targets of novel interventions. The emphasis is upon treating clinical dimensions of psychopathology across traditional mood and anxiety spectrum disorder diagnoses (e.g., anhedonia, cognitive function, and social engagement) embedded in the current DSM diagnostic entities, but not typically identified as the primary target of current clinical therapeutics. The intent of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC) is to accelerate the pace of new discoveries by fostering research that translates findings from basic science into new treatments addressing fundamental mechanisms that cut across current diagnostic categories (see the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) webpage http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-funding/rdoc/nimh-research-domain-criteria-rdoc.shtml for more details).</p>
<p>The initiative will focus on the analyses of novel molecular and clinical targets, engaged by both new and re-purposed compounds. The outcome of this initiative is expected to lead to an enhanced understanding of underlying mechanisms and development of innovative, pharmacological treatment approaches for mood and anxiety spectrum disorders.</p>
<p>The general approach required for this initiative will be to establish a small organization of clinical trial sites and to test selected novel pharmacological interventions in adequately powered (i.e., to successfully address the primary aim/s) clinical trials (e.g., First in Human, Proof of Clinical Mechanism, Proof of Concept) in humans. Trials will be initiated after promising interventions are identified by the FAST-MAS organization, NIMH (which may include the NIMH Intramural Research Program), and outside scientific experts (as needed), and approved by the FAST-MAS Steering Committee and the NIMH Government Program Officer (GPO; sometimes also referred to as the COTR).</p>
<p>The primary objectives of resultant contract(s) are:</p>
<p>1) To expeditiously perform small-scale Phase I and/or Phase IIa clinical trials (e.g., First in Human, Proof of Clinical Mechanism, Proof of Concept) to demonstrate target engagement, safety, and early signs of efficacy of promising interventions in healthy subjects and/or a well-characterized cohort of patients with clinical dimensions of psychopathology across traditional mood and anxiety spectrum disorder diagnoses (see information regarding RDoC, above).</p>
<p>2) Depending on pilot data available for interventions selected for testing, each trial may be a single-site or multisite study with a number of subjects adequate to successfully address the primary aims (e.g., pharmacologic dose range, safety in humans, molecular and/or clinical target engagement, potential biomarkers, biological effects, early signs of efficacy) and inform a judgment whether the particular intervention warrants further evaluation. <br /><br />3) The objective of this initiative is to expeditiously perform small-scale Phase I and/or IIa clinical trials with an approximate range of 8-30 subjects per trial. The Government does not anticipate that any preclinical (i.e., Phase 0) studies or any larger scale (e.g., Phase IIb, Phase III, IV) clinical trials will be performed under this contract.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Important Considerations:<br /></strong></span><br />The offeror should also have the capability to:</p>
<p>1) Establish a small group of clinical trials sites that will focus on identifying and testing promising pharmacological interventions for the treatment of mood and anxiety spectrum disorders.<br /><br />2) Experience performing a range of clinical trials, Phase I-IIa (e.g., First in Human, Proof of Clinical Mechanism, Proof of Concept) of pharmacological clinical trials in subjects with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders.<br /><br />3) Perform multi-site clinical trials including provide scientific oversight, facilitate collaboration among the investigators, integrate complex protocol management, acquire data, analyze bio-statistical data, and report results from clinical trials involving subjects with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders.<br /><br />4) Experience obtaining access to study interventions and previous experience(s) of productive interactions with pharmaceutical companies.<br /><br />5) Appropriate capability, expertise, and equipment to assess molecular <br />and/or clinical target engagement, test clinical mechanism, and identify and validate biomarkers, using measures such as PET, fMRI, clinical electrophysiology, emotional reactivity, neurocognitive performance, and biospecimen assays.<br /><br />6) Both the Contract-PI and Site-PI(s) should have the capability to select and coordinate a team of investigators and support staff who have the capability to conduct research on the safety and efficacy of pharmacological interventions in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders, assess molecular and/or clinical target engagement using appropriate measures (e.g., PET, fMRI, clinical electrophysiology, emotional reactivity, neurocognitive performance, biospecimens assays) and identify and validate biomarkers.<br /><br />7) To function as a Coordinating Center (FAST-MAS-CC) responsible for conducting multiple concurrent trials.<br /><br />8) Access to a standing IRB with a Federalwide Assurance (FWA) from the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office for Human Research Protections.<br /><br />9) Access to a pharmacy experienced in the preparation of materials for randomized clinical trials.<br /><br />10) Appropriate staff with experience in training, following, and conducting research protocols.<br /><br />11) Adequate computing resources and support staff, including necessary electronic communication capabilities.<br /><br />12) Adequate capabilities and staff for data collection, entry, editing, electronic transfer, quality control, database management (maintaining security and accessibility), and data backup (on site and off site).<br /><br />13) Proposed Contract-PI and Site-PI(s) should be established researchers in mood and anxiety spectrum disorders and actively publishing in the field.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General information:</strong></span></p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) proposes to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. HHS-NIH-DA-2012-241 entitled <strong>"New Experimental Medicine Studies: Fast-Fail Trials in Autism Spectrum Disorders (FAST-AS)"</strong> under Full and Open Competition.<br />
<p><br />This is a Research and Development initiative. The overall goal of this initiative is to implement an experimental medicine paradigm of "fast fail" Proof of Clinical Mechanism (POCM) and Proof of Concept (POC) trials in order to expeditiously test and analyze the molecular and/or clinical targets of novel interventions.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with Oceus Networks, Inc., 1895 Preston White Drive, Ste 300, Reston, VA 20191-5449 for the procurement of the Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution (4G LTE) Afloat Expeditionary Combat Command and Control (C2) Communication System in support of NAVAIR's Counter Networks and Illicit Trafficking (CNIT) program office. A portable maritime C2 capability is critical to the continued mission success of the Counter-Piracy Task Force (CTF-151) because it provides the ability to command from a platform best suited to remain in the area of operations. Failure to provide this capability will limit the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command's ability to properly allocate limited combatants in support of national tasking and contingency operations. This procurement will also include ancillary services such as design support, installation support of this equipment on three(3) US Navy ships, one(1) aircraft and one(1) NAVAIR Surface Air Integration Laboratory (SAIL) for operational test and evaluation, operator training, and sustainment in the maritime environment. The award may include contract options.
<p>The Government intends to procure the above items under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), FAR 6.302-1. The Government does not own technical data, drawings, or other specifications to permit full and open competition. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal in writing that may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to utilize other than full and open competition to award a contract modification to the current Firm Fixed Price AN/SQQ-89 ASW Combat System Production contract with Lockheed Martin Mission Systems & Sensors (MS2), 497 Electronics Pkwy Bldg 5, Liverpool, NY 13088-6062.  This modification to contract N00024-07-C-5201 extends the award for up to two years to support FY12FY13 AN/SQQ-89(V)15 and AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 production requirements.  This effort will provide for the integration of Government Furnished Equipment Software (GFES) into all configurations of the AN/SQQ-89(V)15 and AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 Surface Ship Undersea Warfare Combat Systems.  The procurement supports the establishment of a common hardware and software baseline and will provide system capability improvements on surface combatants.
  This extension will not affect the upcoming Surface Ship Undersea Warfare (USW) Development, Integration, Manufacture, Production and Test procurement (N00024-12-R-5200).

Lockheed Martin MS2 is responsible for the hardware and software integration, test, evaluation, production/installation preparation and delivery of the AN/SQQ-89A(V)15 systems.  NAVSEA intends to award a contract modification resulting from this synopsis on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as Lockheed Martin is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge and experience of the system to meet the Government's requirement within the time required.  This announcement is published for information purposes only.
  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin directly.  

The AN/SQQ-89 program provides integrated Undersea Warfare (USW) Combat Management, Fire Control, Command, and Control, and On-Board Training to enable surface ships to engage USW targets.  The program concept embraces open-architecture methodology to expand sensor performance through the use of common software components to achieve cost effectiveness and system efficiency.  The AN/SQQ-89(V) systems are comprised of integrated subsystems that provide USW search, detection, classification, and localization for surface ships in both littoral and open ocean environments.   AN/SQQ-89(V) variants provide major capability improvements through hardware and software upgrades using an Advanced Capability Build (ACB) process.
  

Notice: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>As outlined in the Joint Cargo Unmanned Aerial Systems Concept of Operations document (attached), combat operations are conducted in a variety of environments (mountainous, desert, forest, jungle, at sea, and in urban/complex terrain) that are often characterized by rugged terrain and obstacles to ground vehicle transportation. In support of distributed operations, many Combat OutPosts (COPs) are located in obscure locations. Some missions can be conducted up to hundreds of miles from Forward Operating Bases (FOBs). The extended lines of communication between forces and their FOBs are at risk of enemy ambush or Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attack for both air and ground resupply assets.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC Pacific), intends tosolicit and award acompletion type contract, with a cost-plus-fixed-pricepricingarrangement, and a one-year period of performance, on a sole source basis toLiquid Robotics Inc. (LRI), of  1329 Moffett Park Drive, Sunnyvale CA, 94089-1134.LRI developed, at private expense, the Wave Glider.  LRI's Wave Glider is ahybrid sea-surface wave glider comprised of a submerged "glider" that isattached via a tether to a surface float. The vehicle is propelled by theconversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust, independent of wavedirection. No electrical power is generated by the propulsion mechanism.  TheLRI Wave Glider possess the following attributes: two man portable andcapable of unsupported autonomous missions of up to 10 months duration,long distance transits of up to 1000 nautical miles in the open ocean, constantsea-surface expression, solar energy harvesting during daylight hours,propulsion via wave power harvesting at all vehicle-to-wave headings,commandable vehicle heading and autonomous on-board navigation to a givenand reprogrammable lat/long waypoint on the ocean's surface, instrumentationpayloads of 20 pounds in air, power generation in support of instrumentationrequirements of 10 watts, sustained thrust adequate under own propulsionsufficient to tow loads having steady-state drag forces of 10 lbsf andtransientdrag forces of 20 lbsf, survivability in sea states up to 5 and winds to 50knots,minimal radar return, low likelihood of visual detectability, minimal radiatedacoustic noise, and available tow point greater than 12 feet below sea surface.SSC Pacific has developed the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Research Craft(SHARC) Unmand Surface Vehicle (USV) Towed Array Integrated "L" (TAIL); aspecialized passive towed acoustic array specifically tailored to LRI's WaveGlider lower unit or "glider".  SSC Pacific requires the development of acustomelectronics housing, custom umbilical cable, and logistical coordination tofurther integrate the SSC Pacific SHARC TAIL and the LRI Wave Glider. SSCPacific will also require at-sea system testing support for  the SSC PacificSHARC TAIL project in developing an autonomous acoustic sensor system.Specifically, the at-sea testing will demonstrate and validate thevehicle/sensorintegration and verify acceptable acoustic towed array performance while undertow.Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) andFAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services willsatisfy agency requirements.  LRI's technology developed at private expensemakes it the only source that would not result in the substantial additionalcostto the government.

This anticipated requirement will provide rotary wing aircraft maintenance, ground vehicle maintenance, ground support equipment maintenance, and logistical services support for the 21st Calvary Brigade (Air Combat) training mission at Main, West, and North Ft. Hood, Texas. The contract will require the maintenance of rotary wing aircraft and ground support equipment to include wheeled and tracked vehicles for the execution of unit fielding, training and certification, and unit training and deployment. In addition, the following accompanying logistical functions will be necessary to accomplish or support maintenance:  management of the supply function to include material forecasting and secondary material item procurement, electronics testing, aviation ground support repair and operation, various component repair, aeronautical support equipment maintenance, recovery of downed aircraft, fueling and refueling services, ammunition hauling and loading, Combat Aviation Training Team (CATT),and information technology services in direct support of aircraft maintenance and logistics functions.   <br><br>It is anticipated that the AFM 21st Calvary Brigade FFP contract will consist of a base year and two one year options. The base and two one year options contract will bind the successful contractors to labor rates and other factors for pricing individual options and any modifications to the contract. Options may be established as firm-fixed price for that effort that is stable as well as a FFP Level of Effort for those requirements that have a higher degree of variation in requirements will be utilized. Important note, the selected contractor must have the capability to provide responsive, timely and cost efficient maintenance and logistics type services to support the 21st Calvary Brigades training Mission.  Performance of the proposed contract is critical to the Army mission to receive, equip, train, evaluate, and deploy all of the Army's non-Fort Hood attack helicopter battalions to include the National Guard and US Allies receiving PEO managed aircraft. The anticipated contract will include DFARS 252.228-7001 Ground and Flight Risk clause. The awarded contract will support all PEO Aviation platforms and the supporting ground support equipment as required located at Fort Hood, TX. The applicable NAICS code for this effort is 488190 - Other Support Activities for Air Transportation. The small business size standard is $7M.  A size standard is the largest that a concern can be and still qualify as a small business for Federal Government programs.<br> <br>Capable Contractor Interest: The ACC - Redstone would like to identify businesses that have experience in all or a part of the requirements described above. If you believe your company is a viable source and would like to receive an announcement when the requirements are synopsized in the FedBizOpps, contact the Contracting Officer's point of contact (POC) via e-mail or in writing with your mailing or e-mail address. Note on your request if you are a large or small business as it relates to the listed NAICS code and if you are interested in the capacity of a prime or looking for subcontract opportunities. <br><br>This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Project site is located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Reservation near Richland, Washington, along the Columbia River. The site elevation varies from 662 to 684 feet above mean sea level.&nbsp; Ambient temperature range is -23 degrees F minimum to 113 degrees F maximum, with relative humidity of 5% minimum to 100% maximum.

<DESC>This is a small business Sources Sought notice for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /><br /></span>The laboratory Section on High Resolution Optical Imaging (HROI) at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) has conducted cutting-edge research into microscopy development. The lab focuses on two main areas: (1) super-resolution microscopy, i.e. imaging beneath the diffraction limit and (2) high speed volumetric imaging.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose and Project Requirements<br /></span><br />The purpose of this requirement is to provide laboratory supplies and equipment to support research in the labs two main areas: (1) super resolution microscopy and (2) high speed volumetric imaging. More specifically, the equipment will be used for two purposes.<br /><br />1) The first piece of equipment will be used for a new kind of structured illumination microscopy. Since HROI designs its own microscopes, this requires a solid foundation (base) upon which to mount all other optics, mechanics, and electrical elements. As the anticipated resolution gains will be in the ~100 nm regime, controlling mechanical and thermal drift is of critical importance. The system must be made from invar, a material with an extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion. Thus, it will be far less prone to thermal drift than other alloys and metals commonly used in microscopy bases (i.e. Aluminum). This material is optimally suited to super-resolution experiments.
<p><br />2) The HROI laboratory recently designed an inverted plane illumination microscope (SPIM) for high speed volumetric imaging of living samples, such as worm embryos (Wu et. al. PNAS 108 17708-17713 (2011)). This device employs a custom-built mount that houses two perpendicular objectives for exciting the sample and recording fluorescence. Importantly, no commercial base for SPIM exists, and the HROI laboratory designs its own from various parts. The system must be designed to serve as a base for a next generation SPIM device. The use of this base is required, as it provides piezoelectric devices, stages, and mechanics designed to work with the current systems parts and specifications. <br /><br />These two bases will enhance and enable capabilities currently lacking from the current equipment. Specifically:</p>
<p>1) The existing super-resolution system consists of several objectives, lasers, mirrors, lenses, and optomechanics. A system with an INVAR base will enable these components to be mounted in the correct orientation with respect to each other and therefore can be used as a functional microscope. Furthermore, a base without INVAR would lead to unacceptable thermal drift, causing the components to move too much for super-resolution measurements.</p>
<p>2) The existing SPIM system consists of two objectives, a right-side objective mount, and lenses and lasers. Like the super-resolution system, these components must have a base that meets the design specifications for integration of the right-side objective mount with the rest of the optical system, and is necessary for a complete microscope. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anticipated delivery date<br /></span><br />The anticipated delivery date is 45 days from the date of award.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disclaimer and Important Notes<br /></span><br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.

<SOLNBR>N68335-12-T-0069
<RESPDATE>012312
<CONTACT>LeAnn S. Wardell, Contract Specialist, Phone 7323231682, Fax 7323237440, Email leann.wardell@navy.mil
<DESC><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) in regards to a NAVAIR (AIR 4.4.2) requirement to upgrade a test cell used for the test and evaluation of aviation turbine lubricants to maintain the Department of Defense Qualified Products List for aviation turbine lubricants. NAVAIR (AIR 4.4.2) seeks potential sources and information on the potential source's knowledge, skill and experiences in test cell testing technology and testing equipment and instrumentation installation. This RFI is for planning purposes and information only and should not be construed as a solicitation for applications or an obligation on the part of the government.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The current Lubricant Test System (LTS) consists of an Allison Engine Company M250-C18 turbo shaft engine, a water brake for power absorption and a lubricant conditioning system. Control of the engine, water brake and lubricant system are done in a separate control room approximate 50 feet from the engine test cell. A programmable logic controller, data acquisition system and displays in the control room are utilized to set engine and lubricant test conditions, monitor and record test data. It has been approximately 35 years since the LTS was last up-graded.

<a href="mailto:JOSEPH.CALTAGIRONE@NAVY.MIL">JOSEPH.CALTAGIRONE@NAVY.MIL</a>
<DESC>NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office is issuing a request for information (RFI) seeking sources to provide an alternative Card Accepting Device (CAD) for vending machines used aboard Navy ships.  This announcement is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  THIS RFI IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTES PROPOSALS AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.  Responses to the RFI will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

Cashless vending machines (soda/snack/stamp) are currently deployed aboard U.S.
 Navy ships and accept a specific bank card containing an Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC) with a stored value e-purse.  The Navy is requesting information to determine if alternative CAD devices are available with barcode scanners.  The desired cards to be used in the future will contain a linear and 2D barcode.  Navy personnel will already have these cards.  

The barcode-reading CAD should essentially be an off-the-shelf, commercially available unit that with minimal modifications can be easily swapped for the present ICC-reading CAD.  Navy would not be seeking a lengthy development or modification process that would be required to make a barcode-reading CAD compatible with our ships vending architecture.
  The barcode-reading CAD must be a modular unit that the Navy AIT contractor will install into existing vending machines to replace the current ICC-reading CAD.  The new CAD must be compatible with the current physical characteristics regarding size, shape, and power/data connections.  Please refer to the attached CAD specification, which describes the present requirements.

The purpose of the card read will be only to obtain the identity of the card holder and to associate it with the purchase value of the vending selection.  The identity information read by the CAD, and the purchase value, will be provided in electronic format.  The identity and purchase data will be passed electronically via the ships network.
  As long as the CAD is online each purchase will be passed to the server at the time of sale.  If the CAD is not online, the identification and purchase information will be stored in the CAD and passed to the server when the CAD does come back online.

THIS RFI PERTAINS ONLY TO THE CAD HARDWARE; CARDS ARE NOT A PART OF THIS RFI.  RFI respondents should assume that they will collect the purchase and identification data that the CAD acquires and be capable of passing those data in a format to be determined by the Navy.  Navy expects that their own developer will be responsible for accepting the purchase and identification data and handling it from there.

All responding sources shall provide a summary of company capabilities including organization name, address, point of contract (including phone number and e-mail address), business size, DUNS number, CAGE Code, and past experience.
  Responses should also provide a list of how many devices are installed, type of warranty/support is provided, specific types of vending supported (i.e. snacks, drinks, frozen, etc.), and price examples based on the units installed.  The NAICs code for this acquisition is 454210 and the size standard is $10M.All submissions are required to be submitted via e-mail to joseph.caltagirone@navy.mil no later than 3pm (Eastern Standard Time) on 06 January 2012. Please direct any questions concerning this sources sought synopsis to Joseph Caltagirone at 215-697-9687, or joseph.caltagirone@navy.mil.

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) 
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"



1.	Contracting Activity:   Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC), 3710 SW U.S. Veterans Hospital Road, Portland, OR, 97239.


2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This procurement under PR # 648-12-1-6999-0001, Contract # VA260-12-P-0135 is for assisted parking services, where in accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, in accordance with (IAW) the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.  This will be a new firm-fixed-price contract action.


3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  PVAMC has a requirement to park an additional 100 employee vehicles at the Portland campus.  This is due to the closure of surface parking Lot #13 (77 parking spaces) which is undergoing construction to become a parking structure.  In addition to the existing striped parking stalls at the campus, the contractor shall direct employees to park an additional 100 vehicles at the PVAMC main campus.  Assisted parking is intended for VA employees only.  The contractor will not park patient, visitors, and volunteers.

The total estimated value of this acquisition is $108,000.00.  This is for a two month base and eight months option.

The period of performance is 14 November 2011 - 31 December 2012.  


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:  The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is urgency.  The requirement was not synopsized IAW FAR 5.101 due to urgency.  


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  The contractor that was currently performing the work, Daja International, is citing bankruptcy and is going out of business.  The period of performance was awarded for 1 May 2011 - June 2012.  Daja International provided notice, to the contracting office and service line, that they would no longer provide services the same day (Nov. 4, 2011) that services were discontinued. The new procurement request (transaction number 648-12-1-6999-000) was received in contracting on 4 November 2011, with a new contract required to be in place by 13 November.  Due to a short week and Veteran's Day holiday weekend, a three day window was the only time allowed for to secure a new contractor.  





6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:  The requirement was not synopsized IAW FAR 5.101 due to urgency.  Though formal competition was not sought by means of posting to FedBizOpps, the service line and contract specialist conducted brief market research in an effort to obtain quotes.  Market research showed two other potential vendors, in addition to the known vendor, that may be capable of providing the required services.   One of the vendors was not found in CCR, and therefore, was not pursued for a quote.  Star Park, LLC was found to be in CCR and was contacted with a request to provide a quote.   A walk through was quickly planned for Tuesday, November 8th, at 9:00am.   Star Park, LLC and Ameritac, Inc. were notified of the date/time/location of the walk through.  Star Park, LLC was the only attendee at the walk through.  Quotes were received from Star Park, LLC and Ameritac, Inc. A verbal order was given on 9 November to Star Park, LLC.  


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:  The anticipated total dollar amount of the proposed acquisition is $108,000.00 (quote from Star Park, LLC).  This is based on a two-month base period of $20,000.00 and an additional eight month option of $11,000.00 for each month.   The IGE is $121,310.00.  The quote received form Ameritac, Inc. was for $114,344.  Based on this data, the price is found to be fair and reasonable.


8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10): The service line point of contact and the contract specialist conducted brief market research in an effort to obtain quotes.  Market research showed two other potential vendors, in addition to the known vendor, that may be capable of providing the required services.   One of the vendors was not found in CCR, and therefore, was not pursued for a quote.  Star Park, LLC was found to be in CCR and was contacted with a request to provide a quote.   A walk through was quickly planned for Tuesday, November 8th, at 9:00am.   Star Park, LLC and Ameritac, Inc. were notified of the date/time/location of the walk through.  Star Park, LLC was the only attendee at the walk through.  Quotes were received from Star Park, LLC and Ameritac, Inc. 


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition: None.


10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: None.


11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required: None.  It is anticipated that this service will not be necessary after August 2012.

 
12.	 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c):

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p>52.252-6 Authorized Deviations in Clauses</p>
<p>(a) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR Chapter 1) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the date of the clause.<br />(b) The use in this solicitation or contract of any Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR Chapter 2) clause with an authorized deviation is indicated by the addition of "(DEVIATION)" after the name of the regulation.<br />WAWF INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p>To be eligible for contract awards from this organization, you must now use an E-invoicing system called Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF). WAWF is a web-based tool used to electronically process invoices and receiving reports. It is one of three E-Invoicing options identified in DFARS 252.232-7003, but is considered the "preferred" E-Invoicing solution within DoD. WAWF enables pre-population of data, data sharing, improved data accuracy, decreased redundant data entry, decreased lost or misplaced documents, and online access to contracts and related records. Email addresses, along with routing and location codes contained in the contract, are used to enable document access and alert users of pending document actions and status. Contractors benefit via increased cash flow and the DoD benefits via reduced interest penalty payments. <br />To gain access to the WAWF production system, contractors must acquire an account for their company and register their employees to use the system. There is no charge to register for or to use WAWF. Registration instructions and online training are available at www.wawftraining.eb.mil. Contractors must possess a Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, maintain a current registration in the Contractor Central Registration database and identify an Electronic Business Point of Contact. <br />For security purposes, WAWF user identity is assured via Public Key Infrastructure authentication methods which enable structured user IDs, secure passwords and/or digital certificate capability. Documents are verified via digital signature and transmissions are processed with secure audit capability. A review of the online training module "Determine Type of Document to Create" under Vendor Training at www.wawftraining.eb.mil is recommended. Questions on WAWF may be directed to the WAWF Help Desk (available 24/7) at 866-618-5988. <br />For your contract, the following data elements will be required to create and route your WAWF documents correctly: <br />-Contract and/or Delivery Order Number <br />-CAGE Code <br />-Issue Date <br />-Issue By DoDAAC <br />-Admin DoDAAC <br />-Inspect By DoDAAC <br />-Service Acceptor DODAAC <br />-Ship To Code (DoDAAC or CAGE Code) <br />-Local Processing Office (LPO) DoDAAC*<br />-Pay DoDAAC</p>

<DESC>USAID/South Africa Regional Financial Management Office (RFMO) a) provides financial services to three non-presence countries that includes Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana; and five presence countries in southern Africa, including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Angola, Madagascar, and Namibia; b) oversees the respective financial management staffs in each country; c) manages and/or reviews the operating expense and consolidated support budgets for the respective countries; and d) supports USAID's technical and development programs as well as the Ambassador's Self-Help, Development Credit, Food For Peace (FFP), Office of Foreign Disaster Administration (OFDA) and President's Emergency Plan For Aids Relief (PEPFAR) programs. The RFMO provides accounting, funds control, audit management, financial analysis, budgeting, payment processing, technical guidance, and staffing coverage to its client missions. This is a challenging position as the selected individual(s) will be responsible for training and mentoring accountants, accounting technicians, financial analysts, and voucher examiners in South Africa and the client missions. The incumbent will train the accountants and accounting technicians in funds control, accounting, and support budgets, train the financial analysts in financial management and program funding, and train the voucher examiners in payment processing. Many members of the financial management staff of USAID have less than two years with USAID and the USG and need in-depth mentoring in order to undertake their full roles and responsibilities. As a result, RFMO and its client missions have not been completing assigned duties and responsibilities on a timely basis. Thus, it is estimated that the incumbent will spend 80% of his/her time in providing on-the-job training and direction to the accountants, financial analyst and voucher examiners in budgeting, accounting , reporting, reconciliation and analysis and responsibilities for voucher processing, and 20% of his/her time providing technical assistance to the technical teams.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

001.	Provide readjustment counseling services for San Joaquin and Tuolumne counties. Contractor will service approx. 150-200 veterans, 35-40 hours a week.  	980	
$_____________
Scope of Work:  	

1.	Contractor will be required to provide readjustment counseling services to Veterans and eligible Beneficiaries in San Joaquin and Tuolumne Counties in connection with the Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center, Modesto, CA.  Recommended place of facility should be in Sonora, CA.

2.	Contractor will be required to provide a service delivery mechanism, emphasizing and understanding the readjustment problems of veterans who served during World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Vietnam Era non-Theater (if previously a client of the Vet Center program), Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, Persian Gulf, Somalia, Kosovo/Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan and Post-Vietnam Armed Conflict Zones, and the provisions of counseling services specifically tailored for such problem, in a relatively unstructured, client oriented setting, located outside existing Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) facilities.

3.	A counseling session or initial assessment shall last a minimum of 45 minutes and will be deemed a single visit.  Longer visits will be deemed as single visits regardless of length.  A maximum of three assessment visits will be authorized initially by the Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center referrer.  A maximum of up to fifteen visits can be authorized for additional treatment after the initial assessment has been completed.

4.	Group counseling, for reimbursement purposes, shall be 90 minutes in length.  Participation in a group counseling session constitutes one visit regardless of length beyond 90 minutes.

5.	Readjustment counseling, for the purpose of this contract, is counseling provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other counselors, individually or in groups specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral problems that bear a distinct relationship to the process of readjustment from military duty to civilian life.

6.	The group of individuals eligible to receive readjustment counseling services include War Zone Veterans - all eras, including but not limited to:

a.	World War II - 		(three eligible categories)
b.	Korean War		June 27, 1950, through July 1954
c.	Vietnam War		February 28, 1961 through May 7, 1975
d.	Lebanon		August 25, 1982, through February 26, 1984
e.	Grenada		October 23, 1983, through November 21, 1983

g.	Persian Gulf		August 2, 1990, to present
h.	Somalia		September 5, 1992, to present
i.	Kosovo/Bosnia		November 20, 1995, to present
j.	Iraq/Afghanistan	April 1, 2003 to present

7.	Services furnished under this program may, if determined by DVA to be essential to the effective readjustment of the Veteran, be furnished to family members and others having a significant relationship with the veteran.  An individual with other than honorable discharge may also be eligible for readjustment counseling as determined by the Vet Center.

8.	Service initiation under this contract will be through referral only.  Only Vet Center Staff (Team Leader), Regional Managers, and Chief of staff or designee at the DVA may make referrals to a contractor.  The number, type and frequency of counseling services to the veterans and significant others (i.e., members of the veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live) can be provided only as authorized by the referring DVA and Vet center staff members.  Significant others could be seen conjointly with veteran in couple or family counseling by contract provider.

9.	Services to significant others under this contract will be initiated only on the basis of authorization from Vet Center staff or Medical Center mental health professional staff, (psychiatrists, psychologist, social worker, or a psychiatric nurse clinical specialist) at the DVA.  All referrals made by DVA Mental health professionals who are not Vet Center Staff, will be closely coordinated with the Vet Center Team Leader/Contracting Officers' Technical Representative (COTR), as the latter will assume responsibility for monitoring the case once the referral is made.  Upon determination of eligibility and completion of assessment that determines the need for readjustment counseling services, a referral will be made by completion of VA Form 10-5565b, Veterans Outreach Program Contract Services Authorization.  The completion and disposition of VA Form 10-5565b is to be implemented according to the instructions on the form.

10.	Contractor will not be required to provide general mental health services, but only readjustment counseling for the problems that bear a distinct and crucial relation to readjustment from military duty, for example:

a.	Psychosocial problems related to exposure to war trauma.
b.	Other aspects of duty in the Southeast Asia combat zone, or other zones previously cited.
c.	Post-traumatic stress disorder
d.	Stresses unique to military duty during conflicts.
e.	Psychological concern over a possible service connected condition
f.	Psychosocial problems related to substance abuse clinically associated with military duty or post-military readjustment
g.	Post combat zone experiences to include homecoming and re-entry experiences.
h.	Post military discharge environmental stressors exacerbating the effects of military duty stressors.
i.	Psychological concern over possible exposure to chemical and/or biological agents in the war-zone.
j.	Generalized alienation from society manifested by interruption of normal readjustment processes.
k.	Psychosocial problems about type of military discharge other than dishonorable.
l.	Financial difficulties created by the loss of income as a result of active duty service.
m.	Difficulties created by the reversal of roles within the marriage as a result of the active duty service of one or both member of the marital couple.
n.	Psychological stress upon the marriage created due to the disability incurred by one of the marital partners as a result of the active duty service.

11.	Contractor shall schedule the initial veteran's counseling session within five (5) working days from the time he/she receive the authorization (VA Form 10-5565b).

12.	Contractor will maintain counseling records that comply with the Privacy Act and will be accurate and complete.  Format for counseling record will be provided.  Contractor will ensure the physical security of records and prevention of disclosure of the records, reports, or other private information of clients except with the clients' informed written consent.  Counseling records shall mirror Vet Center charts and are considered the property of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.    One year following the termination of the contract, the contractor shall turn the client folder over to the authorizing Vet Center.

13.	Contractor shall provide in writing an initial comprehensive psychosocial assessment to the COTR no later than the completion of three (3) initial visits.  An updated counseling plan will be submitted to the COTR one (1) week prior to completion of each authorized block of visits thereafter which addresses continuing need for readjustment counseling.

14.	Determination of adequacy of counseling plans will be based on the professional judgment of the DVA referrer in each case.  At the completion of each counseling session or group, the contractor will document on the appropriate form the name of veteran or client, as well as length, date, and specific type of counseling session.  This verification form will be filled in by the contractor and presented to the veteran or client for his/her signature.  A separate verification form is to be completed for each veteran for each month, and attached to the monthly bill submitted to the Vet Center.

15.	Contractors will be required to have veteran sign required verification form for each session of readjustment counseling and will attach to invoices when submitted for payment.  At the time services are rendered, the contractor will secure a signed acknowledgment of services from each client and for each visit for which they are billing the Department of Veterans Affairs Vet Center (DVA).  Contractor shall list the names of the clients, and also indicate the type of counseling provided.

16.	While the provision for medications and physical examinations are not considered a component of readjustment counseling services, and will not be provided under this contract mechanism, offerors must have the capability to arrange for, through referral, physical assessments and medical treatment and therapy or to provide such services directly.

17.	Contractor shall advise all veterans where applicable that the DVA will not reimburse them through this program for physical examinations, drugs, or other medical treatments.  DVA will provide medical care where appropriate to eligible veterans within the limits of this Medical Center.

18.	As it is impossible to determine the exact number of counseling sessions that will be required during the contract term, each provider whose proposal is accepted wholly or in part will be required to deliver all articles or services that may be ordered during the contract term, except as he/she otherwise indicates in his/her proposal and except as otherwise provided herein.

19.	Proposals offering less than 85% of the estimated number of needed counseling sessions or which provide that the Government shall guarantee any specific number of counseling sessions, will not be considered.  The fact that the number of counseling sessions are estimated shall not relieve the contractor from providing all services placed under this contract.  There will be absolutely no formal or informal guarantee of quantities provided in or throughout the duration of the contract, by any individual.

20.	Contracts will only be entered into by the DVA that are based on a rate schedule (amount charged by provider for each client visit) which falls within the range of usual and customary fees for the specific geographical area in which services are provided.  In determining the appropriate fee range, it should be noted that different usual and customary fees prevail for different types of therapy; i.e., individual, group, family, and professional discipline.

21.	A site visit shall be made to the contractor's facility prior to award by a DVA team.  After award, Team Leader will be authorized on-site inspection of contract provider facilities on an annual basis or as needed to respond to any clinical concerns or problems that develop during the term of the contract.

22.	A post-award orientation shall be held with all involved parties at the DVA to respond to any questions and provide clarification as necessary.

23.	In accordance with DVA requirements, the Contracting Officer shall provide a Contracting Officers' Technical Representative (COTR) and an alternate COTR for technical supervision of the contract.  The contractor will be provided a copy of the Delegation of Authority.

24.	The DVA may make changes to forms, time frames, number of visits, etc., as directed by VA Regional or Central Offices.  Should this occur, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer and COTR at the time the information is received.

25.	Contractors' facility shall be adequate to meet the criteria for providing services to the veterans; physical floor plan to include private/confidential group and individual counseling areas.  Contractors' counseling areas shall be easily accessible to the physically challenged.

26.	Contractor shall insure that all client appointment books, charts, and client related information are locked in a secure location.

27.	Contractor is required to report and submit for approval, any proposed changes in personnel providing services under this contract to the Contracting Officer through the COTR.  All providers under the contract will be listed along with their reimbursement rates for each type of service.

28.	Contractor shall insure that the initial counseling session is scheduled within five (5) working days from the date the contractor receives the VA Form 10-5565b authorizing visits.

29.	Contractor will be required to submit initial assessments/counseling, updated counseling plans, and Veterans DD214, to the COTR one (1) week prior to scheduling the next block of visits.  Contractor will insure that all client records are maintained in a structured format and contain assessment/counseling plans.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OFDA/OD). The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to the complex emergency in Pakistan, OFDA operates an office headquartered at the USAID Mission in Islamabad, Pakistan which is responsible for overseeing the $112 million portfolio of OFDA funding in Pakistan during fiscal year 2011. The Senior Program Officer is OFDA's principal humanitarian representative in Pakistan and is located in Islamabad. The Senior Program Officer will be responsible for monitoring OFDA programs and reporting on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan. The Senior Program Officer assists the Principal Regional Advisor with assessment and monitoring of existing or evolving crises, maintenance of partner relationship, and facilitation of award management activities.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for South Asia. Under the guidance of the PRA, he/she will coordinate closely with USAID and Embassy staff and exchange information regularly with colleagues covering Pakistan portfolios, as well as with the field and headquarters-based OFDA regional team. This includes sharing project ideas, strategies, and soliciting advice and guidance. The Senior Program Officer will also work closely with the Agreement Officer's Technical Representative or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for all assigned awards. He/she may supervise up to two Foreign Service Nationals.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of one Senior Program Officer to more effectively monitor OFDA programs and the humanitarian situation in Pakistan.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The OFDA Senior Program Officer will primarily provide full time in-country coordination and management of the humanitarian emergency and disaster risk reduction efforts throughout the area of responsibility (AOR). The Senior Program Officer may assist in humanitarian assistance activities in the region as needed.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial daily coordination with several OFDA staff members, as well as with representatives from other USAID offices, Embassy staff, and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Program Officer must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines. The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. government disaster assessment team, DART, RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.</p>
<p>The Senior Program Officer's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as one of the principal contact points for OFDA in Pakistan, for humanitarian issues. Coordinate closely with both field and headquarters-based components of OFDA's Regional Team and maintain regular contact with development assistance colleagues in the USAID Mission and/or US Embassy.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve a primary role in the development of OFDA's response and disaster risk reduction strategies in the AOR, ensure complementarity between the two strategies, and oversee implementation of each.</p>
<p>&bull; Assess a broad spectrum of emergency conditions to provide recommendations, management oversight, and evaluation of OFDA response programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain regular contact with senior leadership within the humanitarian community and represent USAID and OFDA on humanitarian issues. This will include but is not limited to UN agencies, IOs, and NGOs, U.S. Government personnel, donors, host government authorities, and others on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Travel frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor humanitarian conditions in the AOR, and make strategic recommendations for appropriate interventions.</p>
<p>&bull; Participate in and report on joint donor humanitarian evaluations and UN-led assessments, and participate actively in the international community response structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide regular reporting, through official cables and other means, on issues related to the humanitarian situation in the AOR. Provide overviews of patterns and trends in the humanitarian situation and keep the Regional Coordinator and other support staff current on response issues. Provide regular reports on site visits, meetings, general atmospherics and other issues that impact humanitarian relief efforts.</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Manage all administrative functions at the field office level and coordinate travel for all humanitarian-related visitors, including VIPs.</p>
<p>&bull; Prepare agendas and briefings for official U.S. Government visitors interested in humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Program Officer will report to OFDA's Principal Regional Advisor for South Asia, located in Bangkok, Thailand, and maintain close coordination with the Disaster Operations Specialist in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative direction in terms of broadly defined goals and objectives. The incumbent is expected to take initiative and act independently with minimal direction and will exercise independent judgment in responding to humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OFDA/OD). The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs), including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The January 2005 signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the Government of the Republic of the Sudan and the southern-based Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) officially ended more than two decades of north-south conflict during which famine, fighting, and disease killed an estimated 2 million people and displaced at least 4.5 million others. The CPA gave legitimacy to the two major parties-now sharing power in a Government of National Unity (GNU)-and contained a proviso for Southern Sudan to conduct a referendum on self-determination on January 9, 2011. The referendum in January 2011 resulted in a vote for independence. As a result, the Republic of South Sudan officially became an independent country on July 9, 2011. Between the signing of the peace agreement in 2005 and November 2010, more than two million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and 330,000 refugees returned to their communities in Southern Sudan and the Three Areas located between northern and Southern Sudan, according to the International Organization for Migration and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</p>
<p>Populations continue to return from northern Sudan to the ten states of Southern Sudan and the Three Areas of Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei Area. Returns have continued at a steady but slow pace since late January 2011 following the referendum, relative to the high rate between the end of October 2010 and the beginning of January. Nearly 350,000 people returned to Southern Sudan and the Three Areas between October 30, 2010 and May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government (USG) remains the leading international donor to Sudan, contributing nearly $5.1 billion for humanitarian programs in Sudan and eastern Chad since FY 2004. In FY 2011, the USG continued to support the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>USAID/OFDA requires the services of a Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Juba, South Sudan to ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster assistance, risk reduction, strategic reporting, interagency coordination, and situational analysis are met in the ongoing response.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This position requires an individual who is able to reside in Juba, South Sudan, as determined in consultation with the Embassy and the Mission and subject to security and programmatic considerations. It also requires willingness to travel outside of Juba on short notice for possibly an extended period of time. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for OFDA's ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in South Sudan, as well as for disaster risk reduction programs. The incumbent will work closely with the USAID/South Sudan Mission, the US Embassy, other U.S. Agencies as appropriate, IOs, NGOs, and the UN, to respond to humanitarian needs and sudden onset disasters. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will be responsible for program analysis, program monitoring, oversight of program implementation, as well as reporting to OFDA East and Central Africa Regional Office (ECARO) in Nairobi, Kenya, OFDA Washington, and USAID/South Sudan and U.S. Embassy/South Sudan, as required.</p>
<p>This position requires substantial coordination with representatives from other USAID offices, the US Embassy, other U.S. Government (USG) agencies, the Republic of South Sudan (ROSS), U.S. military representatives, as well as with relevant UN and NGOs, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.</p>
<p>Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the OFDA Principal Regional Advisor (PRA) for East and Central Africa and in consultation with USAID/South Sudan, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the principal point of contact for OFDA in South Sudan for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the USAID mission, U.S. Embassy and other U.S Agencies, military representatives, OFDA/Washington and the overall humanitarian community.<br />&bull; Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements and target beneficiary groups and locations, and existing relief and reintegration programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary to support OFDA-funded programs in South Sudan. <br />&bull; Supervise relevant U.S. Personal Services Contractors and foreign national program staff within the Juba OFDA Program Office.<br />&bull; Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance efforts in South Sudan. Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with OFDA/ECARO and OFDA/Sudan on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated field feedback to the partners.<br />&bull; Coordinate collection of information and provide updates and recommendations through written reports on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:<br />o Capacity and level of activity of local institutions to carry out relief programs;<br />o Capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;<br />o Capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;<br />o Security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;<br />o Impact of ROSS activities on humanitarian programs; <br />o Contributions by other donors, problems arising from implementation of relief and reintegration programs, and any other issues that require the attention of OFDA; and <br />o Humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.<br />&bull; Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting; review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO.<br />&bull; Present OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to reintegration and humanitarian protection. Work closely with the PRA to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.<br />&bull; Visit OFDA-funded projects, and report on a timely basis to OFDA/Washington and OFDA/ECARO on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes, and evolving operational conditions. <br />&bull; Represent USG humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.<br />&bull; Maintain regular liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the ROSS, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.<br />&bull; Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington, as necessary. <br />&bull; Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as reintegration, humanitarian protection and coordination.<br />&bull; Submit situation reports and assessment reports whenever necessary, including monthly official reporting cables or as the situation warrants.<br />&bull; Have the ability to operate standard field communications equipment; may be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Humanitarian Advisor will report directly to the OFDA PRA for ECARO. However, for many activities, the Senior Humanitarian Advisor will coordinate tasks directly with personnel within USAID/South Sudan, and in collaboration and consultation with other USAID and U.S. Embassy staff. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor does not have the authority to commit OFDA resources without approval from the OFDA/ECARO PRA and OFDA/Washington. <br /><br />SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The Senior Humanitarian Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The OFDA PRA for ECARO will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Program Office provides OTI with strategic guidance on country-level and office-level budgeting, strategy, and program performance issues, and increases key stakeholder awareness of and support for OTI as a key instrument in carrying out U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Program Office maintains technical oversight of the Support Which Implements Fast Transitions (SWIFT) IQC and the Programming Development Quickly (PDQ) IQC, and manages coordination of programming within the Foreign Assistance (F) framework. The Program Office plays a key role in the initial country assessment process, periodic country program and management reviews, and final evaluations. The Program Office also provides support to ongoing country programs through managing country budgeting decisions and allocation of resources, and setting standards and providing guidance on strategic planning, decision-making, and implementation. In addition, the Program Office provides reports on country activities for DCHA, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Department of State, and Congress.</p>
<p>The Program Office serves as a central processing point for budgetary and programmatic information, and also provides guidance and standardization of OTI and Agency-wide policies and regulations. The Program Office has regular interaction with country program teams, and reports directly to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The Program Office supports country program operations through improved strategic thinking, planning, and decision-making; instituting strategic budgeting; facilitating the design and procurement of new implementation mechanisms; and strengthening reporting, communications and outreach.</p>
<p>The Senior Management Advisor is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program procurement and operations for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in the field, and also in the U.S. The Senior Management Advisor provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and expertise. This individual must be readily available to provide the required services on an intermittent basis, often on short notice with little time for preparation. OTI field offices are located in countries with complex problems, often in difficult and harsh environments, with some offices located in countries with no other USAID presence. The Senior Management Advisor reports to the Program Office Team Leader or his or her designee, and spends the majority of his or her time supporting OTI country program implementation teams in the Field and in Washington. All of the field activities supported and the majority of the headquarters activities supported are transition program implementation-focused.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide a Senior Management Advisor to the Office of Transition Initiatives.</p>

<p>&bull; At times, be available as a resource for other USAID offices or USG agencies when the work corresponds with the incumbent's experience, the scope of work, and with the clearance of the Supervisor and Office Director;</p>
<p>&bull; Review all OTI current and planned procurement processes supporting country program activities, including Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC), Purchase Orders, Cooperative Agreements, and Small Business IQCs to determine current capabilities and to recommend changes and modifications that will improve effectiveness of procurement planning for country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) and, when necessary, with USAID field Missions to ensure that adequate analysis of procurement issues has been conducted and that appropriate solutions are supported by Agency and U.S. government contracting regulations;<br /><br />&bull; Advise on the initiation of new procurement mechanisms, including indefinite quantity contracts, cooperative agreements, purchase orders, or other procurement formats that will support OTI country program work, and will ensure that the U.S. government may utilize the most cost-effective procurement mechanisms that are appropriate for individualized situations and country program needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise on, and if necessary coordinate, procurement activities and issues between OTI and OAA and Missions in the field, implementing partners, as well as DCHA, USAID geographic bureaus, the Bureau for Policy, Planning and Learning, and Management Bureau on occasion;</p>

<p>&bull; Develop relationships with USAID Mission senior management to ensure that OTI acquisition and assistance strategic planning and new initiatives related to OTI country programming are in sync with existing and new procurement policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and provide training modules and products for headquarters and field staff (both U.S. and foreign national as well as implementing partner staff) as needed to ensure that OTI staff have a full understanding of all Agency procurement procedures and regulations affecting their work;</p>
<p>&bull; Determine or define mechanisms and levels of procurement and program support for OTI Field Teams;</p>
<p>&bull; As needed, advise OTI managers on OTI and Agency procurement policies and issues and advise OTI country program staff on agency policies and regulations relating to procurement in a multitude of contexts;</p>
<p>&bull; Take initiative, act independently, and manage tasks with minimal supervision. Work with supervisor to develop deadlines, projects and work to be accomplished. Supervisor will set overall objectives.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<CONTACT>Andre D. White, Phone 9375224540, Email andre.white@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Solicitation is amended to require submission of a capabilities package and price list. The preferred method of delivery of the proposal is by email to the Primary Point of Contact, Andre White, andre.white@wpafb.af.mil, however, physical hard copies of the proposal will also be accepted and must be delivered prior to the Solicitation deadline. This amendment will also incorporate a revised Performance Work Statement, dated 22 December 2011 which Contractors must adhere to and extends the Solicitation deadline to 12 January 2012.</p>
<p>The Air Force has received questions regarding this Solicitation and would like to address those questions with responses for any vendor interested.</p>
<p>1. The amount of information requested precludes any type of easy electronic transmission of a response, so I assume a physical delivery of an electronic copy of the material is warranted.<br />a. Email would be the preferred method of delivery of the electronic information. If there is another method you would prefer, please let me know and we can work out the receipt of your proposal.<br /><br />2. A copy of an example electronic report is requested, but it's unclear whether the requested report be an electronic hardcopy or an electronic format suitable for upload into the USAFSAM/OEHTA LIMs. If the upload electronic version is wanted we would need to have a copy of the valid values and any other required data report specifications be sent to either be able to provide an uploadable example or give an accurate estimate of the time needed to do so. <br />a. The report should be submitted in an electronic format suitable for upload into the USAFSAM/OEHTA LIMs as prescribed in the attached document entitled Electronic Data Deliverable (EDD) File Format. If a report is not submitted with the proposal, a statement identifying the time frame required by the contractor (number of weeks, days, etc) to develop electronic data deliverables (EDD) should be included. Prior to receiving work on this BPA, the contractor will provide proof demonstrating the capability of creating electronic data deliverables (EDD).</p>
<p>3. You've also requested an example report for each "area of interest" Does each tab in the Excel price table denote an area of interest? May the lab pick one specific analytical procedure in each tab for its example report? <br />a. "Area of interest" is defined broadly. If a sample report covers all the areas they are reporting then one (1) report would be fine. However, if their radiochemistry lab or subcontractor has a different format then we would like to see that, as well. The same would be for Drinking Water versus IH, etc. One report is fine if it covers multiple tests but if there are other formats used, then we want to see those too.</p>
<p>4. Is the Analytical Testing Lab Services solicitation for a new requirement? If not, may we please have the incumbent BPA number?<br />a. Solicitation FA8601-12-A-0018 is a new requirement.</p>
<p>5. Will you consider an 8(a) sole source for one of the BPA contracts you have for this contract. In other words, can you re-assign a separate sub-contract as an 8(a) sole source and also then compete the remaining contracts as full and open?<br />a. The BPA(s) will be awarded using full and open competition. If a 8(a) company submits a technically acceptable offer, they will be considered for a BPA.</p>
<p>6. Is there any possibility for a extension of the proposal dues date due to the complexity of the RFP response?<br />a. With the additional information added to this Solicitation. The Air Force will extend the proposal due date until 12 January 2012 @ 0900 EST.</p>
<p>7. At a glance, there is no indication that a GSA is necessary or required. Do you know if one is required for the work posted?<br />a. For this requirement, it is full and open competition; there is no GSA requirement to compete. Your price list should offer the best prices available and discounts are encouraged.</p>
<p>8. We have a new tax ID number and believe that our DUNS number will be in place by the end of the current year. However, CCR and ORCA will take approximately 7 to 14 days after the DUNS number is obtained. With the response due January 4th, do you think it would be a problem to submit a response without CCR and ORCA noting that it is in process?<br />a. The information you submit should be current. If you are registered in CCR and ORCA currently, you should use the current information. If it changes occur, you need to update CCR and ORCA as soon as the changes occur. The response time has changed to 12 Jan 12.</p>
<p>9. If we are a prime contractor and have established subcontractors who do other tests we currently don't, can we still bid on those tests that our subcontractors complete?<br />a. Yes, as long as you can meet the criteria in the Performance Work Statement and can establish a Firm Fixed Price, you can bid on whatever areas of interest you would like.</p>
<p>10. As stated in Paragraph 2.4 of the PWS the contractor is responsible for all shipping charges. Are there an average number of samples that a shipment might contain? <br />a. Yes, the contractor is responsible for all shipping charges in The US, which includes the sample kits shipped to the base and the return shipping. Sample kits are also included in the analytical cost. However, the USAF does pay for international shipping when that arises. The number is probably hard to quantify, a better estimate is probably weight. I would estimate 85% of our packages weight less than 2 lbs and would fit in a small fedex box.</p>
<p>Please email or call the point of contact listed in this solicitation if there are any further questions or concerns.</p>

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-54, effective December 2, 2011.
This solicitation is for full and open competition.  This is NOT set-aside.  The Government anticipates that the majority of this effort may be performed under NAICS code 621511, Medical Laboratories.  The size standard for this code is $13,500,000.00.  However, in order to provide a total solution to complete all the requirements, other appropriate NAICS codes may apply.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENTS:  The solicitation is issued by the Department of the Interior (DOI), National Business Center (NBC) to accomplish DOI=BFs Drug Free Workplace Program objectives.  On April 27, 1988, DOI established their Drug-Free Workplace Program which created a need for drug testing services; including the analysis of urine specimens to detect the presence of illegal drugs.  After the inception of the program, DOI allowed other federal agencies, organizations, commissions, and/or foundations to utilize its laboratory analysis contract to accomplish their own Drug Free Workplace Program objectives. Approximately 60 federal entities herein referred to as participating Agencies or Government, will be obtaining laboratory analysis services from this award.
The Contractor shall provide to the Government all labor, materials, and equipment necessary for the laboratory analysis of urine specimens.  The Contractor shall perform testing of urine specimens for the presence of Amphetamines, Opiates, Phencyclidine (PCP), Cocaine, and Marijuana (5 drug panel). DOI and most Agencies test for all five drug classes authorized by the regulatory bodies; however, this is not a mandatory requirement. Agencies may request a 2 panel (Marijuana, Cocaine) at no additional cost.  The Contractor shall be able to perform analysis on alternative specimens (other than urine); namely, hair, oral fluid, and sweat. This requirement is intended to cover any future alternative specimens which may be approved by the regulatory bodies and/or requested by the Agencies.  The Contractor shall be able to perform analysis on any drug listed in Schedule I or II of the DEA Controlled Substances Act.
The Contractor shall be required to perform and comply with all applicable provisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), "Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs", effective October 1, 2010 ; and the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (OTETA), in accordance with Department of Transportation (DOT) procedures including: 49 CFR Parts 40, 199, 219, 382, 391, 392, and 395; and 14 CFR Parts 61, 63, 65, 121, and 135, as applicable, which govern various transportation industries and the testing processes.
CONTRACT TYPE:  The requirement will be awarded as a Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract and an initial Task Order, each with a firm-fixed unit price for each line item.
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The period of performance of this task order is a total of five years if all options are exercised.  
BASE:  1 March 2012  - 30 September 2012OPTION I:    1 October 2012 =BF 30 September 2013OPTION II:   1 October 2013 =BF 30 September 2014OPTION III:  1 October 2014 =BF 30 September 2015OPTION IV: 1 October 2015 =BF 30 September 2016OPTION V: 1 October 2016 =BF 20 February 2017

<p>The following clauses are provided in full text:</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.271-88 GUARANTEES (APR 2010) <br />(a) In the event any work performed or materials furnished by the contractor under this contract prove defective or deficient within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel, the contractor, as directed by the Contracting Officer and at its own expense, shall correct and repair the deficiency to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer.<br />(b) The Government shall be entitled to rely upon any guarantee secured by the contractor or any sub-contractor covering work done or materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day period until its expiration. <br />(c) With respect to any individual work item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of such item. <br />(d) If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs.<br />(1) If the Contracting Officer determines it is impracticable or is otherwise not advisable to return the vessel to the contractor, or the contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may direct that the repairs be performed elsewhere, at the contractor's expense.<br />(2) Where corrections and repairs are to be made by other than the contractor due to nonreturn of the vessel to the contractor, the contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable deduction in the price of the contract.<br />(e) The contractor's liability shall only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects or deficiencies which it corrected. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility or relieve the liability of the contractor under the Liability and Insurance clause.<br />(f) At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, the contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable deduction in the contract price. Failure to agree upon an equitable reduction shall constitute a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(g) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract. If a defect or deficiency that exists at the time of redelivery of the vessel was not discovered by a reasonable inspection and is discovered after the expiration of the time frame stated in this clause, it is not subject to the time limitations stated in this clause.<br />(End of clause)<br />1352.271-90 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS (APR 2010)<br />(a) The contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the following insurance:<br />(1) Ship contractor's legal liability insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (b) of clause 1352.271-79.

2.	UV grating (3,600 rule) for BTX.
3.	USB bootstick.
4.	WE020 IoMan unit with modules for logging for logging meteorological sensors.  Note:  one sensor will be Gill ?Wind Master? 3-axis sonic anemometer.

<p>(3) The provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (May 2011) and Alternate 1 (Apr 2011) applies.</p>
<p>(4) The provision at FAR 52.212-4 CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jun 2010) and below addendum applies.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the<br />designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>
<p>(c) If no federal, state or local permits or compliance plans are required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite workplaces, then Contractor shall submit to the designated Port Engineer a letter, notarized under oath, that such documents are not required.<br />(d) Contractors will submit the following to the designated Port<br />Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: Data Sheets (MSDS) documents, certificates, specifications or any other manufacturing data verifying the VOC ratings of paints to be applied to the Cutter in accordance with MLCA Standard Spec 63000N, Section 5.3.1.</p>

Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence.<br />3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.<br />4.

<p>Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC. <br />DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT:<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>
<p>Work Request Process will occur in the following order:<br />1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COTR<br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COTR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Work Request- WR and IGE are generated by the COTR and forwarded to KO<br />4. COTR provides copy of Work Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on WR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COTR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY</p>
<p>No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACT DEFICIENCY REPORT</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report (CDR), SFLC Form 005. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved by the Contracting Officer, to the COTR. The COTR will comment on the Contractor's response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Contractor and Availability Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will render a final determination and provide it to the Contractor and COTR in writing.</p>

<DESC><p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA)<br />BAA-01-10-VACA<br />Research and Development for Technical Collection of Intelligence</p>
<p>FULL TEXT ANNOUNCEMENT - update effective 12/22/11</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Applied Research and Development for Technical Intelligence Collection of Intelligence Open 5 Year Broad Agency Announcement.</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-01-10-VACA</p>
<p>This BAA is open to all interested parties, including FFRDC, Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories. This BAA is set up in two parts: 1/ BASIC BAA and 2/ CALL BAA. The two parts are explained in separate sections below.</p>
<p>Anticipated funding under this BAA (not per contract) is $5 million per Fiscal Year (FY) from FY 12 through FY 14. Individual awards will normally not exceed 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $0.1 to $2 million per year.</p>
<p>This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding.</p>
<p>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: On behalf of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Virginia Contracting Activity (VACA) is soliciting innovative approaches and concepts to obtain unique and creative solutions, technologies, and state of the art approaches for technical collection of intelligence to include but not limited to Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT).</p>
<p>DIA is seeking demonstrations of first or next generation prototypes that can generally be developed within 12-24 months. New systems and approaches as well as novel exploitation of existing intelligence or non-intelligence systems and data with potential to satisfy gaps in intelligence collection capabilities are of interest. MASINT is technically derived intelligence that detects, locates and identifies unique and operationally exploitable signatures of fixed and dynamic sources of interest.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to rapidly develop and field capabilities for technical collection of intelligence consistent with current priorities. DIA is tasked to research, develop, and deploy new capabilities for technical collection of intelligence to provide persistent, undetected and difficult-to-counter surveillance of intelligence targets. Collected intelligence satisfies tactical and strategic needs of the war-fighter and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>This BAA will be reviewed annually. Any updates or possible cancellation will be issued as an amendment to the BAA. This annual review and subsequent amendments to the BAA shall meet the requirement of FAR 35.016 to update the BAA notice no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p>OTHER THAN WHITE PAPERS, NO PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAINST THIS BASELINE BAA. A letter requesting a proposal (RFP) will be issued by the Contracting Officer (CO) for each call and when needed after a technical review of a white paper. Due dates and times will be specified in each letter requesting a proposal issued by the CO in accordance with the instructions for proposals in response to white papers and calls starting on page 12 of this document. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended or CALLs are issued.</p>
<p>1/ BASIC BAA SECTION</p>
<p>White papers in response to the BASIC BAA will be accepted at any time. This BAA will remain open for White Paper submission through 1600 hours local time on the closing date, 30 November 2014. White papers received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPERS: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit two (2) copies of a four (4) to six (6) page white paper (not including cover sheet) summarizing their proposed approach solution for the relevant mission areas(s). The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper does not include a cost proposal. The white paper must include a short technical description of the concepts and planned approach to accomplish an operational demonstration of the technical objectives. It briefly describes the technologies to be pursued in the effort. White papers shall be sufficiently detailed to allow DIA to evaluate the concept's technical merit and its potential contributions to the DIA mission.</p>
<p>A Cover Sheet (Attachment 1) should be attached to the white paper. The Cover Sheet includes the anticipated period of performance as well as a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost. The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any. It is a best estimate of the anticipated cost of the effort. The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. White papers should avoid proprietary or data not critical to the idea being presented. Note: White papers already submitted under previous obsolete BAA-04-01-JT1 or BAA-05-01-JT2 should not be resubmitted under this BAA.</p>
<p>AREAS OF INTEREST: In order for perspective offerors to gain a clearer picture of DIA's current mission requirements and priorities it will be necessary to request mailing of classified information. Participants can request a registered mailing at the SECRET level from Mr. Miguel Guerra by providing their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number and a security point of contact. His unclassified email address is miguel.guerra@patrick.af.mil. Requestors must have a SECRET facility clearance and SECRET safeguarding that can be verified through the Industrial Security Facilities Database (ISFD).</p>
<p>FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: White papers that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. The white paper must be formatted as follows: Section A: Date, Title, Company name, Period of performance, estimated cost of task (see attachment 1); Section B: Task objective, relevant mission areas(s) being addressed and relevant past performance information; and Section C: Technical summary of objectives and the operational demonstration. Multiple white papers, within the purview of this announcement, may be submitted by offerors. All white papers shall be single spaced with a font no smaller than 12-pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address (both unclassified and classified if available) with their submission. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for contract award.</p>
<p>White paper submissions may now be submitted via email at AEcontracting@patrick.af.mil starting in mid January 2012.</p>
<p>White papers classified SECRET COLLATERAL and below shall be addressed to the Contract Specialist listed in the Current Point of Contacts Section below.</p>
<p>To submit white papers classified above SECRET COLLATERAL, contact the Security Officer Mr. Darrell Archard listed in the Current Point of Contacts Section below.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The white paper will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in "DESCENDING" order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits;</p>
<p>&bull; Importance/potential to DIA's mission areas;</p>
<p>&bull; Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p><br />Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other white papers submitted under this BAA. White papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received and government responses may take between 1-3 months.</p>
<p>PROPOSALS: White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. If requested to submit a formal proposal the offeror will be requested to do so in accordance with proposal instructions contained herein.</p>
<p>AWARD INFORMATION: Awards under this BAA will be made to offerors on the basis of the evaluation criteria above and program priorities. Awards will be subject to the availability of funds. Awards as a result of this BAA will be in the form of negotiated contracts. Options are discouraged and un-priced options will not be considered for award.</p>

<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION: Periodically over the 5-year period, proposal call announcements (CALLS) may be issued in the FedBizOps under BAA-01-10-VACA to request proposals for specific topic areas. These subsequent CALLS will contain specific objectives and descriptions of the specific topic area to be addressed, anticipated period of performance, information peculiar to the specific topic area, and the expected dollar range for proposals received under the CALL. Proposals in response to the CALL BAA (as explained below) will be accepted as specified in the actual CALL.</p>
<p>SCHEDULE: Proposal due dates and times will be specified in each CALL. Proposals received after the due date and time specified in the CALL shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement. Offerors MUST monitor FedBizOps https://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended or CALLs are issued. Offerors must monitor these systems to ensure they receive the maximum proposal preparation time for subsequent amendments as this is the official notification vehicle to request proposals.</p>
<p>COMMUNICATIONS: Prospective offerors may contact the technical point of contact (listed below) to verify interest in the effort to be proposed PRIOR to committing any resources to the preparation of any white papers in response to the BASIC BAA or proposals in response to a CALL under this announcement. Discussions shall not include content or rating information of other offeror's proposals or White Papers. Discussions with any of the points of contact shall not constitute a commitment by the Government to subsequently fund or award any proposed effort. Questions outside the scope of the technical focal point, such as contract terms and conditions, or projected award schedule, should be referred to the CO. Only COs are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are requested to advise the CO if they intend to submit a proposal in response to a CALL. Such notification is merely a courtesy and is not a commitment by the offeror to submit a proposal.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED PROGRAM COST: Each CALL will contain funding profiles specific to that effort. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>
<p>AWARD INFORMATION: Proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award made without discussions, unless discussions are determined to be necessary. However, the Government may obtain clarifications to determine proposal acceptability. Discussions may be held with prospective awardees prior to award if needed. In the event the Government is unable to conclude negotiations with the apparent successful offeror(s), it reserves the right to conduct negotiations with another acceptable offeror. Offerors are cautioned that only CO's are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.</p>

This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to CALLS or approved whitepapers issued pursuant to this BAA that are selected for award are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition In Contracting Act of 1984.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: Organizational Conflict of Interest may apply to this action but cannot be determined prior to issuance of this announcement or subsequent CALLS. This issue and the need for applicable clauses will be resolved prior to the award of any instrument resulting from an offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>TYPES OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS: The Government reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of research proposed. Accordingly, the Government may award any appropriate contract type under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. It is anticipated that awards under this BAA will generally be cost plus fixed fee, completion form contracts, which require successful offerors to have an accounting system considered adequate for tracking costs applicable to the contract. The anticipated type of contract will be stated in each CALL. Prospective offerors are encouraged to discuss the type of instrument proposed with the appropriate contracting point of contact prior to preparing a proposal. Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) with Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Completion) Task Orders are also anticipated. In the event an ID/IQ type of contract is anticipated, potential offerors are advised that during the course of the contract, the maximum dollar amount of the contract is subject to adjustments that may be appropriate for the Government to take full advantage of the contract ordering period.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS: The Government anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract per request for proposal; however, the Government reserves the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to a CALL or whitepaper.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL COSTS: The cost of preparing Government requested proposals, in response to this announcement, is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.</p>
<p>ELECTRONIC INVOICING REQUIREMENT: Any contract award resulting from this announcement will contain the clause at DFARS 252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests, which requires electronic submission of all payment requests. Any contract resulting from this announcement will establish a requirement to submit invoices through the electronic invoicing internet website using procedures described at http://www.nsa.gov/business/programs/electronic_invoicing.shtml . Access to the electronic invoicing website requires an External Certificate Authority (ECA/IECA) PKI certificate. Information on purchasing an ECA/IECA certificate is available on the internet at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>
<p>SUBCONTRACTING PLANS: Small Business Subcontracting Plans are required under FAR 19.702 for efforts anticipated to exceed $650,000. Prospective offerors shall submit applicable subcontracting plans in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.704 along with the technical and cost proposals. Small business is exempt from this requirement. If a company has a master subcontracting plan, as described in FAR 19.701 or a comprehensive subcontracting plan, as described in DFARS 219.702, a copy of the plan shall be submitted with the proposal. The subcontracting plan is a part of the cost/business section of the proposal and will not be included in the page count.</p>
<p>ITEM IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at DFARS 252.211-7003, Item Identification and Valuation, (Jan 2011) which requires unique item identification and valuation of any deliverable item for which the government's unit acquisition cost is $5,000 or more; subassemblies, components, and parts embedded within an item valued at $5,000 or more; or items for which the government's unit acquisition cost is less than $5,000 when determined necessary by the requiring activity for serially managed, mission essential, or controlled inventory. Also included are any DoD serially managed subassembly, component, or part embedded within a delivered item and the parent item that contains the embedded subassembly, component, or part. Per DFARS 211.274-3 policy for valuation, it is DoD policy that contractors shall be required to identify the government's unit acquisition cost for all items delivered, even if none of the criteria for placing a unique item identification mark applies. Therefore, your proposal must clearly break out the unit acquisition cost for any deliverable items. If you have questions regarding the unique item identification requirements, please contact the contracting point of contact listed above. For more information, see the following website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/uid/index.html</p>
<p>FORWARD PRICING RATE AGREEMENTS: Offerors who have forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA's) and forward pricing rate recommendations (FPRR's) should submit them with their proposal.</p>
<p>EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO) REGULATIONS: Pursuant to FAR 22.805, a pre-award clearance must be obtained from the U.S. Department Of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Office Of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) prior to award of a contract (or subcontract) of $10,000,000 or more unless the contractor is listed in OFCCP's National Pre-award Registry http://www.dol-esa.gov/preaward . This registry indicates that the contractor has been found to be "in compliance" within the past two years with The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) regulations that the OFCCP is mandated to enforce. The registry is updated nightly and facilities reviewed more than 2 years ago are removed and new ones are added. Award may be delayed if you are not currently listed in the registry and the contracting officer must request a pre-award clearance from the OFCCP.</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS ON PASS-THROUGH CHARGES-IDENTIFICATION OF SUBCONTRACT EFFORT: Any contract award resulting from this announcement may contain the clause at FAR 52.215-22, Limits on Pass Through Charges, (Oct 2009).</p>
<p>NON-GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL: All proprietary material should be clearly marked and will be held in strict confidence. The program office has contracted for various non-government scientific, engineering, technical and administrative staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. All non-government contractor support personnel have signed and are bound by the appropriate non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. Non-government staff support personnel will not have access to proposals that are labeled by the offerors as Government Access Only. Proposals labeled by the offerors as for "Administrative Purposes Only" will only be handled by non-government staff support contractors in an administrative role. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in this contract or order, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.</p>
<p>Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the CO and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. All evaluations and selections under this BAA will be made only by Government evaluators. Non-government staff support contractors may serve as technical advisors in the evaluation of proposals. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>DATA DELIVERABLES: The following data deliverables are representative of the types of data that may be required: (a) Program Plan with updates as needed; (b) Monthly Status/Financial Reports; (c) Final Report, draft and final; (d) Presentation Materials, (e) Patent Reports; and (f) Unique Identification Designator (UID) Report. Data deliverables are subject to negotiations on each individual award. Other deliverables that could be required include but are not limited to: (a) Hardware or Software Prototypes (to demonstrate and/or implement a concept); (b) Demonstration of Prototype or Advanced Technology.</p>
<p>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS (FFRDCS): FFRDCs may submit proposals in response to this announcement. FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs shall provide rationale in its proposal that the research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. The Government does not intend that FFRDCs use privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector. If a contractor proposes using a FFRDC as a subcontractor, other than DOD-sponsored FFRDCs in the capacities discussed in DFARS 235.017, it must provide rationale in its proposal that supports the unique capability of the FFRDC. Also, the contractor's proposal must demonstrate that the FFRDC can accept work from other than the sponsor.</p>
<p>U.S. EXPORT CONTROL LAWS: Data subject to U.S. Export Control Laws may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data. Therefore, only offerors who are certified by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) may submit proposals.

<p>B. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL:</p>
<p>a. Content: The technical proposal must convey an understanding of the problems or limitations of the general technology area and the intended application(s). The technical proposal shall include the following items.</p>
<p>1. Executive Summary: Describe the proposed program, objectives, and approach. A description of the innovation and benefits of the proposed approach and relationship to previous efforts should be discussed. It should summarize the technical issues addressed by the offeror's proposal without repeating the requirements. This should provide a vision of what will ultimately be achieved and what solution this effort will produce.</p>
<p>2. Program Description: Describe the techniques, methods, materials, or ideas that will be addressed in this proposal, their innovation, and to what degree they advance the state-of-the-art.</p>
<p>3. Program Plan: Describe in detail the planned approach and how the plan will be executed. This section should include all technical aspects of the approach. Provide technical detail and analysis necessary to support the technical approach proposed. Clearly identify the core of the intended approach. The plan should cite the qualitative and quantitative success criteria that the proposed effort should achieve. The "new and creative" solution to the problem(s) should be developed and analyzed in this section. Include a risk assessment of key technical, schedule or cost areas and their potential impact on the program. Identify why proposed subcontractors were selected and what tasks they are to perform, if applicable.</p>
<p>4. Contractor's Statement of Work (C-SOW): The C-SOW shall follow the format of appendix B. The C-SOW, a stand-alone document, should detail the research to be accomplished under the technical area and should be suitable for incorporation into the awarded document. The proposed C-SOW should summarize the technical methodology and the task description, but not to the extent to make the awarded instrument inflexible. Contractors may request copies of our contracts under the Freedom of Information Act. Consequently, it is imperative that no company-sensitive information be included in the C-SOW. The C-SOW should include the anticipated deliverables (hardware, software, reports, etc.). Do not include any proprietary information in the C-SOW.</p>
<p>5.

<p><br />PROPOSAL REVIEW AND EVALUATION PROCEDURES</p>
<p>GENERAL: The Government reserves the right to select for award to responsible offerors/contractors any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement, subject to the availability of funds. The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time. You may be ineligible for award if all requirements of this announcement and subsequent CALLS are not met by the proposal due date and time. At minimum, incomplete proposals may be given lower priority and, although technically acceptable, not awarded due to funding limitations. No further evaluation criteria will be used.</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The selection of one or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each offeror's proposal to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 35.016. The proposals will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process, in conjunction with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government, which are listed in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal;</p>
<p>&bull; Importance to DIA's mission areas;</p>
<p>&bull; Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p>Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under this BAA. Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. All responsible organizations may submit a proposal that shall be considered.</p>
<p>REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated at the same time and categorized as follows:</p>
<p>CATEGORY I: Well conceived scientifically and technically sound proposals important to program goals and objectives. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance subject to funding constraints.</p>
<p>CATEGORY II: Scientifically or technically sound proposals that may require further development and may be recommended for acceptance, but are at a lower priority than Category I proposals and are not always funded.</p>
<p>CATEGORY III: Proposals not technically sound or do not meet agency needs and may be recommended for rejection.</p>
<p>AWARD NOTICES: An award notice will be posted to Federal Business Opportunities website under this BAA for each call in a reasonable amount of time after award. Offerors will be notified in writing whether or not their proposal is recommended for award. An award recommendation is not to be construed to mean the award of a contract or assistance instrument is assured as availability of funds and successful negotiations are prerequisites to any award. Offerors are cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to obligate funds and commit the Government.</p>
<p>DEBRIEFINGS: When requested, a debriefing will be provided. The debriefing process will follow the time guidelines set out in 10 USC 2305(b)(5), but the debriefing content will vary to be consistent with the procedures set out in FAR 35.016 governing BAAs.</p>

<p>14. Interdivisional transfers (detailed breakout of costs)</p>
<p>a. Subcontractors: Subcontractors' proposals must be similarly structured. All subcontracted work must be properly identified as such. If a subcontractor elects to submit an abbreviated proposal, it is the offeror's responsibility to see that the subcontractor submits the information requested in paragraph 1 - 14 above as appropriate and submits the proposal directly to the Government's point of contact. The offeror must ensure that the subcontractor adheres to the guidance set forth herein. FAR 15.404-3 requires that the offeror provide an analysis of subcontractors' cost proposals. To that end, offeror's proposal must:</p>
<p>(1) Identify principal items/services to be subcontracted.</p>
<p>(2) Identify prospective subcontractors and the basis on which they were selected. If non-competitive, provide selected source justification</p>
<p>(3) Identify the type of contractual business arrangement contemplated for the subcontract and provide a rationale for same.</p>
<p>(4) Identify the basis for the subcontract costs (e.g., firm quote or engineering estimate, etc).</p>
<p>(5) Identify the cost or pricing data or information other than cost or pricing data submitted by the subcontractor.</p>
<p>(6) Provide an analysis of the proposed subcontract in accordance with FAR 15.404-3(b). Provide an analysis concerning the reasonableness, realism and completeness of each subcontractor's proposal. If the analysis is based on comparison with prior prices, identify the basis on which the prior prices were determined to be reasonable. The analysis should include, but not be limited to, an analysis of: materials, labor, travel, other direct costs and proposed profit or fee rates.</p>
<p>b. Changes to Pricing Proposals: Changes to previously submitted proposals must include documentation indicating how a previously submitted proposal is impacted or affected.</p>
<p>(1) If changes to the original proposal are relatively insignificant and involve only minor changes to elements such as labor rates, overhead and General and Administrative (G&amp;A) rates, bill of material changes, travel costs, and Other Direct Costs (ODC's), these change can be accomplished through the use of change pages or slip pages accompanied by new cost summaries.</p>

<p>CFDA Number: 12.800 <br /><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Integrated Cyber Defense attributes.</p>
<p>This BAA seeks to procure proactive cyberspace defensive capabilities for anticipating and avoiding threats through understanding the cyber situation, predicting adversarial actions, assessing potential impacts, and for implementing deterrence and effects-based defensive methodologies. It also supports work to detect and defeat threats and protect information systems by engagement and influence through defensive mechanisms employing such methods as adversary denial and deception. Also included are areas to adaptively maintain, organize, and automatically regenerate and reconstitute resources to ensure continued mission operations.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Information Directorate is soliciting white papers for Cyber Mission focus areas and Computer Network Defense &amp; Support. The following section provides a description of focus areas within Integrated Cyber Defense and a general description of the Computer Network Defense (CND) &amp; Support Technology base.</p>
<p>NOTE: The POC for each focus area is provided for QUESTIONS ONLY. See Section IV Paragraph 6 for submission details.</p>
<p>FY 11 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: CYBER AGILITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Currently, adversaries can plan their attacks carefully over time by relying on the static nature of our networks, and launch their attacks at the times and places of their choosing. The DoD needs new tools and technologies to reverse the current asymmetry that favors our cyber adversaries, by forcing them to spend more, cope with greater levels of complexity and uncertainty, and accept greater risks of exposure and detection due to the significantly increased requirements for reconnaissance and intelligence collection of our networks. If we control the dynamics of our systems and networks, any deviation from these known dynamics can also provide an opportunity for increased discrimination of attacker activity and unexpected system states. AFRL will pursue Science &amp; Technology for defensive cyber maneuver and agility to disrupt adversary cyberspace operations, including adversary attack planning and execution.</p>
<p>Agility mechanisms must be incorporated in such a way that they are transparent to authorized users, and must introduce minimal functional and performance impacts. We wish to disrupt our adversaries and not ourselves. The security of such mechanisms is also paramount, so that their power is not co-opted by attackers against us for their own purposes.</p>
<p>Objective: The objective is to avoid attacks by making it harder for a determined adversary to succeed by increasing agility, diversity, and redundancy, to disrupt attack planning and execution.</p>

<p>For FY12, we are specifically seeking white papers in the two areas of "Polymorphic Enclaves" and "Polymorphic Machines" as described below.</p>
<p>FY 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: POLYMORPHIC ENCLAVES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The current static nature of our systems and networks allows attackers to continually gather intelligence, and perform planning needed, to execute cyber attacks at will. Intelligence collection can occur from both outside and inside our networks; therefore agility must be incorporated comprehensively across our networks to address these threats. Network intelligence gathered by an attacker remains valid for as long as the network remains static. In order to help defend and shield our networks from attack, we must break the underlying assumption of their static nature.<br /><br />Objective: We seek to create a rapidly-shifting network architecture with automated agility and diversity mechanisms, to continually, dynamically, and unpredictably modify or morph the network into secure operational modes both before and during attacks. If a successful attack should occur, the network must not only survive the attack, but also ensure minimal disruption of the services provided by the network by "mutating" or shifting into a form that can prevent further or future attacks. These capabilities must, however, maintain the transparency and utility of the network and its services to authorized users, while creating uncertainty and complexity for the attacker. Potential agility techniques may include asymmetric routing; MAC, IP, and Port hopping; service migration; OS "fingerprint" spoofing; and possibly protocol mutations. These techniques must be employed in combination with a system-level architecture that ties these mechanisms together, to ensure optimal effectiveness and proper management.</p>

<p>FY 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: POLYMORPHIC MACHINES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Large-scale adoption of homogeneous computing environments, such as the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), creates significant risk of wide-spread and rapidly-executed disabling attacks. Standardized machine configurations like the FDCC are widely adopted in government and industry. They have been shown to reduce maintenance costs and some vulnerabilities by simplifying and standardizing configuration, and thus reducing the incidence of attacks due to human errors. Unfortunately, a single attack exploit for the standardized configuration can be used to compromise all systems with that configuration. To counter this threat, we can leverage for example, virtualization extensions found in modern commodity processors to provide low overhead diversification of code. We can also apply metamorphic transformations on code, a technique that has been effectively used by malware authors, to create semantically equivalent but behaviorally different variants of programs.</p>
<p>Objective: We seek a variety of different methods and mechanisms, integrated and applied in a manner that is controlled by the transformation and diversification process, and yet appears to an attacker to be a continuously and randomly shifting target space. These capabilities must, however, maintain the transparency and utility of the systems to authorized users, while creating uncertainty and complexity for the attacker.</p>

<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: INCORRUPTIBLE DATA CODES / EXECUTABLES</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) requires trustworthy data and software executables for successful performance of assigned missions.</p>
<p>Objective: Deliver self-contained, verifiably incorruptible/trustworthy data and executables with protection while at rest, under execution, or in transit upon and within any environment/system relevant to the warfighter. This includes both our own systems and systems that we do not own or directly control.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Incorruptible Data Codes / Executables" focus area is interested in the research challenges identified below. However, different approaches and concepts deemed to have significant potential to achieve the stated objectives will be considered.<br /><br />&bull; Development and technical evaluation and refinement of watermarking algorithms and protocols for the purpose of information provenance, pedigree, and assurance:<br /><br />&bull; Addressing all forms of data and multimedia formats; to include but not limited to: images, audio, video, formatted and raw data types<br /><br />&bull; Protocols with provable security which incorporate other accepted security mechanisms (timestamping, hashing, key exchange, etc.)<br /><br />&bull; Particular emphasis on:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Interaction of watermarked data with watermarked/secured code which has Anti-Tamper and Protection guarantees<br /><br />&bull; Watermarking algorithms and protocols which provide multiple aspects (provenance, pedigree, assurance) while working in conjunction with data for specific application (sensing, etc)<br /><br />&bull; Software-only data and executable protections <br /><br />&bull; Hardware-assisted data and executable protections<br /><br />&bull; Measuring and verifying incorruptibility/trust</p>

<p>FY11 &amp; FY12 FOCUS AREA: ASSURED EXECUTION</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The current focus of computer security is at the operating system (e.g. role-based users), applications (e.g. anti-virus programs), and the network (e.g. firewalls). Focus needs to be shifted to the operating system at the hardware and virtualized hardware layers. Innovative technology developments are sought to defend computers and computer networks, and assure dynamic mission objectives.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision of this program is "A trusted execution environment within each device (e.g. computer, network router) that is a platform for conducting cyber defensive operations that uses "out of band" communication, and remains trusted should the host be compromised." The two areas of high interest are 1) Virtualization and 2) Root of Trust.</p>
<p>Virtualization: The combination of complex applications running on complex operating systems presents a very large footprint to attack. Additionally, DoD has very little control over modern shrink-wrapped software applications and operating systems. Current cost concerns prohibit DoD from developing, building, and maintaining their own applications, operating systems, and hardware. Virtualization technologies offer ways to defeat cyber attacks prior to engagement. Key concepts include but are not limited to: A secure environment that encapsulates and protects the operating systems, device drivers, and applications; secure, segregated, inaccessible areas for critical code; and secure communications for critical code processes.</p>
<p>Root of Trust: The integrity of computers and computer networks is dependent on the integrity of the host hardware and host root account. This area of research investigates modeled hardware root of trust that imparts immunity from an adversary with root access to the underlying host. Innovative ways to achieve a secure root of trust on a host are sought. Also sought are ways to achieve a network root of trust.</p>

<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: FIGHT THROUGH &amp; SURVIVE WITH MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The DoD has a critical need for information systems that adapt and/or gracefully degrade when unexpected events occur. These systems are subjected to constant change such as overload, component failure, cyber attacks, evolving operational requirements, and/or a dynamic operational environment. A system should adapt to these changes by reconfiguring its resources to provide a different, though acceptable, level of service and security to assure mission essential functions. Without adaptation many important activities receive fewer resources than needed while less important activities waste resources by receiving more resources than necessary. Most existing systems either do not adapt or have ad hoc hardwired mechanisms to accommodate only a small, predefined, set of changes. There are no standard methodologies or common tools to assist application developers in managing this sort of dynamic adaptation.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "survive with mission assurance". This focus area is concerned with runtime assessment and management of resources/assets to ensure mission essential functions and conveying trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Fight Through &amp; Survive with Mission Assurance" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p>(1) Cyber Defense Metrics - Identify low-level observable properties and measurable quantities that contribute to the mission based assessment.</p>
<p>(2) Mission Aware Adaptive Tradeoffs - Integration of QoS (Functionality) and QoIA (Security) management. There is a need to understand tradeoff policy and de-confliction of QoS and QoIA based on the mission. There is a need to develop fine-grained tunable IA mechanisms and controls.</p>
<p>(3) Survivability Architecture- Compose a survivability architecture that supports and enforces service delivery and information assurance requirements based on mission priorities.<br />Funding for this focus area is not available in FY12.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to:<br />Pat Hurley (315) 330-3624 <a href="mailto:Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil">Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p>FY 11 &amp; 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: SELF-REGENERATIVE INCORRUPTIBLE ENTERPRISE THAT DYNAMICALLY RECOVERS WITH IMMUNITY</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Existing approaches to information system security and survivability consist of preventing, detecting and containing unintentional errors and/or cyber attacks. The problem with this approach is that regardless of how well systems are protected or how well they tolerate errors and/or attacks; they will eventually fail over time unless they have the ability to self-regenerate. Once a successful cyber attack is discovered the adversary can quickly use the same attack over and over again to cause the same negative effect on our mission. Existing systems are currently taken offline and out of the fight for hours to days to be repaired and there is no guarantee that the repair is immune to the attack or variants of the attack. What are needed are information systems that are able to dynamically recover with immunity in mission time without human intervention in response to unforeseen errors and/or previously unknown cyber attacks.</p>
<p>Objective: The vision for this focus area is "recover with immunity". This focus area is concerned with recovering with immunity from errors and/or cyber attacks to ensure mission critical systems stay in the fight.</p>
<p>Research Concentration Areas: The "Self Regenerative, Incorruptible Enterprise" focus area explores the research challenges below, but other approaches that achieve the stated objectives will be considered:</p>
<p><br />(1) Persistent applications (data &amp; state) - The goal of this technology area is to make applications hard to corrupt, disable or remove (like malware). When an attack is successful these applications find a way to keep performing the mission.</p>
<p>(2) Machine Generated Reconstitution - The goal of this technology area is to automatically machine-generate repairs to recover with immunity from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(3) Reconstitution of Data and State - The goal of this technology area is mission continuation by automatically repairing corrupted data &amp; state to remove residue from errors/cyber attacks.</p>
<p>(4) Understanding Synthetic Diversity or other technology used to recover with immunity - There is a need to better understand the use of synthetic diversity or other technology used to ensure complete attack space coverage and/or understand the effectiveness against various classes of cyber attack.</p>
<p>Funding for the Self-Regenerative Incorruptible Enterprise focus area in FY12 will focus on persistent applications (data &amp; state).</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: <br />Pat Hurley (315) 330-3624 <a href="mailto:Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil">Patrick.Hurley@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p>FY 11 &amp; FY12 FOCUS AREA: CYBER MISSION ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>This focus is on novel approaches to assure critical Air Force mission essential functions (MEF) in a contested cyber environment. Mission assurance seeks to codify a top-down approach for mapping MEF dependence on cyberspace across the information lifecycle (information generation, processing, storage, transmission, consumption and destruction), identifying cyber vulnerabilities, developing metrics to assess the risk from cyber vulnerabilities on MEF, and developing strategies to mitigate the vulnerabilities. We view mission assurance in the context of preventing and avoiding threats by deterring potential threats through increased costs and reduced benefits.</p>
<p>We seek a scientific basis for mission assurance, including the development of mathematical models to represent MEF dependence on cyber, an exploration of the fractal nature of mission mapping, and the development of metrics for the cost of vulnerability mitigation in proportion to the increased cost to potential threats. These will in turn enable the development of more rigorous approaches to situational understanding as well as command and control.<br /><br />Research into cloud computing technologies could provide potential solutions to the mission assurance research area by increasing the availability and redundancy of continuous or contingency operations. We invite novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture. We seek solutions that utilize the dynamic characteristics of cloud computing technology to prevent and avoid threats. Under the establishment of an internal center of excellence in cloud computing, there is a need for further research within AFRL and the DoD community. The center of excellence should provide opportunities for this research through collaboration and related internships.</p>
<p>Objectives:</p>
<p>&bull; Create a scientific basis for mission assurance.<br /><br />&bull; Provide novel techniques for secure data storage, processing and communication practices within a cloud architecture.<br /><br />&bull; Construct appropriate research opportunities within the DoD community.<br /><br />&bull; Support other S&amp;T initiatives in the areas of situational understanding and command and control</p>
<p>Questions regarding this focus area can be directed to: Dr. Sarah Muccio (315) 330-4016 <a href="mailto:Sarah.Muccio@rl.af.mil">Sarah.Muccio@rl.af.mil</a> or Mr. Brian Kropa (315) 330-1544 <a href="mailto:Brian.Kropa@rl.af.mil">Brian.Kropa@rl.af.mil</a></p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is not limited to the aforementioned focus areas.</p>
<p>Other applicable areas of technology include, but are not limited to, Rapid/Live Forensics, Botnet Detection &amp; Mitigation, Attack Attribution, Insider Threat Detection &amp; Mitigation, Range Development, and Cyber Modeling, Simulation, Metrics, and Measurements. The work could include 'Abnormality ID and Remediation' and might also include 'Cyber Economic Incentives' which would entail a look at the concept of 'Amortization of R &amp; D' (that is, a look at quantification of how long to pay back R &amp; D resources used for an operational improvement before the R &amp; D/Ops improvement becomes obsolete). Also, Data Mining application under Visualization Support would be applicable.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>(1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, and understanding of the technical and operational approach for employment of the technology;</p>
<p>(2) The effort's potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force's mission assurance objectives;</p>
<p>(3) The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, which may include testing of prototype capabilities and assessment against Information Assurance requirements; and</p>
<p>(4) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs, and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGA will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.<br /><br />Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (<a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp">www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp</a>) are allowed access to such data.</p>

<p>The general session is expected to be held from 8:00 am until 10:00 am, and the small business session is expected to be held from 10:30 am until 11:30 am. One-on-one sessions will begin on the afternoon of 12 January and will each last 60 minutes. If necessary, one-on-one sessions will continue on 13 January.</p>

<p><br />Registration:<br />All parties intending to participate must complete the attached Registration Form and submit the Form to the Primary Point of Contact via email no later than 5:00 pm, 9 January 2012.</p>
<p>Access to Fort MacArthur is restricted. Attendees must be United States citizens or legal residents.

A company may send no more than 3 attendees to the general session (and small business session, if appropriate). Attendees are encouraged to arrive early to permit sufficient time for check-in.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for market research and acquisition strategy planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of MICC -YPG. The purpose of this notice is to solicit industry feedback relative to various aspects of the proposed contract effort and its associated documentation.  The services anticipated for this effort may include, but not be limited to the following functions:<br><br>Electronic Instrumentation Operation<br>Optical and Geodetic Instrumentation Operation<br>Metrology and Simulation Operation<br>Computation and Automation<br>Test Operation and Maintenance Support<br>Range Management Operations<br>Technical and Engineering Special Services<br>Range Communication Operations<br>Information Management Operations<br>Data Management and Test Coordination<br><br>A Draft Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) with Attachments 1-12 and a draft Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) are provided for reference and industry comment and are subject to change.<br><br>Information Sought:<br><br>(1)  Please provide feedback on areas within the QASP that, in your opinion, have an overall positive and/or negative impact on the process of evaluating contractor performance (i.e. performance objectives, evaluation process, surveillance procedures, performance rating definitions, etc).   Are there any areas which appear unduly burdensome to either the Government or the Contractor towards the goal of achieving superior Contractor performance or counter-productive to surveillance goals and objectives in general.  <br><br>(2)  Monthly performance assessments are compiled using several different methods of data capture.  One such area of assessment is a Customer Feedback/Satisfaction inspection which inputs to YTC's Contractor Rating Database (See Attachment 2).  This inspection consists of four elements with associated percentages (1) Efficiency 35%; (2) Technical Adequacy 45%; (3) Responsiveness 10%; and (4) Feedback/Liaison 10%.   Are these elements good indicators for achieving superior contractor performance, and if not, please provide feedback on alternative elements which could be targeted to continuously drive an optimum test support response?  <br><br>(3)  The performance objectives of the attached Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) are considered to be major elements for successful execution of the contract.  Based on corporate experience of similar contracts, for this type of mission (test) support services, are the objectives listed consistent with this type of service or are there additional objectives which could/should be assessed to ensure optimal performance of the contractor?<br><br>(4)   What type of contractor incentives would be appropriate for the Mission (Test) Support Services requirement, in a potential cost-plus incentive fee type contract environment?<br><br>(5)  Please provide feedback on what motivates a contractor's performance in a highly dynamic test arena and the potential risk, if any, of each motivator, and to whom? <br><br>(6)  Please provide suggested surveillance methods, incentives, and/or any other feedback you deem appropriate with regards to these topics.<br><br>The MICC - YPG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses, nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted, nor will respondents be notified of the MICC - YPG's review of the information received. The information obtained from the RFI will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the Acquisition Strategy/Plan for this requirement. Interested sources shall provide all feedback in writing no later than 5:00 PM MST, 12 January 2012.<br>

This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is not at this time seeking proposals. CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI. All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be posted in the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fbo.gov).

<p style="text-align: left; mso-layout-grid-align: none;"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK2"><span style="mso-bookmark: OLE_LINK3"><span style="COLOR: black">CBP is an agency of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whose mission is to prevent the illegal flow of people and goods across U.S. air, land, and sea borders while expediting the safe flow of lawful travel and commerce. As the nation's single, unified border agency, CBP's mission is vitally important for the protection of the American people and the national economy. CBP represents the first line of defense of America's borders. One of CBP's strategic objectives is to establish and maintain effective control of air, land, and maritime borders with the appropriate mix of infrastructure, technology, and personnel. An integral component to this situational awareness is the use of mobile video surveillance systems, which provide information on the location and movement of potential Items of Interest (IoIs).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black">CBP consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for mobile video surveillance systems. CBP plans to utilize mobile video surveillance technology to enhance agents' ability to detect and track illegal incursions and to provide CBP agents with improved situational awareness between the Ports of Entry (POE). This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market. CBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated mobile video surveillance system technology described in the following sections. CBP intends to deploy these surveillance systems as part of a tailored, layered approach to improve situational awareness along the U.S. Southwest Border. There is no intent to develop any items or systems under this program. </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist CBP in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement. However, responses to this RFI are solicited from all interested parties.</p>

<SOLNBR>DHAPPBAA11002
<NTYPE>PRESOL
<CONTACT>Latrice Rubenstein 619-532-4357
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to incorporate the following:

1.	Request concept papers for Belize, Caribbean Regional, and  Sudan as described below by 01 February 2012 for first round consideration:  
Belize:
HVOP $75,000 - 125,000
Between 2009-2010, a biological and behavioral surveillance survey (BBSS) of HIV infection in the Belize Defense Force (BDF) indicated that alcohol abuse and mental trauma were closely linked with sexual risk behaviors in the Defense Force population.  Culturally appropriate and military-relevant interventions to reduce sexual risk behavior among BDF personnel are needed.  This request is for proposals to develop a behavioral/mental health harm reduction intervention pilot aimed at decreasing sexual risk behavior and improving mental health outcomes among BDF personnel.
  The pilot should illustrate effects of the intervention (quantitative and qualitative) which may be used to inform the development of a larger intervention throughout the force.  


Caribbean Regional:
HVSI $300,000
Proposals are requested for Monitoring and Evaluation training that provides basic understanding of fundamental principles and applicability to HIV/AIDS programming. Proposed offeror should provide standard course for several countries at once and additionally TA in the development of M&E systems for existing programs on-site. Existing programs focus on prevention and counseling and testing services.   In addition, proposed offeror will evaluate prevention programs and uptake of CT sites for existing programs.
  


Sudan:
The proposal request for Sudan is separated into three categories: (1) Prevention, (2) Testing & Counseling, and (3) Care & Treatment. While offerors are welcome to submit proposals for any of the three areas or combination thereof, it is strongly recommended that submissions focus on one of the three categories and cover each of the program areas listed under that category. The introduction is relevant to each of the categories of proposals.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE / REQUEST FOR INFORMATION; not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations. Pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research), the purpose of this notice is to: (1) determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exists, (2) determine if commercial items suitable to meet the agency's needs are available or could be modified to meet the agency's requirements, and (3) determine the commercial practices of company's engaged in providing the needed service or supply. Pursuant to FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 19, competition and set-aside decisions may be based on the results of this market research. This notice in no way obligates the Government to any further action.
Requirement: This notice is issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Boston VA Healthcare System, West Roxbury, MA to identify sources capable of providing the following:
VISN 1 Contracting is conducting market research on long-term cardiac rhythm monitors and monitoring services.  We are requesting brand name or equal products that compare to the product information and salient characteristics for the ZIO Patch Mobile Cardiac Telemetry Devices and Arrhythmia monitoring service manufactured and monitored by IRhythm Technologies.   Please see the following product information and salient characteristics below.
Product Information/Salient Characteristics
The Zio Patch is a long-term cardiac rhythm monitor that provides continuous monitoring for up-to-14 days (significantly longer than the time period of a typical Holter). By providing a longer time period of continuous recording, the Zio Patch improves the likelihood of capturing arrhythmias and provides for an equal or higher diagnostic yield versus other devices on the market.  Diagnostic findings are not reported until the device is returned to Rhythm Technologies and will be posted to their website for review and printing for final interpretation by Cardiologist.  

The Zio Patch is indicated for use on patients who may be asymptomatic or who may suffer from transient symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, light-headedness, presyncope and syncope, shortness of breath, anxiety and fatigue. As with all iRhythm products, the Zio Patch is 100% recyclable. No part of the device will end up in a landfill, minimizing the impact of disposable devices on the environment.

Intended Use:  The ZIO Patch will be applied to upper left chest of patient and to be worn up to 14 days to monitor patient's rate and rhythm. It is a diagnostic tool to aid physicians in the treatment of their patients with arrhythmia problems or to rule out arrhythmia problems due to various symptoms.
Benefits:
"	Easy for patient to use:  Apply and remove device from chest after monitoring period.  The ZIO Patch has no electrodes, lead wires or telephone to wear as with "real time" event monitoring devices.  
"	Can be worn during showering (though not to be immersed in water completely as in swimming), thus eliminating breaks in monitoring period.

"	Depending upon indications for use, can save considerable costs with use of the device and less ordering of more expensive monitoring device for real time monitoring.

"	Offers longer periods of monitoring than standard 24 or 48 hour monitors to capture infrequent but questionable symptoms of palpitations, dizziness, etc.

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) 
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: 
Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, for Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC)

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 
This action requested to be reviewed and approved is to seek other than full and open competition for the annual preventive maintenance service for the Biomerieux Bact/Alert 3D automated microbial detection system that belongs to microbiology.  The purchase request is 648-11-4-5095-0867, posted under solicitation VA-260-11-RI-1333, and proposed purchase order is VA648-C11983.  The purchase order is valued at $4,908.00.  In accordance with FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full And Open Competition dated 3-22-2011.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:
The Biomerieux Bact/Alert 3D automated microbial detection system is an instrument that is used for sepsis risk stratification and monitoring for the presence or absence of microorganisms in blood, sterile body fluids, and mycobacteria. This instrument helps to identify a wide range of organisms in a very accurate and efficient manner improving patient care.   This one-time annual service is quoted at $5,000.
  
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:
The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). The specific reason for restricting competition is the contracting officer has determined that only one source is reasonably available due to the fact that the selected vendor has gained sole proprietary rights to perform the required service.  At this time, no other vendor has the capability of fulfilling the requirement.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):
Biomerieux is the only vendor authorized to service this instrument because the parts and tools required to complete the job are manufacturer specific.  Market research supports the fact that the vendor is the only qualified and available source to provide the distinct and thorough service necessary for this device.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:
The contract specialist posted a special notice on FBO to publicize the VA's intent to solicit from a single source.  The notice was available on December 8th.  

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:
In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2), the anticipated cost of $5,000.00 will be determined fair and reasonable based upon previous one-time maintenance and repairs of similar acquisitions.  .

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):
Based on FDA regulations, the manufacturer's equipment must be maintained to specifications only trained and certified individuals are authorized to perform.  Per conversation with the manufacturer, no third party contractors have been trained or certified to perform any services on this equipment.  No vendor expressed interest after the intent to go with a single source notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities website (FBO).  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:
No other facts beyond what has been described above are available to support restricting competition.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
No vendors expressed interest in writing at this time.

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:
The contract specialist will continue to seek competition to the fullest extent possible.

<p><strong>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL </strong></p>
<p>TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<em>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY</p>
</em>
<p>Justification for OTFAOC Number: JA12-003</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Procuring Activity Competition Advocate, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. &sect;2304c(b)(2)(i)(C). Per FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C), the order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract when all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order.</p>
<strong>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>1. REQUIRING AGENCY AND CONTRACTING OFFICE:</p>
</strong>
<p>Contracting Activity:</p>
<p>Defense Information Systems Agency</p>
<p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization, Code PL8313</p>
<p>2300 East Drive, Bldg. 3600, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5406</p>
<p>Requiring Activity:</p>
<p>Defense Information Systems Agency</p>
<p>Network Services Organizational Messaging &amp; National Gateway Technical Support Br</p>
<p>Building 1671</p>
<p>Fort Detrick, Maryland 21702-5002</p>
<strong>
<p>2. NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION(S):</p>
</strong>
<p>This justification is for the award of a sole source task order to provide Defense Message System (DMS) and National Gateway Center (NGC) Support System Software and Security Engineering Services. This task order is a logical follow-on task order to ENCORE II HC1028-08-D-2018 TO 0005. The acquisition will be a base plus one option year task order, funded with Defense Working Capital Funds (DWCF). Funding for the base year of the task order will be FY12 funding. This acquisition will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) task order. This task order will be awarded under the ENCORE II contract.</p>
<strong>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:</p>
</strong>
<p>This task order action provides software life cycle maintenance (LCM) for two DMS NGC support systems-the DMS Asset Distribution System <strong>(</strong>DADS) and the DMS Tool Suite (DTOOLS) to include DISA Message Trace (DMT), DISA Software Version Tool (DSVT), Message Event Tool (MET), and DISA Component Monitor Tool (DCMT), and Message Conversion System Management Workstation (MCS MWS) Tool. Software LCM includes software maintenance, database updates, testing, security compliance engineering, and operational support. Additionally, this task order provides network administration and security engineering for the Detrick Technology Development Facilities (TDF) network. The DADS, DTOOLS, and Detrick TDF network must be maintained at a level which supports the DISA 99.9% availability Page 2 of 7 Pages</p>
<p>management threshold, the DMS Multi-command Required Operational Capability (MROC) messaging capabilities in support of the Warfighter, and security requirements necessary to maintain operational accreditation.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be a base plus one option period task order with a total estimated cost of $3,047,736.</p>
<p>Base Task Order Year: $1,501,348</p>
<p>Option Year One: $1,546,388</p>
<p>The task order will be funded with Defense Working Capital Funds (DWCF). This acquisition will be a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) task order.</p>
<strong>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY: 10 U.S.C. &sect;2304c(b)(2)(i)(C)</p>
</strong>
<p>The order must be issued on a sole source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to a task order already issued under the contract. All twenty-six ENCORE II contractors were previously solicited for the initial award of this requirement. FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C).</p>
<strong>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:</p>
</strong>
<p>The contractor, HP Enterprise Services (HPES), is qualified to provide the required mission critical services to the DMS Global System Manager (GSM) based upon unique qualifications and successful past experience. HPES, previously known as Electronic Data Systems (EDS), completed the initial development and has provided all software maintenance for the DADS and DTOOLS products since their inception. No other contractor has ever provided software maintenance for these critical organizational messaging tools. Additionally, HPES personnel have designed, implemented, and maintained the TDF network backbone architecture and components for the last 15+ years. This network is complex, interconnecting with the NGC operational network. Knowledge of the system architecture and the security requirements necessary to maintain system accreditation is critical to the Detrick NGC Command and Control messaging mission immediately upon contract award. All task order requirements included in this acquisition have been provided under previous DEIS, DEIS II, ENCORE I, and ENCORE II task orders awarded to EDS/HPES.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C) exceptions to the fair opportunity process, this order will be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to a TO already issued under the ENCORE II contract. All prime ENCORE II contractors were solicited in RFP E200045.00-Competitive 02 September 2008. EDS/HPES was the only contractor who submitted a response to this ENCORE II RFP which was awarded as Contract HC1028-08-D-2018 TO 0005 to EDS/HPES.</p>
<p>An award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition. Even though DADS and DTOOLS are termed support tools/systems, they provide critical logistical and real-time monitoring capabilities to operational Command and Control DMS/NGC communications. Backbone network support under the task order is critical to both the operational network (due to the interface architecture of the two networks), the Detrick test development facility (TDF), and Page 3 of 7 Pages</p>
<p>LANs supporting Fort Detrick DISA personnel. There can be no break or degradation in services provided under this acquisition without potential for adverse affects on the Command and Control messaging mission. It is not acceptable to have a period of time when the contractor is unable to complete task order requirements. For another contractor to learn these one-of-a-kind systems and gain the required experience necessary to complete the requirements of this acquisition, it is estimated that simultaneous duplicative task orders would be required for a 12 month period. To award a duplicative one year task order to allow another contractor to learn the DADS/DTOOLS products and the network architecture/backbone component's security and configurations, would cost an estimated $1,452,000.00 (6 personnel X $242K per TSY = $1,452). This additional duplicative cost required to train another contractor in order to increase competition could not be supported in the current environment of reduced program budgets where only essential sustainment tasking can be funded. Additionally, the duplicative costs to transfer expertise to another contractor could not be justified based upon the uncertainty of the future of current organizational messaging systems and the continuing requirement for services provided under this acquisition. There is currently no approved way-ahead for DMS beyond 2012 so it is possible that requirements under this acquisition will not be required beyond this acquisition's two year timeframe. Given the limited remaining life expectancy for the current operational organizational messaging systems, any potential savings in awarding this tasking to another contractor would not offset the $1,452K investment necessary to transfer the expertise to another party.</p>
<p>The messaging tools and services supported under this acquisition have operational support requirements which must be completed in the Ft. Detrick NGC Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). The contractor must have a qualified staff with approximately 70% cleared for Top Secret and the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and collateral accesses required for SCIF access immediately upon task order award. There can be no lapse in on-site NGC tool problem analysis and technical support, so personnel security clearances/accesses are critical qualifying requirements for this acquisition.</p>
